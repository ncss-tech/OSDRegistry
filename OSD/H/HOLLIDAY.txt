HOLLIDAY SERIES

The Holliday series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in sediments derived dominantly from mixed igneous rocks.  Holliday soils are on alluvial fans and fan piedmonts with slopes of 4 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 59 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic Ustic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Holliday sandy loam - rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 2 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/3) sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak medium platy structure; soft and loose, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary (0 to 5 inches thick).

    BCt1--33 to 51 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) very cobbly sandy loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; sand grains coated with oriented clay; 15 percent gravel and 40 percent cobble; neutral; clear smooth boundary (15 to 20 inches thick).

    BCt2--51 to 70 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) extremely cobbly sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; massive and single grain; soft and loose, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; sand grains coated with oriented clay; 20 percent gravel and 45 percent cobble; neutral; clear smooth boundary (0 to 20 inches thick).

    C--70 to 83 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) extremely cobbly sand, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; single grain; loose; few very fine roots; 20 percent gravel and 45 percent cobble; neutral.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Caralampi (AZ), Coxwell (NM), Hartpeak (CA), Hoppswell (NV), Maloy (AZ) and Monza (NM) series.  Caralampi, Hoppswell, Monza, and Maloy soils contain more than 18 percent clay.  Coxwell, Hartpeak, and Monza soils have bedrock at moderate depths.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Holliday soils are on alluvial fans and fan piedmonts.  Slopes range from 4 to 12 percent.  Elevations range from 4,200 to 5,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 13 inches.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 57 to 63 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 160 to 190 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Soledad soils and the Aladdin, Caralampi, Coxranch, Earp, and Hawkeye soils.  Aladdin, Earp and Hawkeye soils have mollic epipedons.  Caralampi soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Coxranch soils have sandy clay loam argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation includes three-awn, fluffgrass, black grama, bush muhly, prickly pear, snakeweed, Mormontea, catclaw and mesquite.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern New Mexico.  The series is of small extent.  MLRA is 42

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Dona Ana County, New Mexico, (Desert Project); 1997

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 2 inches (A horizon)

Argillic horizon - The zone from 2 to 33 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4 horizons)

This series represents an identified soil on the Cox Ranch near the Desert Soil-Geomorphology Project, Las Cruces, New Mexico.  The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment.  The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.  Revision outside the project area is discouraged in order to preserve the historical concept for research.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Data from the pedon at site 2 (in Gile, L.H. 1987. Late Holocene displacement along the Organ Mountains fault in southern New Mexico.  New Mexico Bureau of Mines and Mineral Resources Circular 196) support the classification.  Data from five additional sites in the same report also illustrate Holliday soils.
