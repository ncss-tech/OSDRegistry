HOOPER SERIES

The Hooper series consists of very deep, well drained or moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from igneous and metamorphic rock.  Hooper soils are on flood plains, alluvial fans, alluvial flats, shrub-coppice dunes, and deflation basins. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no known series in this family.  Closely related soils are the Mosca and Goshute series.  Mosca soils have a coarse-loamy control section.  Goshute soils do not have visible salt crystals in the upper solum and have a mesic temperature regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: alluvial materials derived from mixed sources (igneous and metamorphic rock). Commonly rhyolite, andesite, basalt, gneiss, and schist.
Landform: Flood plains, alluvial fans, alluvial flats, shrub-coppice dunes, and deflation basins with slopes of 0 to 4 percent.
Mean annual precipitation: 6 to 9 inches (152 to 229 millimeters)
Mean annual air temperature: 39 to 46 degrees F (4.0 to 7.8 degrees C)
Elevation ranges from 6,500 to 8,000 feet (1,980 to 2440 meters), and the Frost Free Period ranges from 85 to 100 days.
Precipitation pattern: Precipitation peaks in July and August occurring mostly as intense summer thunderstorms.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the San Luis, Cososa, and Mosca soils. 
Mosca soils do not have visible salts in the solum.
San Luis soils are somewhat poorly drained.
Cososa soils do not have natric horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained or moderately well drained; low runoff; slow to very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally as native pastureland. Principal native vegetation includes thin stands of greasewood with some rabbitbrush. Occasionally, there is scattered alkali sacaton and saltgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  San Luis Valley Area of south-central Colorado, LRR E, MLRA 51. Also some small areas in LRR D, MLRA 34 in Wyoming.  The series is of large extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Rio Grande County, Colorado, 1972; proposed in 1945. The typical pedon is in the Alamosa Area, Colorado, but it is not the modal pedon in that area.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Particle-size control section: from 5 to 40 inches (Btn, Btnz, Bnz, and upper part of 2C horizon)
Ochric epipedon and albic horizon: from 0 to 5 inches (E horizon)
Natric horizon: from 5 to 32 inches (Btn and Btnz horizons)
Strongly contrasting particle-size class: at 32 inches. The sandy clay loam Bnz is assumed to have less than 50 percent fine sand and coarser sand; the weighted average noncarbonate clay in the upper part of the PSCS is assumed greater than 18 percent.

The 09/2008 revison changed the particle-size family from clayey over sandy or sandy-skeletal to fine-loamy over sandy or sandy skeletal, with the accompanying change of the mineralogy class from smectitic to mixed.

The parent material is more accurately defined as being derived from mixed sources (igneous and metamorphic rock); the original concept was being derived from volcanic rock, jwb, 4/2009 

This series has historically beeen recognized with a highly variable depth to water table- within 4 feet to greater than 6 feet. The 12/2011 revision provisionally retains the original water table criterion, but it is likely the central concept of this series will be revised to have no saturation within the series control section (150 cm). Drainage class would then be well drained only. More field investigation will be required before this change can definitely be made.
