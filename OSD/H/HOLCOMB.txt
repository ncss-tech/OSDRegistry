REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features in this pedon
*Particle-size control section--zone from 61 to 111 cm
*Mollic epipedon--zone from the surface to a depth of 46 cm
*Albic horizon--zone from 46 to 61 cm
*Argillic horizon-- zone from 61 to 127 cm
*Depth to abrupt textural change--61 cm
*Depth to lithologic discontinuity--61 cm to 127 cm

The Holcomb soils are on the Senecal geomorphic surface in the Willamette Valley of Oregon. The first lithologic discontinuity represents a change in parent material from alluvium deposited by local drainageways to Missoula Flood sediment.

11/2017--This official series description was updated according to SSR01 Technical Note 11--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 11/2017). The classification was changed from Typic Argialbolls to Xeric Argialbolls based on recognition of a period of dryness following the summer solstice that has been consistently recognized throughout the Willamette Valley. The twelfth edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy was used for this reclassification. The competing series were updated also. Most of the other changes were in formatting.
