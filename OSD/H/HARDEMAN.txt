HARDEMAN SERIES

The Hardeman series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils formed in moderately coarse textured eolian and alluvial sediments. These soils occur on nearly level to moderately steep treads and risers of stream terraces on dissected alluvial plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm (25 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Hardeman fine sandy loam--cropland.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Shrewder series in the same family. Similar soils are the Deepwood, Dill, Enterprise, Mobeetie, Spade, and Woodward series.
Dill soils are moderately deep over weakly cemented sandstone and are noneffervescent throughout the solum. 
Deepwood, Enterprise and Woodward soils have less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser in the particle-size control section. 
Mobeetie soils are strongly effervescent throughout and are dry in some part of the control section for more than half of the time during most years. 
Spade soils have sandstone within 51 to 122 cm (20 to 48 in)
Shrewder soils do not have secondary carbonates within 71 cm (28 in) and have soft sandstone within 203 cm (80 in). 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent Material: moderately coarse textured eolian and/or alluvial sediments that have been reworked by wind. Most areas have at least a thin mantle of eolian sediments over alluvium.
Landscape: dissected alluvial plains
Landform: convex to plane, treads and risers of stream terraces
Slope: dominantly 1 to 5 percent, but ranges from 0 to 20 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 508 to 737 mm (20 to 29 in)
Thornthwaite P-E indices: 32 to 44 
Mean annual temperature: 13.9 to 18.3 degrees C (57 to 65 degrees F)
Frost free days: 190 to 230 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Arnett, Enterprise, Deepwood, Devol, Grandfield, Hilgrave, Jester, Miles, Quinlan, Shrewder, Springer, Tivoli and Woodward series.
Arnett, Devol, Grandfield, Hilgrave, Miles and Springer soils have an argillic horizon and occur on higher positions. In addition, the Arnett, Grandfield, Hilgrave, and Miles soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.
Deepwood, Enterprise and Woodward soils have a coarse-silty particle-size control section and occur on similar positions.
Quinlan soils have bedrock at less than 51 cm (20 in) and occur on higher positions.
Shrewder soils do not have secondary calcium carbonates within 71 cm (28 in) and occur on similar positions.
Jester and Tivoli soils are sandy throughout and do not have a B horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderately rapid. Runoff is negligible on slopes less than 1 percent, very low on 1 to 5 percent slopes, and low on 5 to 20 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: Slopes less than 5 percent are used mostly for sorghum, cotton, and wheat production. Native vegetation is mostly grama grasses, little bluestem, sand dropseed, and buffalograss in southern areas. Northern areas also include sand bluestem, switchgrass, indiangrass and sand lovegrass. Sand sagebrush is a common invader.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Rolling Red Plains, Western and Eastern Parts (MLRA 78B, 78C) of Texas and Oklahoma. The series is of moderate extent.
