HASKILL SERIES

The Haskill series consists of deep sandy soils developed in wind modified sandy deposits on terraces and outwash fans.  These soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.  Mean annual precipitation is 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is 42 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 110 days.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Haskill loamy fine sand, (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

	A -- 0 to 2 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very fine sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; loose; slightly firm nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; abrupt boundary.  (1 to 3 inches think)

	E -- 2 to 10 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loamy fine sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; soft; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; slightly acid to neutral; gradual boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)

	E/Bt -- 10 to 27 inches; E part; pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) loamy fine sand; loose and soft both dry and moist; nonsticky and nonplastic; Bt part; brown (7.5YR 5/2) loam, dark brown (7.5 3/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; slightly acid to neutral; abrupt boundary.(10 to 20 inches thick)

	Bt -- 27 to 32 inches; variated light brown (7.5YR 6/4) and brown (7.5YR 5/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) and dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure separating to fine subangular blocky and single grains; thin patchy clay films on faces of peds; hard, firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; neutral; clear boundary.  (3 to 7 inches thick)

	C -- 32 to 72 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) fine sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; single grained, loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; strongly effervescent; common medium masses of lime.

TYPE LOCATION:  Near Columbia Falls, Flathead County, Montana; 765 feet west of the SE corner of Sec. 9, T. 30 N., R. 21 W.  On the north side of the highway.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Haskill soils are on terraces and outwash fans.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  The steeper slopes are on dune-like areas.  Most of the area has undulating and low hummocky relief typical of areas of blown sand.  Mean annual precipitation is15 to 20 inches.  The frost-free period is 105 to 125 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; no runoff; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Haskill soils are in coniferous forest, but some areas have been cleared and are uesd for grazy and hay production.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Haskill soils are of small extent in the Flathead Valley.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Upper Flathead Valley area, Flathead County, Montana, 1957.  The name is that of a mountain pass in Flathead County.

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretations Record:  MT0071.  The Haskill series was formerly included with the Gray Wooded soils.  The ochric epipedon, 
the argillic horizon, and the ustic moisture regime places these soils in the Alfisols.  The frigid argillic horizon is more than 60 centimeters below the surface plus the tonguing of albic material in the argillic horizon places them in the Paleboralfs.
