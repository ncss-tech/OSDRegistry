HUTCHLEY SERIES  

The Hutchley series consists of shallow, well drained soils that are formed in residuum and colluvium derived from quartz latite and other related volcanic rocks and metasedimentary rocks. They are on cuestas, hills, mountainsides, plateaus and ridges.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C and the mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Anaud, Bellenmine, Celeridge, Cleavage, Cleavmor, Cropper, Gabica, Gaciba, Genoa, Gerdog, Gidwin, Granquin, Grosschat, Hawkridge, Loope, Mascamp, Melling, Pernog, Pernty, Rozara, Shalcleav, Shalper, Slatter, Tractuff, and Tweener series.  

Anaud and Granquin soils are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days during the summer.  Bellenmine soils have less than 28 percent clay in the lower part of the argillic horizon and the mollic epipedon is 13 to 25 cm thick.  Celeridge, Gerdog, Hawkridge, and Loope soils lack a subhorizon with more that 27 percent clay.  Cleavage soils have a mollic epipedon that does not include the Bt horizon, a longer frost-free season and a higher average soil temperature.  Cleavmor soils have filaments or masses of calcium carbonate in the argillic horizon.  Cropper soils have a mollic epipedon that is 18 to 25 cm thick.  Gabica soils are neutral to medium acid and have 457 to 635 mm of annual precipitation.  Gaciba soils average less than 22 percent clay in the Bt horizon.  Genoa soils have rock fragments that are granitic. Gidwin soils have 18 to 24 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Mascamp soils have lime coatings on the lithic contact, have less than 305 mm of annual precipitation and slopes less than 15 percent.  Pernog soils are very strong in the argillic horizon.  Pernty soils have mollic epipedons less than 25 cm thick.  Rozara soils have 14 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Shalcleav soils have a very channery textural modifier in the upper part of the Bt horizon.  Shalper soils have silica accumulation on the rock fragments in the Bt horizon.  Tweener soils are 18 to 30cm to bedrock.  Grosschat soils mollic epipedon does not include any of the subsoil horizons.  Melling soils have an aridic soil moisture regime.  Slatter soils are very shallow.  Tractuff soils have 1 to 10 percent calcium carbonate throughout the argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hutchley soils are on cuestas, hills, mountainsides, plateaus and ridges.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  Elevation is 3,400 to 9,000 feet.  The soils formed in alluvium, residuum, and colluvium derived from quartz latite, basalt, or related volcanic rocks and  metasedimentary rocks with some loess influence.  The mean annual precipitation is 305 to 508 mm, the mean annual air temperature is 3 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 30 to 90 days.  

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Heglar, Rexburg, Vitale, and Watercanyon series.  Heglar, Rexburg, and Watercanyon soils have coarse-silty control sections.  Vitale soils are 50 to 100 cm deep.  Heglar soils are on west-facing mountainsides.  Rexburg soils are on north-facing mountainsides.  Vitale soils are on south-facing mountainsides.  Watercanyon soils are on similar positions as Hutchley soils.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to very rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.  

USE AND VEGETATION: Hutchley soils are used for rangeland.  The potential native vegetation is low sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Sandberg bluegrass.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Hutchley soils are of moderate extent.
