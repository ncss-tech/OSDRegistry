HONDALE SERIES

The Hondale series consists of very deep, well-drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sediments.  Elevations are about 4250 feet.  Average annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  (See Remarks)

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Natrargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Hondale loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    E-- 0 to 5 inches, light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) loam, dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2) moist; weak thin platy parting to moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable; common fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine vesicular pores; violently effervescent moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (O to 8 inches thick)

(4 to 10 inches thick)

    Bk1--17 to 35 inches, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) clay, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure that part to moderate medium subangular blocky; soft; very friable; sticky and plastic; few very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; contains splotches and a few very fine seams of segregated lime; strongly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.  (O to 20 inches thick)

    Bk2--35 to 41 inches, light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; slightly sticky and plastic; few very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent medium irregular shaped concretions of lime, very strongly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Bk3--41 to 60 inches, pinkish white (5YR 8/2) loam, pinkish gray (5YR 7/2) moist; massive; hard, very friable moist; slightly sticky; common fine and very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent caliche marl; strongly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Luna County New Mexico; about 100 feet south of the center of the SW 1/4 of section 8, T. 24 S., R. 8 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

The solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches thick. 

Soil moisture - dry in all parts three-fourths or more of the time. Typic aridic moisture regime.

Soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.

Conductivity averages 6 dS/m but ranges from 4 to l6 dS/m.

SAR - ranges from 15 to 30 percent.

Pedons with some gypsum crystals in the lower B and C horizons are permitted in the series.

Most eroded pedons lack an A and E horizons. Where present the A horizon ranges from 2 to 8 inches in thickness.

A horizon 
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR
Value:  4 or 5
Chroma:  2 to 4 

E horizon 
Hue:  5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR
Value:  5 to 7
Chroma:  3 or 4
Texture:  loam, silt loam and silty clay loam but some pedons have sandy loam or loamy sand surfaces.
Reaction:  moderately or strongly alkaline.

Bt1 horizon 
Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR and 10YR 
Value:  4 to 7
Chroma:  2 to 6 
Texture:  clay, silty clay, clay loam or silty clay loam.
Clay content:  ranges from 35 to 50 percent.
Reaction:  strongly or very strongly alkaline. 

Bk1 horizon 
Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR and 10YR
Value:  4 to 6
Chroma:  2 to 4 
Texture:  clay, clay loam, silty clay and silty clay loam.
Reaction: strongly or very strongly alkaline.

Bk2 horizons 
Hue:  5YR, 7.5YR and 10YR
Value:  7 or 8
Chroma: 2 or 3
Reaction:  strongly to very strongly alkaline 
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  50 to 70 percent
Texture:  dominantly clay loam or loam but where stratified some pedons have strata of sandy loam and sandy clay loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hondale soils are in mixed sediments on old alluvial plains and fans that commonly terminate at a bolson. Flooding is rare. Elevations range from 3500 to 5000 feet. Slopes range from O to 3 percent. The average annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 11 inches with most falling in the summer. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 57 to 65 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Jal, Mimbres, Verhalen, and Ubar soils.  Jal soils are in a fine-loamy carbonatic family and lack a natric horizon.  Mimbres soils are in a fine-silty family without an argillic or natric horizon.  Ubar soils lack a natric horizon.  Verhalen soils are in a fine smectitic family having mollic epipedon and lacking natric and argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well-drained, slow runoff, and very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Range, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Small acreages are irrigated for barley, cotton, grain sorghum, and alfalfa.  Native vegetation is alkali sacaton, fourwing saltbush, vine-mesquite, burrograss, tobosa, threeawn, mesquite, tubercled saltbush, seepweed, and iodinebush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern New Mexico and Southeastern Arizona.  The series is extensive. MLRAs 41 & 42.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Luna County New Mexico, 1975.

REMARKS: (Additional study is needed, to clearly define and classify this series.)

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Albic horizon - the zone from 0 to 5 inches (E horizon)

Argillic horizon - the zone from 5 to 17 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)

Particle size control section - the zone from 5 to 17 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons

(ADDITIONAL DATA: In 1992, the original type location was sampled for characterization (S92NM-029-003).  Data indicates that there is enough clay size carbonate to change the classification from fine to fine-loamy. SAR values range from 32 to over 100.  Two pedons sampled in Grant County have very little carbonate.  One pedon classified fine (S76-NM-17-22-{1-10}), while the other one is fine-silty (S76-NM-17-26{1-9}).  With this in mind the series is not being updated until it can be studied further.lwh.  The 1992 recommendation is still a valid recommendation this is only a format update.  The pedon sample in Grant County may be in a different moisture and precipitation zone and also a different MLRA (38).
