Cowiche soils have less than 5 percent rock fragments in the argillic horizon, have a 2Bk horizon with carbonate accumulation and do not have lamellae. Fernpoint soils have stratified extremely gravelly or extremely cobbly 2C horizons, secondary CaCO3 at 40 inches, and a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 51 degrees. Indiano, Madras, Quiero and Simcoe soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact. Jerusalem soils do not have lamellae below the argillic horizon and have base saturation of 50 to 75 percent in some part. Margerum soils have pumice throughout the particle-size control section. Orr soils are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and do not have lamellae below the argillic horizon. Quailridge soils are less than 25 inches deep the base of the argillic horizon. Ralls soils are less than 25 inches deep to the base of the argillic horizon and have silt loam and clay loam textures with less than 45 percent sand in the particle-size control section. Springmeyer and Truax soils are dry for more than 145 days during summer and fall and do not have lamellae. In addition, Truax soils have Bq horizons. Wenatchee soils have less than 20 percent medium and coarse sand in the particle-size control section and do not have lamellae.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hullsgulch soils are moderately sloping to very steep hill backslopes, summits and shoulders and on landslides at elevations of 2,700 to 3,900 feet. Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent. These soils formed in granitic sediments deposited as basin-margin subaqueous deltas. The average annual precipitation is 12 to 17 inches. The average annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free period is 120 to 155 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cranegulch, Piercepark and Quailridge soils. Cranegulch soils have more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Piercepark soils have mollic epipedons 20 to 30 inches thick. Quailridge soils are less than 25 inches to the base of the argillic horizon. These soils occur on similar geomorphic positions as the Hullsgulch soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for rangeland and commonly for homesites. Native vegetation is basin big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, bluebunch wheatgrass and Thurber needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West-central Idaho. MLRA 10. Hullsgulch soils are of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Boise County Area, Idaho, Parts of Ada and Boise Counties, 2005. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
Mollic epipedon - zone from the surface to 12 inches (A and BA horizons)
Argillic horizon - zone from 12 to 38 inches (Bt1, Bt2 and Bt3 horizons)
Particle-size control section - zone from 12 to 32 inches 
Soil moisture regime - aridic bordering on xeric

These soils are drier than other Xerolls in the region under similar precipitation due to early runoff and extended period of high evapotranspiration.
