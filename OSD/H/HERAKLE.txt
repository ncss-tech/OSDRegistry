HERAKLE SERIES

The Herakle series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from limestone and/or sandstone.  These soils are on mountain slopes and hogbacks with slopes of 5 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Lithic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Herakle very channery loam on a 20 percent slope in woodland at an elevation of 9,500 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted) Described on September 30, 1981.

    Btk--8 to 12 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very channery clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common prominent clay films on faces of peds; 36 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in 20 mm and less fraction; 45 percent limestone channers; common medium carbonate concretions on bottom of rock fragments; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)

    Bk--12 to 17 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) very channery loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; 50 percent limestone channers, 5 percent flagstones; 58 percent calcium carbonate equivalent, many coarse carbonate masses in the matrix; many coarse carbonate concretions on bottom of rock fragments; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt irregular boundary.  (3 to 10 inches thick)

    R--17 to 60 inches; indurated limestone.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Hapjack, Redfern, Snowdon, Whiteman series.
The Hapjack, Redfern, Snowdon, and Whiteman soils do not have calcic horizons.
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: slope alluvium derived from limestone and/or sandstone, commonly Mississippian or Pennsylvanian age
Landform: mountain slopes and hogbacks
Slopes: 5 to 70 percent
Elevation: 8,500 to 10,000 feet
Mean annual temperature: 35 to 44 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 14 to 18 inches and about 10 to 12 inches falls during April through August
Precipitation pattern: Monthly precipitation is lowest in winter and greatest in July and August.
Frost-free season: 50 to 80 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Soils are used for woodland, recreation, wildlife habitat, and limited homesite development.  Native vegetation is mainly Douglas fir and ponderosa pine with some limber pine and bristlecone pine.  The understory includes Arizona fescue, mountain muhly, and common juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mountainous areas of central Colorado; MLRA 48A.  The series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Fremont County Area, Colorado, 1988. The typical pedon is in the Pike and San Isabel NF, Northern Part soil survey. The name is from a nearby summer homesite.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic features and horizons recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section: The zone from 0 to 17 inches.
Particle-size control section: The zone from 4 to 12 inches. (Bt, Btk horizons)
Calcic horizon: from 8 to 17 inches. (Btk, Bk horizons)
Ochric epipedon: from 1 to 4 inches. (E horizon)
Albic horizon: from 1 to 4 inches. (E horizon)
Argillic horizon: from 4 to 12 inches. (Bt, Btk horizons)
Lithic contact: 17 inches (R horizon)

When established the classification was loamy-skeletal, mixed Lithic Cryoboralfs.
