HIGHROCK SERIES

The Highrock series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from basalt over lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sources.  Highrock soils are on lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

Uffens soils do not have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates or visible sodium salts.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Highrock soils are on lake terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from basalt over lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sources.  Small hummocks of eolian sand occur around bases of large shrubs.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 4,000 to 4,050 feet.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 8 inches, mean annual temperature is 49 to 52 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Clems, Mazuma, and Wespac soils.  Clems and Mazuma soils are coarse-loamy.  Wespac soils are dry less than 200 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; high surface runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Highrock soils are used for rangeland.  The vegetation is mainly black greasewood, spiny hopsage, basin wildrye, and bud sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern California.  These soils are not extensive with about 4,300 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 27.
