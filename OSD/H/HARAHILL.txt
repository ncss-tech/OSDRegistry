HARAHILL SERIES



The Harahill series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on

basalt plains and foothills.  They formed in material weathered from

basalt and rhyolite.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes are 0 to 30

percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the

average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Ultic Haploxerolls



TYPICAL PEDON:  Harahill loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil

unless otherwise noted.)



    A1--0 to 4 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3)

moist; moderate very thin platy structure that parts to moderate very

fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly

plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial

pores; 10 percent pebbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth

boundary.  (3 to 5 inches thick)



    A2--4 to 12 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) loam, dark reddish brown (5YR

3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable,

slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, few

medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 5

percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 10

inches thick)



    Bw--12 to 20 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) loam, dark reddish brown

(5YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure that parts to

moderate fine and medium subangular blocky; hard, firm, sticky and

plastic; common very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; many

fine tubular pores; few thin clay films on faces of peds and in pores;

10 to 15 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.3); clear wavy boundary.

(7 to 13 inches thick)



    BC--20 to 26 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) very gravelly loam, dark

reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky

structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly

plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine tubular pores;

few thin clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 15 percent cobbles

and 45 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.3); gradual irregular

boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)



    R--26 inches; basalt with decomposition in the upper 3 inches.



TYPE LOCATION:  Camas County, Idaho; about 1 mile west and 2 miles

north of Hill City, at a point 250 feet west and 1,300 feet north of

the southest corner of section 18, T. 1 S., R. 12 E.



RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:



Average annual soil temperature - 41 to 47 degrees F

Depth to bedrock - 24 to 40 inches

Mollic epipedon thickness - 20 to 28 inches

Reaction in profile - slightly or moderately acid

Base saturation - 50 to 75 percent in some part above 30 inches

Rock fragments in control section - 5 to 25 percent pebbles, cobbles,

and stones



A horizon

Hue - 5YR through 10YR

Value - 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist

Chroma - 2 or 3



Bw horizon

Hue - 5YR or 7.5YR

Value - 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist

Chroma - 2 through 6

Texture - SIL, L, CL, ST-SIL, ST-L, ST-CL, CB-L

Clay content - 20 to 30 percent



COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Childs, Congle(T), Kahler, and M?Garr

series.  Childs soils are deeper than 60 inches to bedrock.  Kahler

soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock.  M?Garr soils have an 0

horizon.  Congle soils are greater than 40 inches to bedrock.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Harahill soils are on basalt plains and foothills

and have 0 to 30 percent slopes.  Elevations are 4,800 to 6,000 feet.

The soils formed in residuum and alluvium weathered from basalt or

rhyolite.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16

inches.  Average January temperature is 15 degrees F, the average July

temperature is 66 degrees F, and the average annual air temperature is

39 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 60 to 100 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Laurentzen and

Polecreek soils.  Laurentzen soils are more than 40 inches deep to

bedrock.  Polecreek soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to bedrock and have

a clay B2t horizon.  These soils are on landscape positions similar to

the Harahill soil.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to rapid runoff;

moderate permeability.



USE AND VEGETATION:  The soils are used for rangeland.  Vegetation in

the potential natural plant community is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass,

Idaho fescue, mountain big sagebrush, lupine, and arrowleaf balsam

root.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Basalt plains at high elevations in

south-central and southwestern Idaho.  The series is inextensive.
