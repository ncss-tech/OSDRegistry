HUFFINE SERIES

The Huffine series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in silty alluvium or loess. They are on alluvial fans and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.
 
TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Huffine silty clay loam - cropland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

    Ap--0 to 5 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) silty clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak thick platy structure parting to moderate medium granular; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine pores; abrupt boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

    Bt--5 to 15 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine and very fine roots and pores; faint continuous clay films on faces of peds; clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 11 inches thick)

    Bk--15 to 20 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots and pores; many soft masses and common filaments of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; gradual boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)

    Ck1--20 to 24 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common soft masses of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; gradual boundary.  (3 to 7 inches thick)

    Ck2--24 to 35 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 5 percent lime-coated gravel; strongly effervescent; clear boundary.  (5 to 12 inches thick)

    2C3--35 to 60 inches; multi-colored loose sand and gravel.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well-drained; moderate permeability

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used as dry and irrigated hayland and cropland.  Principal native vegetation is bluegrass, Idaho fescue, bluebunch, wheatgrass, rosebush, and cottonwood.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Gallatin County, Montana, 1931.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: a mollic epipedon from the surface to 15 inches (Ap and Bt horizons); an argillic horizon which is the particle-size control section from 5 to 15 inches (Bt horizon); accumulation of carbonates from 15 to 35 inches (Bk, Ck1 and Ck2 horizons); a lithologic discontinuity from 35 to 60 inches (2C3 horizon). Huffine soils have a ustic moisture regime and a cryic temperature regime.
