HOFFLAND SERIES

The Hoffland series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils formed in sandy eolian deposits on swales on interdunes on sandhills of the Nebraska Sandhills (MLRA 65). Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 43 centimeters (17 inches), and the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. (47 degrees F.) at the type location. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Mollic Endoaquepts 

TYPICAL PEDON: Hoffland fine sandy loam on a swale in native grass with less than 1 percent slope from a map unit of Wildhorse-Hoffland complex, 0 to 3 percent slopes. When described, the soil was moist throughout. (Colors are for wet soil unless otherwise stated.)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landscape: sandhills
Landform: swales on interdunes
Slopes: 0 to 1 percent 
Elevation: 762 to 1189 meters (2500 to 3900 feet)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Crowther, Els, Ipage, Marlake, Valentine, and Wildhorse soils.
Crowther soils are on similar swales on interdunes, are coarse loamy over sandy or sandy skeletal in the control section, and have mollic epipedons.
Els soils are slightly higher on swales on interdunes and are somewhat poorly drained having a seasonal zone of saturation or aquic conditions beginning at 46 centimeters (18 inches). 
Ipage soils are higher on hummocks on interdunes and are moderately well drained having a seasonal zone of saturation or aquic conditions beginning at 91 centimeters (36 inches).
Marlake soils are in depressions on interdunes and are very poorly drained having a seasonal zone of saturation or aquic conditions beginning at the surface and having ponding up to 61 centimeters (24 inches). 
Valentine soils are on higher hummocks and dunes and are excessively drained having no seasonal zone of saturation or aquic conditions.
Wildhorse soils are slightly higher on swales on interdunes, are somewhat poorly drained having a seasonal zone of saturation or aquic conditions beginning at 46 centimeters (18 inches), and have a sodium adsorption ration greater than 13 in half or more of the upper 51 centimeters (20 inches) 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage: poorly drained and very poorly drained 
Runoff: negligible
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: high 
Ponding frequency: frequent on the very poorly drained soil
Ponding duration: long on the very poorly drained soil with a depth of up to15 centimeters (6 inches) 

USE AND VEGETATION: The major use is livestock grazing and haying. The rangeland native plant community for the wet subirrigated ecological site (RO65XY023NE) is mostly big bluestem, prairie cordgrass, switchgrass, yellow indiangrass and tall dropseed; for the wetland ecological site (R065XY022NE) it is mostly prairie cordgrass, northern reedgrass, bluejoint reedgrass, slender wheatgrass, sedges, and rushes. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: In the western sandhills of Nebraska and sandhills of southwestern South Dakota (MLRA 65, LRR G). The series is of moderate extent.
