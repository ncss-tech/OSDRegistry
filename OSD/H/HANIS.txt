HANIS SERIES

The Hanis series consists of deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous sandy clay loams and
sandy clays.  These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping uplands.  Slopes are mostly less than 2 percent but range up to 5 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, hyperthermic Pachic Paleustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hanis sandy clay loam--cultivated.
       (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     Ap--0 to 4 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 4/2) sandy clay loam,
dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky and weak medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable; common fine
roots; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

     A1--4 to 9 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 4/2) sandy clay loam,
very dark brown (7.5YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky and moderate medium granular structure; hard, friable; common fine roots; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)

     B21t--9 to 15 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) sandy
clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 2/3) moist; moderate medium blocky structure; hard, firm; common fine roots; few fine pores; thin
patchy clay films on surfaces of peds; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.  (4 to 12 inches thick)

     B22t--15 to 25 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) sandy clay,
dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium
blocky structure; very hard, firm; few fine roots; few fine pores; thin patchy clay films on surfaces of peds, mildly alkaline;
gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 16 inches thick)

     B23t--25 to 37 inches; red (2.5YR 4/6) sandy clay, dark red (2.5YR 3/6) moist; with a few dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) streaks
to 2 mm wide; moderate fine blocky structure; very hard, very
firm; few roots and fine pores; clay films on surfaces of peds;
few calcium carbonate concretions in lower few inches; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (8 to 20 inches thick)

     B24tca--37 to 46 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/8) sandy clay, yellowish red (5YR 4/8) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; patchy clay films on surfaces of peds; an estimated 5 percent by volume of fine concretions and soft bodies
of calcium carbonate; calcareous; moderately alkaline; gradual
wavy boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

     B3ca--46 to 72 inches; reddish yellow (5YR 6/8) sandy clay
loam, yellowish red (5YR 5/8) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; few patchy clay films on surfaces of
peds; few Fe-Mn concretions; about 10 percent by volume of soft bodies and concretions of calcium carbonate; calcareous;
moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Medina County, Texas; 14.8 miles south of U.S.  Highway 90 in Hondo, Texas, on Farm Road 462; 2.0 miles east on
Farm Road 2200; 1.0 mile south and east on county road; site is
700 feet south of road in cultivated field.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 60 to more than 90 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches thick.  Depth to secondary calcium carbonate is 28 to 48 inches.

The A and B21t horizons range from dark grayish brown to dark
reddish brown or dark brown in hues of 5YR through 10YR, values of
3 and 4, and chromas of 2 and 3.  They are sandy clay loam, loam,
or clay loam that are slightly acid through mildly alkaline.

The B22t and B23t horizons are brown or red through strong brown
in hues of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, values of 3 through 5, and chormas
of 2 through 6.  Chromas increase with depth.  They are clay or
sandy clay that are slighlty acid through moderately alkaline.
Clay content in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon is 35 to 45 percent.

The B24t and B3ca horizons are reddish to brownish and some pedons contain reddish and yellowish mottles.  Hues are 2.5YR through
7.5YR, values of 4 through 6, and chromas of 2 through 8.  Common
to many coarse mottles with chromas of more than 4 occur in pedons where the dominant chromas are 4 or less.  They are sandy clay
loam or sandy clay and contain 5 to 30 percent by volume or
visible calcium carbonate.  Some pedons contain a few fragments of sandstone below about 46 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Amphion, Hollister, Poteet,
Rotan, and Zavco series.  Amphion soils have dominant hues of 10YR
or yellower in the lower Bt horizon.  Hollister and Rotan soils
have mean annual soil temperatures of less than 72 degrees F.
Poteet soils have less than 35 percent clay in the upper 20 inches
of the Bt horizon.  Zavco soils are dry in the moisture control section for longer periods.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on nearly level to sloping uplands.  Slope gradients are dominantly less than 2 percent but range from 0 to 5 percent.  The soil formed in calcareous sandy
clay loams and sandy clays.  The climate is dry subhumid with an annual rainfall of 26 to 34 inches, mean annual temperature of 70 degrees to 74 degrees F., and annual Thornthwaite P-E indices
range from about 31 to 44.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Amphion series and the Floresville, Miguel, Uvalde, and Webb series.
Amphion and Uvalde soils are in similar positions.  Floresville
soils occur at higher elevations and have an abrupt texture change between the A and Bt horizon.  Miguel soils are distinctly mottled
in the Bt horizon.  Miguel and Webb soils are at higher
elevations.  Webb soils lack mollic epipedons.  Uvalde soils lack
Bt horizons and are calcareous.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Large areas of this soil are both dry farmed
and irrigated.  Crops grown include grain sorghums, oats, and improved pasture.  Native grasses are hooded windmill,
bristlegrsss, red grama, trichloris, and threeawn.  Woody plants include mesquite, whitebrush, lotebush condalia, blackbrush, spiny hackberry, leatherstem, yucca, and cacti.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mainly in the northern part of the Rio Grande Plain.  The series is of moderate extent
