HARLAKE SERIES

The Harlake series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in stratified clayey calcareous alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, calcareous, frigid Aridic Ustifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Harlake silty clay loam, in cropland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

COMPETING SERIES:

Lostriver (MT) - has SAR greater than 13 and EC greater than 8 mmhos/cm below the Ap horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - flood plains, stream terraces.

Elevation - 1,900 to 4,000 feet. In Colorado elevations are 6,000 to 6,800 feet; range elevation to 6000 feet in MLRA 44.

Slope - 0 to 4 percent.

Parent material - stratified clayey, calcareous alluvium.

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers.

Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 14 inches, most of which falls in the spring and early part of summer.

Mean annual air temperature - 40 to 45 degrees F.  Range mean annual air temperature to 38 degrees in MLRA 44.

Frost-free period - 100 to 135 days. In Colorado the frost-free period is 75 to 95 days; range frost-free period to 90 days in MLRA 44.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Lostriver soils and the Havre and Marvan soils.  Havre and Lostriver soils occur on similar landscapes as the Harlake soils.  Harve soils are fine-loamy and Lostriver soils have SAR greater than 13 and EC greater than 8 mmmho/cm below the A horizon.  Marvan soils have a natric horizon and more clay.  They occur in alluvium above the Harlake soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow or very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Harlake soils are used for irrigated and nonirrigated cropland.  Some areas are used for range.  The potential native vegetation is mainly green needlegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, western wheatgrass, forbs, and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Harlake soils are extensive in the plains area of Montana and Colorado and possibly the adjacent states.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Hill County, Montana, 1994.  Harlake is a coined name.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation records:  MT0101, MT0186, MT0187, MT0232, MT1008.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - from the soil surface to 7 inches (Ap horizon); soil horizons that are calcareous - from the soil surface to 60 inches (Ap, C1, C2, C3 horizons); stratification of soil material (C1, C2, C3 horizons); particle-size control section - from 10 to 40 inches (C1, C2 horizons).  Harlake soils have a frigid temperature regime and an aridic moisture regime bordering on ustic.
