HAUGEN SERIES

The Haugen series consists of moderately well drained soils that are very deep to a densic contact.  These soils formed in sandy loam till or mudflow sediments on end moraines and disintegration moraines.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum, moderately slow in the lower part of the solum, and very slow in the substratum.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TYPE LOCATION: Barron County, Wisconsin; about 1.25 miles west and 0.75 miles south of Mikana; 850 feet south and 1800 feet west of the northeast corner of sec. 29, T. 36 N., R. 10 W.; USGS Rice Lake North, Wis. Quad. Latitude - 45 degrees 34 minutes 43 seconds N. Longitude - 91 degrees 37 minutes 44 seconds W. NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the base of the argillic horizon and depth to densic contact range from 60 to more than 80 inches.  The particle-size control section averages from 6 to 17 percent clay and from 55 to 80 percent fine sand or coarser. The base saturation (by sum of cations) is less than 60 percent in some part of the argillic horizon. Rock fragments are of mixed lithology and primarily of igneous origin and include no limestone or dolomite fragments. Volume of gravel ranges from 1 to 15 percent in the surface layer and from 5 to 35 percent in the subsoil and substratum. Volume of cobbles range from 0 to 5 percent and volume of stones range from 0 to 3 percent throughout. Surface stones have coverage ranging from 0 to 3 percent. Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the solum, but ranges to neutral in the Ap horizon where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the substratum.  Redox concentrations are within 40 inches. Saturation occurs within 40 inches at some time in most years.

The A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture of the A or Ap horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.

Some pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 and 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or their gravelly analogs.

The Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or their gravelly analogs. Bw horizon with spodic colors have pH of 6.0 or greater or have less than 0.6 percent organic.

Haugen soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both).  The E part has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3. Colors with moist chroma of 3 have moist value of 6 or more or dry value of 7 or more.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: Formed in sandy loam till or mudflow sediments of Late Wisconsinan Age.
Landform: End moraines and disintegration moraines of the Superior lobe.
Slope: 2 to 15 percent.
Elevation: 800 to 1950 feet.
Mean annual air temperature: 39 to 45 degrees.
Mean annual precipitation: 28 to 33 inches.
Frost-free days: 120 to 135 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Amery, Capitola, Freeon, Glendenning, Magnor, and Santiago soils.  

The well drained Amery, somewhat poorly drained Glendenning, and very poorly drained Capitola soils are in a drainage sequence with Haugen soils. Amery soils are on more sloping or higher positions on the landscape.  Glendenning soils are on footslopes, toe slopes, or lower less sloping areas. Capitola soils are in depressions or drainageways.

The well drained Santiago soils, the moderately well drained Freeon soils, and the somewhat poorly drained Magnor soils form a drainage sequence in nearby areas where there is a silty mantle 12 to 36 inches thick.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  The potential for surface runoff is low or medium. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the subsoil, moderately slow in the lower part of the subsoil, and very slow in the substratum. Haugen soils have a perched seasonal water table at a depth of 2.5 to 3.5 feet for 1 month or more at some time during the period of September to June in most years.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of this soil are used for woodland.  Native vegetation is dominantly deciduous forest with northern red oak, northern pin oak, white oak, white ash, American basswood, quaking aspen, bigtooth aspen, American elm, yellow birch, sugar maple, and black cherry the common species.  Some areas are used for cropland or pastureland.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Wisconsin. LRR K and MLRA 90A. This soil is of moderate extent.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are: 
Particle size control section -  35 to 55 inches.
Ochric epipedon - 2 to 35 inches (A, Bw1, Bw2, E/B)).
