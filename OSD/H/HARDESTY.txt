HARDESTY SERIES

The Hardesty series consists of very deep, moderatley well drained soils that formed in alluvium having more than 60 percent volcanic ash mixed with loess in the upper part. Hardesty soils are on low terraces, in broad basins, in depressions, and on alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy, glassy, mesic Vitrandic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Hardesty ashy silt loam - woodland. (Colors for dry soil unless otherwise noted. All textures are apparent field textures)

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Achelake, Dinkels, Hardister, Mansonia, Nemire, Shiva, and Watco series. Achelake soils have sand-sized pumice throughout. Dinkels and Mansonia soils are 40 to 60 inches to a lithic contact. Hardister, Nemire, Shiva and Watco soils do not have aquic conditions or redoximorphic features within 60 inches. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hardesty soils are on low terraces along intermittent drainageways, in depressions, in broad basins and on alluvial fans at elevations of 1,500 to 3,000 feet. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. These soils formed in alluvium having more than 60 percent volcanic ash mixed with loess in the upper part. Summers are warm and dry and winters are cool and moist. The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 25 inches. The average January temperature is about 26 degrees F. and the average July temperature is about 68 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F. The frost-free season is 90 to 130 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dart, Donavan, Lenz, Opportunity (T), and Spokane soils. Dart soils are sandy and are on terraces. Donavan soils are coarse-loamy and are on toeslopes, footslopes, and backslopes of foothills and mountains. Lenz soils are loamy-skeletal, moderately deep to hard granite and are on foothills. Opportunity soils are loamy-skeletal, very deep and are on outwash terraces. Spokane soils are coarse loamy, moderately deep to weathered granite and are on foothills and mountains. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: moderately well drained; moderately high saturated conductivity. These soils are rarely flooded for brief periods from January to February.

USE AND VEGETATION: Hardesty soils are used mainly for cropland. Small grains, alfalfa and grasses are common crops. The potential natural vegetation is ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine, scattered Douglas-fir, pinegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, Oregon-grape, ninebark, rose, kinnickinnick, strawberry and yarrow. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern Washington. MLRA 44A; Small in extent.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include: 
Mollic epipedon the zone from 0 to 11 inches (A1 and A2 horizons)
Cambic horizon - the zone from 11 to 32 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons) 
Particle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of the A2, Bw1, Bw2, C1 and part of the C2.
Oxyaquic feature - the zone beginning at 23 inches having saturated layers more than 30 cumulative days 

The A horizons represent the limit of loess influence.

The 3/2010 revision reflects an update to classification from Ashy, glassy, mesic Aquic Vitrixerands to Ashy, glassy, mesic Vitrandic Haploxerolls based on lab data. 

This pedon meets criteria for the Oxyaquic subgroup. Currently, in the 11th edition of Taxonomy, there is no aquandic subgroup within the Haploxerolls Great Group.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data available for Soil Survey Sample Numbers: S05WA-063-004, S05WA-063-004 Spokane County, Washington. NSSL Pedon Numbers: 06N0191 and 06N0192 respectively.
