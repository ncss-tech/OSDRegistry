HUGOTON SERIES

The Hugoton series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy, calcareous loess deposits of Holocene age.  These soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping plains.  The slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 18 inches, and mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hugoton loam--on a 0.5 percent convex slope in cropland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Ap--0 to 8 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular structure; hard, friable; few very fine roots; slightly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt--8 to 14 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) silty clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm; common fine and very fine roots; few distinct clay films on ped surfaces; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (5 to 12 inches thick)

    Btk1--14 to 29 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm; common fine and very fine roots; few faint clay films on ped surfaces; about 3 percent visible calcium carbonate in the form of films and threads; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.

    Btk3--43 to 69 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; few faint clay films on ped surfaces; about 4 percent visible calcium carbonate in the form of films and threads; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of Btk horizons is 40 to 60 inches.)

    2Bk1--69 to 80 inches; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) fine sandy loam, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; about 5 percent visible calcium carbonate in the form of films, threads, masses; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture:  An ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.  The soil moisture control section is dry in some or all parts for more than 180 but less than 205 days, cumulative, in normal years.  July through August and December through February are the driest months.  These soils are intermittently moist from September through November and March through June.
Mean annual soil temperature: 57 to 59 degrees F.
Thickness of the mollic epipedon: 9 to 18 inches
Depth to secondary calcium carbonate: 5 to 20 inches
Depth to calcic horizon: deeper than 80 inches.
Solum thickness: more than 80 inches.
Particle-size control section: 20 to 35 percent silicate clay. Note: a clay decrease of more than 20 percent (relative) from the maximum clay content occurs within 60 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Belfon, Bigbow, Canina, Dalhart, Forgan, Vorhees, and Zella soils. 
Belfon and Zella soils are on nearly level landscape positions similar to Hugoton soils.
Bigbow, Canina, Forgan, and Hugoton soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping plains, low hills, and ridges. In addition Bigbow is in a fine-loamy family.
Dalhart and Vorhees soils are on very gently sloping to gently sloping plains, hills, and ridges.  In addition Dalhart is in a fine-loamy family.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Moderate permeability.  Runoff is negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes and low on 1 to 3 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly cultivated to corn, winter wheat, and grain sorghum.  A considerable acreage is irrigated.  Climax rangeland vegetation is dominantly short grasses with a few midgrasses and includes blue grama and buffalograss, with lesser amounts of vine-mesquite, western wheatgrass, sideoats grama, silver bluestem, wild alfalfa, and prairie clover.  This soil has been correlated to the Hardland (R077AY040OK) and Loamy Upland (R077XY015KS) range site in MLRA-77A.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwest Kansas and the Oklahoma Panhandle (MLRA-77A in LRR H).  The series is of moderate extent.
