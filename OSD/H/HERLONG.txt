HERLONG SERIES

The Herlong series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in loess over alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sources.  Herlong soils are on lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 175 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  

Soil moisture - The soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section from  May 1 to December 1 (214 days), and moist in all parts from December 15 to April 15.  The soil temperature exceeds 5 degrees C from March 1 to December 1 (275 days), and exceeds 8.5 degrees C from April 15 to November 15; Typic aridic moisture regime.

Mean annual soil temperature - 12 to 14 degrees C.

Ochric epipedon thickness - 5 to 10 cm.

Depth to base of calcic horizon - 23 to 36 cm.

Depth to bedrock - 23 to 36 cm to a lithic contact of tufa.  Tufa is a chemical sedimentary rock composed mainly of calcium carbonate and deposited from solution in the water of springs adjacent to lakes.

Other features - Uncemented parent material is present below the lithic contact; other thin layers of tufa may be present between uncemented layers of parent material.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Pennell series.  Pennell soils have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, have sodium adsorption ratios of less than 13, and do not have uncemented parent materials below the lithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Herlong soils are on lake terraces.  These soils formed in loess over alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sources.  The tufa layer is thought to have formed on a surface that was immediately offshore of ancestral Pleistocene Lake Lahontan.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevation ranges from 1,219 to 1,234 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 152 to 203 mm, the mean annual temperature is 9.5 to 11 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Calneva, Lieberman, Mazuma, McConnel, and Zorravista soils.  These soils are all very deep.  In addition, Calneva soils have a natric horizon; Lieberman soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal; Mazuma soils are coarse-loamy; McConnel soils are sandy-skeletal; and Zorravista soils are sandy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderately rapid permeability; high saturated hydraulic conductivity above the root-limiting tufa layer.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Herlong soils are used mainly for rangeland.  The vegetation is mainly shadscale, spiny hopsage, bud sagebrush, black greasewood, Indian ricegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern California.  These soils are not extensive with about 576 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 27.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 8 cm (A horizon).

Calcic horizon - The zone from 8 to 23 cm (Bkn1 and Bkn2 horizons).

Lithic contact - The boundary at 23 cm to underlying hard bedrock (2R layer).

Particle-size control section - The zone from the soil surface to 23 cm (A, Bkn1, and Bkn2 horizons).


The revision of September 2001 updated the taxonomic class from Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Calcic Petrocalcids, changed horizonation, and recognized the root-limiting layer as geologic material.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has full characterization by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as user pedon ID 81CA035001 (pedon # 81P0693).
