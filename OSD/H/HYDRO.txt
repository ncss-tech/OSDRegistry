COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Talag series.  Talag soils have more than 45 percent clay in the Btn horizons. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:   The Hydro soils are on nearly level to sloping terraces and footslopes.  They formed in very deep transported calcareous loam or clay loam materials of mixed rock origin.  The climate is cool semiarid with mean annual air temperature ranging from 45 to 48 degrees F., mean summer air temperature of 65 to 70 degrees F., a frost-free period of 95 to 150 days, and a mean annual precipitation of 10 to 15 inches with 8 to 10 inches of warm season rainfall.  Frost-free period is 100 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These were the Arvada, Fort Collins, Thurlow and Cushman soils (when previously classified as mesic).  Arvada soils do not have EB horizons and have an ESP of more than 15 in the Bt horizon.  The Fort Collins, Thurlow and Cushman soils do not have E horizons, have prismatic or blocky structured Bt horizons with neutral or moderately alkaline reaction, and have an ESP of less than 7 in any part of the Bt horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well-drained; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for irrigated and nonirrigated cropland and for rangeland.  Large areas still have western wheatgrass, prairie junegrass, blue grama, and silver sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  An extensive soil occurring in small areas widely distributed throughout the eastern and northern plains of Montana.
