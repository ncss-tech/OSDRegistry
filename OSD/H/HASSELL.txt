HASSELL SERIES

The Hassell series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from redbed siltstone, shale and sandstone from the Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous, Tertiary, and Quaternary periods.  These soils are on pediments below escarpments and/or truncated or beveled remnants of the redbed Formations.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm (14 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Tucumcari (NM) series.  Similar soils are the Armendaris, Bernardino, Forrest, McAllister, Penthouse, and White House series.  

Tucumcari series: do not have a paralithic contact within 200 cm of the surface.
None of the similar soils have vertic properties sufficient to classify in the Ustertic subgroup, and all have mixed mineralogy.  In addition, the Armendaris, Bernardino, Forrest, Penthouse, and White House soils do not have a paralithic contact within 100 cm, and the Forrest, McAllister, and Penthouse soils have calcic horizons within 100 cm of the surface.  White House soils also have more than 15 percent rock fragments.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: alluvium derived from shale from formations of Jurassic, Triassic, Permian, and Pennsylvanian age, with small amounts of eolian materials.
Landform: pediments below escarpments of redbed formations, and on truncated or beveled remnants of these formations.
Slope: 0 to 5 percent
Mean annual temperature: 15 to 16 degrees C (59 to 61 degrees F).

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Slow permeability.  Runoff is low on slopes less than 1 percent and medium on 1 to 5 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Primarily used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Present native vegetation is tobosa and grama grass and a few widely spaced yucca.  The ecological site is Clayey (R070XB053NM).
