HOGUM SERIES

The Hogum series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine sediments derived from mixed rocks. Hogum soils are on depression areas of lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Typic Endoaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Hogum silt loam-wildlife habitat. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) Small broken shell fragments occur scattered on the surface.

    Bk3--86 to 152 cm; light gray (5Y 7/1) silty clay, gray (5Y 6/1) moist; strong coarse prismatic structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine, common medium and few coarse tubular pores; 5 percent 0.6 to 1.2 cm diameter secondary calcium carbonate concretions; many (20%) white (2.5Y 8/1) coarse secondary calcium carbonate masses; common fine distinct reddish brown (5YR 4/4) redox concentrations; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

TYPE LOCATION: White Pine County, Nevada; about 2 miles west of Shoshone; about 2400 feet north and 400 feet east of the southwest corner section 3, T. 11N., R. 67E.; USGS Minerva, 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 50 minutes 41 seconds N and longitude 114 degrees 26 minutes 54 seconds W; NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Frequently ponded with 60 to 90 cm of water for a very long duration. These soils are saturated at or near the surface in the winter and spring in normal years. In the summer the saturation zone drops to below 90 cm. During dry cycles these soils dry completely and saturation drops below 150 cm. Aquic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C.
Depth to the base of the cambic horizon: 25 to 38 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 30 to 35 percent.

A horizons
Hue: 2.5Y, 5Y or 10YR
Value: 7 or 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist.
Chroma: 1 or 2, dry or moist.

Bw horizons
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist.
Chroma:1 or 2, dry and moist.
Clay content: 22 to 30 percent.
Texture: silt loam or silty clay loam.

Bk horizons
Hue: 2.5Y or 5Y.
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist
Clay content: Averages 30 to 35 percent; individual subhorizons range from 25 to 45 percent in some pedons.
Texture: silty clay loam; subhorizons of silt loam or silty clay are in some pedons.
Secondary calcium carbonate concentrations: 5 to 10 percent 1/4 to 1 inch diameter hard lime concretions. 20 to 30 percent medium to coarse soft masses of secondary calcium carbonate.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 5 to 15 percent.

COMPETING SERIES: This is theSideslide series. 

Sideslide soils have calcium carbonate equivalent ranging from 1 to 5 percent, are not subject to ponding and are saturated from April to September.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hogum soils are on depressional areas of lake plains. They formed in lacustrine sediments derived from mixed rocks. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations range from 1,710 to 1,830 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Biji and Toopits series. Biji soils have a calcic horizon, have greater than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section and are saturated at depths of 107 to 152 cm in the winter and spring. Toopits soils are moderately well drained, do not pond and lack redoximorphic features from current conditions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained and frequently ponded for very long duration; negligible runoff; moderately low high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Hogum soils are used for wildlife habitat and for livestock grazing.The native vegetation is mainly wiregrass, cinquefoil and inland saltgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Nevada, south end of Spring Valley. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28A.
