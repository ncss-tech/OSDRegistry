HILLON SERIES

The Hillon series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous loam till.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Hillon soils are on till plains, hills, and escarpments.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid Aridic Ustorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hillon loam, grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 3 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and plastic; many very fine and common fine roots; common very fine pores; mildly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (1 to 7 inches thick)

    Bk1--3 to 16 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many very fine and common fine roots; many very fine pores; many fine and medium masses of lime; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline; clear wavy boundary. (5 to 15 inches thick)

    Bk2--16 to 29 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) clay loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine pores; common fine and medium masses of lime; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline; clear wavy boundary. (5 to 25 inches thick)

    By--29 to 60 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) clay loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few very fine roots in upper part; few very fine pores; 5 percent pebbles; common fine and medium seams and masses of gypsum below 36 inches; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations records:  MT0103, MT0674, MT0610.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches, mixed (Ap, Bk1 horizons); horizons of secondary lime accumulation (Bk1, Bk2 horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bk1, Bk2, and part of By horizons).  Hillon soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
