HAMBRICK SERIES

The Hambrick series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks, dominantly shale and sandstone.  Hambrick soils are on flood-plain steps.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 10.5 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks, dominantly calcareous sandstone and shale from the Morrison and Carmel formations.
Landform:  Flood plains, flood-plain steps
Slopes:  0 to 3 percent
Elevation:  1,585 to 1,798 meters
Mean annual temperature:  8.9 to 11.7 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation:  15 to 23 cm
Precipitation pattern:  Wettest months are July to October and driest months are December and June.
Frost-free period:  130 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Casmos, Glenton, Green River, and Hadden series.  The shallow Casmos and moderately deep, sodic Hadden soils are on dissected structural benches and cuestas above the flood plain under Castle Valley saltbush, shadscale and black sagebrush.  The Glenton soils do not have a water table, are coarse-loamy and are upslope under basin big sagebrush.  The Green River soils are coarse-loamy, have a water table at 61 to 122 cm and are downslope under Fremont cottonwoods.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained, low runoff, moderately slow permeability, occasionally flooded for brief periods during the months of March through October.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Grazing and wildlife habitat.  Existing vegetation includes greasewood, alkali sacaton, fourwing saltbush, Gardner's saltbush, broom snakeweed and shadscale.  In Utah this soil is correlated to Alkali Bottom (Alkali sacaton) R034XY002UT ecological site.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Utah, Warm Central Desertic Basins and Plateaus; LRR D, MLRA 34B; small extent.  About 200 acres (80 hectares) in Emery County.
