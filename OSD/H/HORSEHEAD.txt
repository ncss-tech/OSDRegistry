HORSEHEAD SERIES

The Horsehead series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in gravelly and sandy glaciofluvial deposits on outwash plains, outwash channels, river and stream terraces, eskers, kames, deltas, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 5.6 degrees C (42 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Arenic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Horsehead sand, on a west-facing, 3 percent slope under mixed hardwoods at an elevation of 381 meters (1,250 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soils unless otherwise stated.)

 A--0 to 5 cm (2 inches); very dark gray (10YR 3/1) sand, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak medium granular structure; very friable; many very fine and fine, and common medium roots; about 1 percent gravel and 1 percent cobbles; strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [0 to 10 cm (4 inches) thick]

 Bw1--5 to 25 cm (2 to 10 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) gravelly sand; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; many very fine to coarse roots; 25 percent gravel and 2 percent cobbles; moderately acid; abrupt wavy boundary.

 Bw2--25 to 48 cm (10 to 19 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) gravelly sand; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; many very fine and fine, and common medium and coarse roots; 25 percent gravel and 2 percent cobbles; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary.

 Bw3--48 to 69 cm (19 to 27 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) gravelly sand; weak fine to coarse subangular blocky structure; very friable; few fine and very fine roots; 30 percent gravel and 3 percent cobbles; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bw horizon is 41 to 66 cm (16 to 26 inches).]

 2Bt--69 to 91 cm (27 to 36 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) very gravelly loamy sand; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; many very fine and fine, and common medium roots; discontinuous clay bridging between sand grains; 55 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary. [15 to 46 cm (6 to 18 inches) thick]

 2C--91 to 203 cm (36 to 80 inches); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly sand; single grain; loose; few very fine and fine roots; 46 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Horsehead soils are on outwash plains, outwash channels, river and stream terraces, eskers, kames, deltas, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent. The Horsehead soils formed in gravelly and sandy glaciofluvial deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 787 mm (28 to 31 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 4.4 to 6.7 degrees C (40 to 44 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Graycalm, Grayling, Klacking, Millersburg, Croswell, Au Gres, Deford, Lupton and Tawas soils. The very poorly and poorly drained Lupton, Tawas, and Deford soils occur in adjacent depressions and drainageways. The somewhat poorly drained Au Gres soils and moderately well drained Croswell soils occur on lower landscape positions. The well drained Klacking and Millersburg soils, the somewhat excessively drained Graycalm soils, and the excessively drained Grayling soils occur on similar landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat excessively drained. Potential surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high. Permeability is rapid or very rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are forested. Forest vegetation consists chiefly of northern red oak, bigtooth aspen, quaking aspen, red maple, white oak, red pine and white ash. A small part is in permanent pasture and idle land.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 94A in northern Lower Peninsula of Michigan. The series is of moderate extent.
