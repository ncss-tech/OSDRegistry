COMPETING SERIES: None

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: Coastal Plain
Landform: Low-lying uplands, broad depressions, and narrow ancient floodplains
Elevation: 5 to 80 feet
Parent Material: Stratified alluvial and marine sediments
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 52 to 58 degrees F.
Mean Annual Precipitation: 42 to 48 inches
Frost Free Period: 190 to 210 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Hammonton soils--moderately well drained, on higher landforms
Klej soils--somewhat poorly drained and have a sandy particle-size control section, on similar landforms
Pone soils--very poorly drained and have an umbric epipedon, on lower-lying landforms
Woodstown soils--moderately well drained soils and have a fine-loamy particle-size control section, on higher landforms

USE: Most areas are wooded. Some areas are cleared and used for growing corn, small grain and soybeans.

VEGETATION: Wooded areas have an overstory of sweetgum, red oak, white oak, willow oak, loblolly pine, and red maple.  Common understory species are greenbriar, American holly, highbush blueberry, and sweetbay.

DISTRIBUTION: Coastal Plain of Maryland and Delaware

EXTENT: Moderate

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Dorchester County, Maryland, 1996

REMARKS: This soil was formerly included in the Fallsington series. Laboratory data indicate a base saturation (by sum of cations) greater than 35 percent, on cropland areas, and a base saturation of less than 35 percent in woodland areas.  Scientists believe the high base saturation in this soil has been caused by long-time cropping practices (liming), and the soil would revert to a lower base saturation if the cropland areas were converted back to woodland.

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 3 to 6 inches (A horizon).
Albic horizon--the zone form 6 to 13 inches (Eg horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 13 to 25 inches (Btg horizon)
Aquic conditions--the zone from 6 inches to a depth of 80 inches is periodically saturated (endosaturation)
