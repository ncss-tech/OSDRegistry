HOGSBY SERIES

The Hogsby series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in colluvium derived from argillite and quartzite.  These soils are on mountains and hills.  Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hogsby gravelly loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A1--0 to 6 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots, many fine pores; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (6 to 10 inches thick)

    A2--6 to 15 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely channery loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many fine pores; 55 percent channers, 15 percent flagstones; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick)

    R--15 inches; quartzite bedrock.
