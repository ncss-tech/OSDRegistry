HOMA SERIES

The Homa series consists of moderately well drained, slowly
permeable soils that formed in weathered shales on uplands.  The soils are on crest and sideslopes of dissected plateaus and mountains.  These soils have medium to rapid runoff from the
surface.  Slopes range from 2 to 45 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Very-fine, mixed, active, thermic Albaquic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Homa fine sandy loam, in forest.
                (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise
stated.)

     A1--0 to 2 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) fine
sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; moderate fine and medium granular structure; very friable, slightly hard; common fine
roots; few coarse fragments of sandstone; medium acid; clear wavy boundary.  (1 to 6 inches thick)

     A2--2 to 5 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) fine sandy loam, pale
brown (10YR 6/3) dry; weak medium granular structure; very
friable, slightly hard, common fine roots; few coarse fragments of sandstone; few bodies of very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) fine sandy loam; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (1 to 8 inches thick)

     B21t--5 to 20 inches; yellowish red (5YR 4/6) clay, yellowish red (5YR 5/6) dry, with common fine and medium distinct brown
(10YR 5/3) mottles, that have gray (10YR 5/1) centers; moderate medium blocky structure; extremely firm, extremely hard; few fine roots and pores; clay films or pressure faces on peds; very
strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 18 inches thick)

     B22t--20 to 32 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay, reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) dry, with common medium distinct pale brown
(10YR 6/3) and gray (10YR 5/1) mottles; moderate medium and coarse blocky structure; extremely firm, extremely hard; clay films or pressure faces on peds; few fine black and brown concretions; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (5 to 16 inches thick)

     B3--32 to 40 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) clay, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) dry, with common medium and coarse distinct gray (10YR 5/1) and olive gray (5Y 5/2) mottles; weak
medium blocky structure; extremely firm, extremely hard; patchy
clay films or pressure faces on peds; few fine black concretions; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 13 inches thick)

     C--40 to 60 inches; coarsely mottled gray (10YR 5/1) light
olive brown (2.5Y 5/6), and pale olive (5Y 6/4) shaly clay;
massive; extremely firm, extremely hard; common strata of hard
shale; neutral.

TYPE LOCATION:  Coal County, Oklahoma.  In a wooded pasture 6
miles northeast of Coalgate, Oklahoma.  About 450 feet south and
360 feet east of the northwest corner of sec. 3, T. 1 N., R. 11 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 55 inches.

The A1 horizon is very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), or brown (10YR 4/3).  The texture is fine sandy loam or loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly to slightly acid.

The A2 horizon is dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), grayish brown
(10YR 5/2), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), brown (10YR 4/3, 5/3), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), or pale brown (10YR 6/3).  Mottles ranging from none to few are in shades of brown or gray.  The
texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.
Reaction ranges from very strongly to slightly acid.

The B21t horizon is strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), reddish brown (5YR
4/4, 5/4), or yellowish red (5YR 4/6, 5/6, 5/8).  Mottles are
present in shades of brown, red, or gray.  Reaction ranges from
very strongly acid to medium acid.

The B22t horizon is yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), strong brown (7.5YR
5/6, 5/8), yellowish red (5YR 4/6, 5/6, 4/8), or mottled in shades
of red, gray, or brown.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.

The B3 horizon, where present, is grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2; 10YR
5/2), light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4), brown (10YR 4/3), gray (10YR 6/1), yellowish brown (10YR 5/6, 5/8), strong brown (7.5YR 5/6),
or mottled in shades of gray, brown, red, or olive.  Reaction
ranges from strongly acid to mildly alkaline.

The C horizon is mottled in shades of red, brown, yellow, gray, or olive.  It is shaly clay or clayey shale with thin layers of sandstone.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bushnell, Counts, Enders, Tupelo, and Windthorst series.  Bushnell soils have mean annual soil temperature of more than 22 degrees C. (72 degrees F.).  Tupelo
soils lack an abrupt textural change between A and Bt horizons,
have less than 60 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon and are underlain by limestone.  Counts soils have sola thicker than 60 inches.  Windthorst soils are in a drier climate
and have less than 60 percent clay in the control section.  Enders soils have a base saturation of less than 35 percent at a depth of 1.25 mm (50 inches) below the argillic horizon or above the paralithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Homa soils are on crests and side slopes of dissected plateaus and mountains.  Slopes range from 2 to 45
percent.  Regolith is weathered shales with thin strata of hard
shale and/or sandstone.  Climate is moist, subhumid, or humid;
mean annual precipitation is about 40 to 46 inches; Thornthwaite annual P-E index is 64 to 76.  Mean annual temperature is 63
degrees F., at the type location.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Hector, Hartsells, and Linker series.  Hector soils are shallow to rock.  Hartsells
and Linker soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the control
section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Homa soils are moderately well
drained; medium to rapid runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly forested, but some is used for
pasture.  Native forest is of blackjack oak, postoak, hickory, and shortleaf pine with scattered understory of little bluestem and
other grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeast Oklahoma and westcentral Arkansas.  The series is extensive.
