HICO SERIES

The Hico series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy residuum from sandstone and siltstone of Cretaceous age. These soils occur on very gently sloping to moderately sloping backslopes of low ridges on hills. Slope are 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 in),and mean annual air temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).
