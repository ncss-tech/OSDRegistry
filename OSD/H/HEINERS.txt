HEINERS SERIES

The Heiners series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum,  colluvium and slope alluvium derived from sandstone, conglomerate and shale.  Heiners soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 4 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid, shallow Typic Haploxerepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Heiners gravelly loam, on a west facing convex, 7 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 7,250 feet.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on September 21, 1976, the soil was dry throughout.

    The surface is covered by 20 percent gravel.

    A1--0 to 3 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) dry; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; few fine vesicular pores; 20 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary (1 to 4 inches thick). 

    A2--3 to 8 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) dry; weak and moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary (3 to 7 inches thick).

    Bw--8 to 12 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) very gravelly loam, reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 35 percent sandstone gravel; strongly effervescent; carbonates are disseminated; strongly alkaline (pH 8.7); clear smooth boundary (4 to 6 inches thick).

    C--12 to 19 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) very gravelly loam, reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) dry; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 55 percent sandstone gravel; strongly effervescent; carbonates are disseminated; strongly alkaline (pH 8.7);  clear smooth boundary (0 to 8 inches thick).

    Cr--19 inches; weathering sandstone bedrock.

Depth to paralithic contact:  10 to 20 inches to weathered sandstone or shale

Particle-size control section:  15 to 22 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent rock fragments

A horizon:

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.  The Redcan series in a closely related family does not have a cambic horizon and is dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Heiners soils.
Parent material:  Residuum, colluvium and slope alluvium derived from sandstone, conglomerate and shale.
Landform:  Mountain slopes
Slopes:  4 to 70 percent
Elevation: 5,400 to 8,000 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  40 to 45 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  14 to 16 inches.
  Wettest months:  March through May
  Driest months:  July through September
Frost-free period:  70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Echocreek, Fewkes and Richsam series.  
  Echocreek:  Very deep soils on fan remnants along drainageways
  Fewkes:  Very deep soils on mountain slopes
  Richsum:  Deep soils on mountain slopes

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, low to high runoff, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The mail use is livestock grazing.  Vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, bluegrasses and bitterbrush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North Central Utah.  LRR E, MLRA 47.  This series is of moderate extent.
