HAIGLER SERIES

The Haigler series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in calcareous, stratified loamy and sandy alluvium on flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Oxyaquic Ustifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Haigler very fine sandy loam, with a 1 percent slope in rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

  A--0 to 5 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable; sodium adsorption ratio = 2; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)

  AC1--5 to 10 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; sodium adsorption ratio = 6; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.

  AC2--10 to 16 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; sodium adsorption ratio = 70; strongly effervescent; very strongly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the AC horizon ranges from 5 to 15 inches thick)

  C1--16 to 27 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; many thin strata of loam; massive; soft, very friable; sodium adsorption ratio = 124; strongly effervescent; very strongly alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

  C2--27 to 43 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loamy very fine sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; common coarse strata of fine sand; many medium faint light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) iron masses in the soil matrix; massive; soft, very friable; sodium adsorption ratio = 29; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.

  C3--43 to 80 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) fine sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; common coarse faint dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) iron masses in the soil matrix; single grain; loose; sodium adsorption ratio = 10; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:
Bosquecito (T) soils: have significant amounts of mica in the silt and sand fraction, receive peak precipitation in May and June, are not high in sodium in the particle-size control section
Kitcarson soils: are not high in sodium in the particle-size control section

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: river valleys
Landform: flood plains
Slopes: 0 to 2 percent
Elevation: 2500 to 3500 feet
Parent material: calcareous, stratified loamy and sandy alluvium
Mean annual air temperature: 51 to 53 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 14 to 18 inches
Frost-free period: 140 to 160 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Benkelman soils: are coarse-silty, on stream terraces
Bolent soils: have a seasonal high water table at 1.5 to 3.0 feet, lower on the landscape
Calamus soils: are sandy in the particle-size control section on similar positions on the landscape
Otero soils: do not have a seasonal high water table at less than 6 feet on stream terraces
Sanborn soils: have a seasonal high water table at 1.5 to 3.0 feet, lower on the landscape
 
DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage: Moderately well
Runoff:  low
Permeability:  moderate
Seasonal high water table: ranges from 3 to 6 feet
Flooding: rarely

USE AND VEGETATION: About one-half of this soil is used for cropland and the rest is used as rangeland.  Some areas of cropland are irrigated.  Corn, alfalfa and winter wheat are the main crops grown.  Major native grasses include alkali sacaton, inland saltgrass, western wheatgrass and blue grama.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwestern Nebraska, possibly northwestern Kansas, northeastern Colorado.
