HALFMOON SERIES

The Halfmoon series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in organic material and alluvium on floodplains. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 610 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 0.6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Euic Fluvaquentic Cryohemists

TYPICAL PEDON: Halfmoon mucky peat, located on a floodplain on a plain with a slope of 1 percent and elevation of 9 meters; when described on September 18th, 2008 the soil was wet throughout (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted)

 Oe--0 to 45 cm; mucky peat; many fine roots, common medium roots, few coarse roots, and many very fine roots; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear smooth boundary

 C--45 to 55 cm; very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) silt loam; 37 percent sand; 55 percent silt; 8 percent clay; massive; friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common fine roots, few medium roots, few coarse roots, and common very fine roots; moderately acid (pH 5.9); clear smooth boundary

 Ab--55 to 65 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) mucky silt loam; 25 percent sand; 65 percent silt; 10 percent clay; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common fine roots, few medium roots, few coarse roots, and common very fine roots; strongly acid (pH 5.5); clear smooth boundary

 Oi--65 to 183 cm; peat; common fine roots, few medium roots, few coarse roots, and common very fine roots; slightly acid (pH 6.3)
