HASKINS SERIES

The Haskins series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are moderately deep or deep to dense till. They formed in loamy water-sorted or glaciolacustrine material 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) thick and in the underlying till. These soils are on lake plains and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).

Lamberjack soils have more than 10 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Haskins soils are on lake plains and on till plains of late Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Haskins soils formed in loamy water-sorted material 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) thick and in the underlying till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 1067 mm (27 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 13 degrees C (45 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 200 days. Elevation is 183 to 386 meters (600 to 1300 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the somewhat poorly drained Aurand, very poorly drained Mermill, and moderately well drained Houcktown and Rawson soils that comprise a toposequence with the Haskins soils. Aurand soils have a mollic epipedon and are on similar landscape positions. Mermill soils are on flats or in depressions, and the Houcktown and Rawson soils are on higher landscape positions. The very poorly drained, clayey Hoytville and Latty soils are on nearby planar landscapes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm (0.5 to 1.5 feet) between November and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is low to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the loamy material and moderately low or low in the underlying till. Permeability is moderate in the loamy material and slow or very slow in the underlying till.

USE AND VEGETATION: A large proportion is under cultivation, primarily corn, soybeans, wheat, oats, and hay. Some areas are used for tomatoes and sugar beets. Native vegetation is deciduous, mixed hardwood forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 98, 99, 111B, 111C, and 139 in northwestern Ohio and northern Indiana; MLRA 110 in eastern Illinois. The type location is in MLRA 99. The series is of large extent, with about 200,000 acres.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Paulding County, Ohio, 1957.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 33 cm (Ap, BEg) horizon.
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 33 to 96 cm (Btg, Bt, B'tg horizons).
Densic contact: at 132 cm (top of the 2Cd horizon).
Aquic conditions: redox features in all horizons below a depth of 23 cm.

The previous Haskins series concept allowed for fine-textured lacustrine sediments in the 2B and 2Cd horizons. A new series will be established during modernization projects in MLRA 99 to define these soils.

An evaluation of existing lab data supports the redefinition of clay content in the till. Further evaluation for densic materials is needed to better define the series concept.

The addition of the densic contact is based on data from associated soils. More supporting bulk density data is needed.

The sandy surface phase correlated in an earlier survey does not meet the series concept. A new series will be established during modernization projects in MLRA 99 to define these soils.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Representative data mapunit is DMU ID 129997 in MO 11.
