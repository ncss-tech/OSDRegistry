HOUK SERIES



The Houk series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on

low terraces and bottomlands.  They formed in mixed alluvium weathered

from andesite, granite, rhyolite, and basalt.  Permeability is slow.

Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about

14 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Nettleton series.  Nettleton soils lack

lime and are strongly to medium acid.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Houk soils are on low terraces and bottomlands and

have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium weathered

from andesite, granite, rhyolite, quartzite and some basalt.

Elevations are 4,800 to 5,500 feet.  Average annual precipitation is 12

to 16 inches.  Average January temperature is 15 degrees F; average

July temperature is 66 degrees F; and average annual temperature is 39

to 45 degrees F.  Frost-free period is about 65 to 100 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brinegar, Marshdale,

Strom, and Vodermaier soils.  Brinegar soils are moderately well

drained and lack an E horizon.  Marshdale soils are poorly drained and

lack a Bt horizon.  Strom soils lack an E horizon.  Vodermaier soils

are well drained, lack a Bt horizon and are sandy.  Vodermaier soils

are on high terraces.  The other associated soils are on landscape

positions similar to Houk soils.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; very slow runoff;

slow permeability; frequent overflow in the spring.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for pasture, dry cropland, and some

irrigated cropland.  Crops are small grain and hay.  Vegetation is

silver sagebrush, foxtail barley, water tolerant grasses, common camas

and willows.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern and south-central Idaho.  The

soils are moderately extensive.
