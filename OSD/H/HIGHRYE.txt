HIGHRYE SERIES 

The Highrye series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in granitic colluvium and residuum on bedrock controlled slopes in foothills and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.

TYPE LOCATION: Silver Bow County, Montana; approximately 500 feet south and 700 feet east of the NW corner of sec. 22, T 3 N., R 7 W. Elk Park Pass topographic quadrangle, UTM zone 12, NAD 27, 0386723 east, 5095156 north.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Mean annual soil temperature - 36 to 42 degrees F., cryic temperature regime.
Soil moisture control section - between 4 and 12  inches; dry in some or all parts for 90 or more cumulative days in normal years; not dry in all parts for more than half of the cumulative days. Ustic moisture regime. 
Mollic epipedon thickness - 7 to 15 inches, mixed.
Depth to coarse sandy substrates - 20 to 56 inches, with no strongly contrasting particle-size classes.
Depth to paralithic contact - 40 to 60 inches.
These soils contain a high proportion of medium, coarse, and very coarse angular sand in the sand fraction due to granitic parent materials.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Accola, Amsden, Barbarella, Cific, Coldspring, Croftshaw, Dewville, Gelkie, Hooligan, Inchau, Kezar, Leavitt, Lucky, Lymanson, Madigan, Michelson, Miracle, Monaberg, Morset, Oro Fino, Passcreek, Philipsburg, Rainbolt, Tripit, Wellsville, Woosley, Youga, and Zade series.  The Accola, Amsden, Dewville, Gelkie, Leavitt, Madigan, Michelson, Morset, Oro Fino, Philipsburg, and Wellsville soils are calcareous above 40 inches. The Barbarella, Cific, Hooligan, Inchau, Kezar, Lucky, Lymanson, Miracle, Passcreek, Rainbolt, Tripit, Woosley, and Zade soils have bedrock between 20 to 40 inches.  The Coldspring, Croftshaw, Monaberg, and Youga soils lack one or more horizons of loamy coarse sand or coarse sand above 60 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform - Hill or mountain slopes, pediments, ridges 
Elevation - 5,150 to 7,570 feet. 
Slope - 2 to 45 percent. 
Parent material - granitic colluvium and residuum. 
Climate - long, cold winters; cool, moist springs; cool, dry summers. 
Mean annual precipitation - 15 to 19 inches. 
Mean annual air temperature - 34 to 40 degrees F. 
Frost-free period - 30 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
These are the Branham and Zonite series. The Branham soils lack an argillic horizon, have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches and occur more on sideslope landform positions.  Zonite soils are very shallow to bedrock and occur mainly on shoulder and summit landform positions or adjacent to granite outcrops.
                                            
DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate permeability above the BC horizon and moderately rapid to rapid in the BC and C horizons.

USE AND VEGETATION: Highrye soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, Nelson's needlegrass, rubber rabbitbrush, rough fescue, Idaho fescue, silvery lupine and other miscellaneous forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Highrye soils are not extensive in the mountains and foothills of southwestern Montana.
