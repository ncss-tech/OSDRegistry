HAPUNA SERIES

The Hapuna series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in basic volcanic ash in `a`a lava. Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent. The mean annual rainfall is about 200 millimeters (8 inches) and the mean annual temperature about 23 degrees C (73 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Medial-skeletal, amorphic, isohyperthermic Petrocalcic Duritorrands

TYPICAL PEDON: Hapuna extremely cobbly medial silt loam, on a west facing, slightly convex, 2 percent slope, under grasses and kiawe shrubs, at an elevation of 165 meters (540 feet).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. Similar soils include Lalamilo and Waikui series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hapuna soils are on low elevation, leeward slopes on Mauna Kea Volcano and Kohala Mountain at elevations from sea level to 610 meters (0 to 2,000 feet). The soils are on summit positions of undulating to hilly `a`a flows that are 65,000 to 250,000 years old. Slope gradients range from 2 to 20 percent. The soils formed in basic volcanic ash in `a`a lava. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 178 to 510 millimeters (7 to 20 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 2,286 to 2,540 meters (90 to 100 inches).  The mean annual temperature ranges from 21 to 24 degrees C (70 to 75 degrees F). The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kiholo, Lalamilo, Puako and Waikui series. Kiholo soils have a lithic contact at 5 to 50 centimeters (2 to 20 inches). Lalamilo soils are not skeletal. Puako soils are alluvial soils with coarse loamy texture in the control section. Waikui soils do not have a petrocalcic horizon. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Runoff is high to very high. Permeability is rapid in the soil and very slow in the petrocalcic horizon. Hydrophobic conditions in the surface can reduce infiltration.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat and building site development. Vegetation is buffelgrass (Cenchrus ciliaris) and Kiawe (Prosopis pallida).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South Kohala District, Island of Hawaii; MLRA 157. The series is of small extent.
