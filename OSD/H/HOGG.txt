HOGG SERIES

The Hogg series consists of deep, well-drained soils that formed in cherty limestone, shale and sandstone.  These soils are on uplands with slopes of 0 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Typic Paleustalfs 
TYPICAL PEDON:  Hogg fine sandy loam, forested. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 inches, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak thick platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many fine and medium tubular and common very fine pores; approximately 5 percent gravel; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 3 inches thick)

    Bt1--3 to 8 inches, brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common moderately thick clay films on peds and in pores; few stones; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt2--8 to 20 inches, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium and coarse angular and subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, sticky and very plastic; few fine, medium and coarse roots; common very fine and few fine tubular pores; many moderately thick clay films on peds and in pores; few stones; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear irregular boundary (5 to 14 inches thick)

    Bt3--20 to 29 inches, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) stony clay, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, sticky and very plastic; few fine and medium roots; few and fine tubular pores; many moderately thick clay films on peds and in pores; approximately 20 percent stones; noneffervescent; few limestone fragments; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear irregular boundary (4 to 13 inches thick)

    Bt4--29 to 52 inches, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) gravelly clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; many large prominent pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) mottles, reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) moist; weak fine prismatic structure that parts to moderate fine angular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and very plastic; few fine and medium roots; few very fine pores; few moderately thick clay films on peds; approximately 15 percent gravel and 10 percent stones; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 24 inches thick)

    R--52 to 54 inches, white (N/8 ) extremely hard limestone bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION: Coconino County, Arizona; SW1/4 sec. 4, T.14N., R.11E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Soil is intermittently moist in some part of the moisture control section during Dec.- Feb. and July - Sept. Typic ustic moisture regime.

Soil Temperature - Mean annual soil temperature is less than 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is less than 59 degrees F.

Solum thickness - Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.

O1 horizon is present in some pedons.

A horizon
Hue:  7.5YR, 10YR
Value:  4 or 5 dry
Chroma:  2 or 3
Texture:  Fine sandy loam, stony fine sandy loam, or stony silt loam

Bt horizon
Hue:  5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR
Value:  3 to 5 dry, 4 or less moist
Chroma:  2 to 6
Texture:  Clay loam, clay, gravelly clay, or stony clay.  Clay is more than 35 percent
Some pedons have few calcium carbonate accumulations in the lower part of the Bt horizon.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Dunton (CO), Mirand (NM), and Soldier (AZ) series.  Dunton soils are moderately deep to sandstone. Mirand soils are neutral throughout the profile. Soldier soils are slightly acid through strongly acid. 
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hogg soils are on uplands with slopes of 0 to 25 percent.  Elevation ranges from 6,500 feet to 8,200 feet.  These soils formed from cherty limestone, sandstone, and shale.  The average annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches with a mean annual temperature of about 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 80 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Brolliar, Showlow and Wilcoxson soils and the McVickers and Tortugas soils.  McVickers soils have distinct A2 horizons and montmorillonitic mineralogy.  Totugas soils are shallow to bedrock and have over 50 percent coarse fragments.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well-drained; medium runoff; slow and very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for timber, water and wildlife production and summer grazing of livestock.  Native vegetation is an open stand of Ponderosa pine and Gambel oak, alligator juniper and pinyon pine, with an understory of pine dropseed, mountain muhly, squirreltail and Arizona fescue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Coconino County and north-central Yavapai County, Arizona, and north central New Mexico and possibly other sections in northern Arizona at high elevations.  The series is inextensive. MLRAs 39 & 48A.
