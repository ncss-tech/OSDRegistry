HASKILLPASS SERIES 

The Haskillpass series consists of very deep, well drained soils on moraines. They formed in till with minor amounts of volcanic ash mixed in the surface layers. Permeability is moderate. Slopes are 2 to 35 percent. The average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is about 17 inches.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Macabre series. The Macabre series consists of soils that are moderately deep to a paralithic contact of welded tuff. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform  moraines.
Elevation  3400 to 4200 feet. 
Slope - 2 to 35 percent. 
Parent material  volcanic ash over till.
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm, dry summers. 
Mean annual precipitation  15 to 24 inches, much of which falls as snow and spring rain. 
Mean annual air temperature - 40 to 46 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Finleypoint, Prospect, and Yeoman soils. Finleypoint soils do not have argillic horizons and are on moraines. Prospect soils are fine-loamy and are on moraines. Yeoman soils are fine-loamy and pachic and are on moraines.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Haskillpass soils are used for rangeland, wildlife habitat, and watershed. The native vegetation is Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, prairie junegrass, Richardson needlegrass, western yarrow, lupine, and sticky geranium.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Haskillpass soils are of small extent in northwest Montana. MLRA 43A and 44A.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES PROPOSED: Flathead County, Montana, 2005. The name is coined from Haskill Pass in Flathead County, Montana.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

Mollic epipedon - 0 to 12 inches (A and AB horizons)
Albic horizon  - 18 to 29 inches (2E horizon)
Argillic horizon - 29 to 43 inches (2Bt horizon) 
Particle-size control section  - 29 to 43 inches (2Bt horizon)
