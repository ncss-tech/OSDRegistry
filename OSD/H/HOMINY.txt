HOMINY SERIES

The Hominy series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from quartzite and sedimentary rocks.  Hominy soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Sandy-skeletal, siliceous, mesic Ustic Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hominy very cobbly loamy sand, on a southeast facing, 2 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 6,200 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    The surface is covered by 20 percent gravel, cobbles, and stones.

    A1--0 to 2 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) very cobbly loamy sand, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak medium platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; 20 percent of the surface covered with gravel, cobbles and stones; 5 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones in the horizon; very slightly effervescent, (1 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary.

    A2--2 to 9 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely cobbly sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, few fine and medium roots; common very fine, few fine tubular pores; 30 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; very slightly effervescent, (1 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.

(7 to 12 inches thick)

    Bw2--16 to 28 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/6) extremely cobbly sand, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; single grain; loose, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, few fine and medium roots; few fine tubular pores; 40 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; matrix is noneffervescent with few faint coatings of calcium carbonate on the lower surfaces of rock fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 12 inches thick)

    Bk1--28 to 41 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) extremely cobbly sand, yellowish red (5YR 5/6) moist; single grain; loose, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few fine tubular pores; 35 percent gravel; 30 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones; matrix is noneffervescent with common faint coatings of calcium carbonate on the lower surfaces of rock fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary.

    Bk2--41 to 60 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) extremely cobbly sand, yellowish red (5YR 5/6) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine tubular pores; 45 percent gravel and 30 percent cobbles; matrix is noneffervescent with common faint coatings of calcium carbonate on the lower surfaces of rock fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).  (combined thickness is 32 to 50 inches)

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  alluvium derived from quartzite and sedimentary rocks
Landform:  fan remnants
Slopes:  1 to 3 percent
Elevation: 5,300 to 6,800 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  45 to 49 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  8 to 12 inches
Frost-free period:  110 to 140 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ardlon, Heapo, Robido, Uver, and Wonsits series.

Ardlon, Robido, and Wonsits soils have mollic epipedons.

Heapo soils have an irrigation induced water table.

Uver soils have an irregular decrease of organic carbon and are flooded.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained, very low runoff, moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major uses are rangeland, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  Potential native vegetation consists of Wyoming big sagebrush, Indian ricegrass, needleandthread and galleta.  These soils are correlated to Semidesert Gravelly Sandy Loam (Wyoming Big Sagebrush) - 034XY205UT range sites in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeast Utah.  LRR D, MLRA 34.  This series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Uintah County, Uintah Area Soil Survey, Utah. 1998.  The name is taken from a nearby geographic name.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (Bw1, Bw2, and Bk1 horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 9 inches.  (A1 and A2 horizons)
Cambic horizon:  The zone from 9 to 28 inches.  (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)

The surface texture modifier was determined following the guidelines outlined in the Utah document, "Procedures for Distributing Rock Fragments on the Surface Layer into the Upper 6 inches of Soil and Subsequent Naming of Map Units, April 1979."

The cation exchange activity class was inferred from laboratory data from similar soils in the Uintah Area Soil Survey.

Taxonomic version:  Eighth Edition, 1998.
