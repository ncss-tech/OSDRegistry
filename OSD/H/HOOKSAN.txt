Thickness of the Underlying Material: Greater than 182 centimeters (72 inches)
Depth to Bedrock: Greater than 150 centimeters (60 inches)
Depth to Seasonal High Water Table: Greater than 182 centimeters (72 inches)
Rock Fragments: 0 to 5 percent, by volume throughout the profile, mostly shells. Some pedons may contain individual layers lees 30 centimeters (1 foot) thick with up to 10 percent fragments.
Soil Reaction: Strongly acid to slightly alkaline A or AC horizon and moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the C horizon

O horizon (if it occurs):
Color--hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, chroma of 1 to 3
Texture--highly decomposed to slightly decomposed plant material

A horizon:
Color--hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 7, chroma of 1 or 2
Texture--fine sand, sand, or coarse sand

AC horizon (if it occurs):
Color--hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, chroma of 1 or 2
Texture-fine sand, sand, or coarse sand

C horizon (upper part):
Color--hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, chroma of 3 to 8
Texture-fine sand, sand, or coarse sand

C horizon (lower part):
Color--hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 8, chroma of 1 to 8
Texture-fine sand, sand, or coarse sand. Some pedons have common .5 to 1 centimeter (0.25 to 0.5 inch) thick, roughly horizontal bands, with high proportion of dark minerals.

COMPETING SERIES:
Boone soils--are moderately deep to paralithic contact and are underlain by weathered sandstone
Carver soils--have a B horizon and formed in outwash plains and moraines
Tarr soils--have a B horizon and formed in alluvium derived from sandy siliceous sandstone
Tint soils--moderately well drained and have redoximorphic features within 182 centimeters (72 inches), commonly within 100 centimeters (40 inches)

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: Coastal plain, coastal lowlands, and barrier islands
Landform: Dunes commonly adjoining coastal beaches
Elevation: 0 to 15 meters (0 to 50 feet)
Parent Material: Eolian sands derived from sandy marine deposits
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 8 to 14 degrees Celsius (46 to 58 degrees F).
Mean Annual Precipitation: 1066 to 1289 millimeters (42 to 51 inches)
Frost Free Period: 150 to 210 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Carver soils--have a B horizon of loamy coarse sand or coarser material and formed in glacial outwash, on adjacent landforms
Downer soils--well drained and have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section, on higher landforms
Eastchop soils--have a B horizon and formed in glacial outwash, on adjacent landforms
Evesboro soils--have a B horizon and contain more silt and clay in the particle-size control section, on higher landforms
Matunuck soils--have 20 to 40 cm of organic soil materials in the upper part, on adjacent tidal marshes
Pawcatuck soils--have greater than 40 cm of organic soil material in the upper part, on adjacent tidal marshes
Plymouth soils--have a B horizon and formed in glacial outwash or deltaic deposits, on adjacent landforms
Sandyhook soils--very poorly drained and tidally flooded, on adjacent tidal marshes and other low-lying landforms
Succotash--moderately well drained, on base slopes of dunes, dune slacks, and on adjacent landforms (back barriers of barrier islands and spits)

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage Class: Excessively drained
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: Very high
Permeability (Obsolete): Very rapid
Rare very brief coastal flooding may occur during major storms and wash over events.  

USE AND VEGETATION:
Use: Most of these soils are used for ecological services (e.g., mitigation of coastal erosion and flooding), recreation, urban development, beach cottages, and wildlife
Native vegetation consists of beach grasses, poison ivy, beach plum, American holly, red cedar, black cherry, smooth sumac, green briar, and prickly pear cactus.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Distribution: Mainly bordering the North Atlantic Coast in Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Maine.
Extent: Moderate

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Monmouth County, New Jersey; 1983

REMARKS: Hooksan soils were previously mapped as Fripp, Udipsamments, Coastal Beach, or Dune land. The Hooksan series was previously classified as siliceous, uncoated Typic Udipsamments.

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 6 inches (A horizon)

The 9/2011 revision adds Rhode Island to the states using the series and adds saturated hydraulic conductivity class.

The 2/2017 revision removes Hammonton and Klej as geographically associated and adds Matunuck, Pawcatuck, Sandyhook, and Succotash.  Hammonton and Klej are on the mainland and not associated with barrier island and dune systems.  Connecticut and Maine added to the states using the series.
