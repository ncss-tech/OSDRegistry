HOIST SERIES

The Hoist series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are deep to dense till. Hoist soils are formed in till and are on ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 7.2 degrees C (45 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, semiactive, frigid Oxyaquic Glossudalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Hoist sandy loam, on a 9 percent slope in a cultivated area. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 23 cm (9 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) sandy loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine roots; about 5 percent gravel and 2 percent cobbles; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [13 to 25 cm (5 to 10 inches) thick]

 Bw--23 to 36 cm (9 to 14 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine roots; about 5 percent gravel and 2 percent cobbles; neutral; clear wavy boundary. [8 to 20 cm (3 to 8 inches) thick]

 E/B--36 to 53 cm (14 to 21 inches); brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy loam (E); occupies about 60 percent of the horizon as tongues extending into and surrounding peds of reddish brown (5YR 4/4) sandy loam (Bt); moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine roots; about 5 percent gravel and 2 percent cobbles; neutral; clear wavy boundary. [5 to 20 cm (2 to 8 inches) thick]

 Bt1--53 to 69 cm (21 to 27 inches); reddish brown (5YR 4/4) loam; strong medium subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots between peds; common faint dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) clay films on faces of peds; about 2 percent gravel and 2 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary.

 Bt2--69 to 124 cm (27 to 49 inches); light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) sandy loam; weak thick platy structure; firm; few fine roots between peds; common very fine vesicular pores; few distinct reddish brown (5YR 5/4) clay films on vertical faces of peds; common medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; about 7 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 51 to 76 cm (20 to 30 inches).]

 Cd--124 to 203 cm (49 to 80 inches); light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) sandy loam; massive; weakly expressed plates inherited from the parent material; very firm; about 7 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hoist soils are on ground moraines of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent. These soils formed in till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 813 mm (28 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 to 8.3 degrees C (43 to 47 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Klacking soils. The Klacking soils are well drained and formed in stratified outwash material. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 76 to 107 cm (2.5 to 3.5 feet) between November and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the upper part, moderately high in the middle part, and low in the dense till substratum. Permeability is moderately rapid in the upper part, moderately slow in the middle part, and very slow in the lower part. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of this soil is used for growing grains and hay. A small portion is in woodland. Tree species include sugar maple, white ash and American basswood.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 94A in the northeast quarter of the lower peninsula of Michigan. The series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Alcona County, Michigan, 1992.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 23 cm (9 inches) (Ap horizon).
Cambic horizon: from a depth of 23 to 36 cm (9 to 14 inches) (Bw horizon).
Glossic horizon: from a depth of 36 to 53 cm (14 to 21 inches) (E/B horizon).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 53 to 124 cm (21 to 49 inches) (Bt horizon).
Densic contact: at 124 cm (49 inches) (top of the Cd horizon).

The Hoist soils were mapped as Emmet soils prior to 1988. They depart from the concept of Emmet soils by having a glossic horizon and by forming in dense basal till.

The well drained phase is no longer in the concept of this series. This will become a new series.
