(3 to 25 cm thick)

TYPE LOCATION: Charles County, Maryland; from the intersection of Billingsley Road and Saint Charles Parkway in Saint Charles, Maryland, 3700 feet South on Saint Charles Parkway; 1000 feet Southwest on dirt road to gas line right-of-way; 1290 feet South-Southeast on gas line right-of-way; 250 feet northeast into woods. USGS La Plata, MD topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 34 minutes 16.3 seconds N and longitude 76 degrees 55 minutes 20.1 seconds W, NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Solum thickness: 25 (10 inches) to 183 cm (72 inches) or more 
Depth to Bedrock: greater than 183 cm (72 inches)
Depth to Seasonal High Water Table: greater than 183 cm (72 inches), January to December
Depth to Lithologic Discontinuity: Some pedons have a lithologic discontinuity below 152 cm (60 inches) which consists of loamy material from older geologic formations
Rock Fragment content: 0 to 45 percent, by volume, in the A or Ap horizon; 0 to 90 percent in individual subsurface horizons. Some horizon below the A has more than 50 percent gravel, and the weighted average of the zone from 25 to 102 cm (10 to 40 inches) exceeds 35 percent gravel. 
Soil Reaction: Very strongly acid to extremely acid, except where limed
Other features: Some pedons lack a Bw horizon based on color and have an A-C profile. 

RANGE OF INDIVIDUAL HORIZONS: 
A or Ap horizon:
Color--hue of 2.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5 and chroma of 1 to 4. 
Texture (fine-earth fraction)--sand, fine sand, or loamy sand 

E or BE horizon (if it occurs):
Color--hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 8.
Texture (fine-earth fraction)--sand, fine sand, or loamy sand 

Bw horizon (if it occurs):
Color--hue of 7.5 YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 8.
Texture (fine-earth fraction)--coarse sand, sand, or loamy sand 

BC horizon (if it occurs):
Color--hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.
Texture (fine-earth fraction)--coarse sand, sand, fine sand, or loamy sand.
Other features--Clay depletions in shades of yellow, pale yellow, or pale olive may be present 

C horizon (if it occurs):
Color--hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 8, or is neutral.
Texture (fine-earth fraction)--coarse sand, sand, loamy coarse sand, or loamy sand. Thin discontinuous strata of loamier material are present in some pedons. 

COMPETING SERIES:
