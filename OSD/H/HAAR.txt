HAAR SERIES

The Haar series consists of very shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum on eroded side slopes of dissected pediments.  These soils formed in residuum from Tertiary sediments.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 10 degrees C. and mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, nonacid, mesic, shallow Xeric Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:   Haar gravelly loam, rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)The soil surface is covered with 30 percent gravel.

    A--0 to 5 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium and fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 30 percent gravel, slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 10 cm thick)

    C--5 to 15 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) extremely para gravelly silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few coarse, common medium and fine, and many very fine roots, many fine and very fine interstitial pores; 80 percent gravel size fragments of soft siltstone; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 23 cm thick)

    Cr--15 cm; fractured layered sandstone, mudstone, and siltstone with a hardness of less than 3.  Root mats are in the fractures.

TYPE LOCATION:   Lyon County, Nevada; l/2 mile northwest of the top of Aldrich Grade; 450 feet east of the southwest corner of section l, T. 7 N., R. 27 E.; USGS Ninemile Ranch 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 29 minutes 17 seconds N and longitude 118 degrees 55 minutes 23 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.4880556 latitude, -118.9227778 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: These soils are usually dry.  They are moist from late fall to early spring; aridic soil moisture bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 11 to 14 degrees C.
Depth to paralithic contact: 10 to 25 cm.
Reaction:  Neutral through moderately alkaline.

Particle-size control section - Percent clay:  l0 to l8 percent.
Rock fragments:  50 to 90 percent gravel size, soft mudstone, siltstone and sandstone.  Most fragments slake in water or crush easily when wet.

A horizon 
Hue:  2.5Y or l0YR.
Value:  6 through 8 dry; 3 through 6 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Structure:  Granular or platy.
Rock fragments:  Up to 30 percent hard rock fragments from higher geologic formations.

C horizon (where present) 
Hue:  2.5Y or l0YR.
Value:  6 or 7 dry; 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Texture:  Sandy loam, loam or silt loam modified by parafragments.
Structure:  Massive or subangular blocky.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Boondock, Budihol and Nicanor series.  

Boondock soils average 18 to 30 percent clay and 5 to 15 percent rock fragments. Budihol soils have l5 to 35 percent hard gravel in the particle-size control section and have hard bedrock at a depth of 50 to 76 cm.  Nicanor soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 50 to 100 cm and a control section with l8 to 27 percent clay and l5 to 35 percent hard pebbles

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Haar soils are on sides of dissected Tertiary pediments with convex slopes of 8 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,524 to 1,982 meters.  These soils formed in residuum from soft Tertiary sedimentary bedrock.  The mean annual temperature is about 9 to 12 degrees C. and the mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm.  The frost-free season is l00 to l20 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:   This is the Ravenell series.  Ravenell soils have an argillic horizon and are on stable surfaces.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:   Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; moderate permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  The bedrock takes in water at varying rates depending on the angle of bedding, hardness, and composition.

USE AND VEGETATION:   Rangeland, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  Native vegetation is a very spares Utah juniper and singleleaf pinyon stand with desert needlegrass, Indian ricegrass, Wyoming big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, and Anderson peachbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  The soils are not extensive. MLRA 26.
