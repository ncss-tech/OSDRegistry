HENKLE SERIES

The Henkle series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils on volcanic uplands.  They formed in ash and colluvium over bedrock.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-skeletal, glassy, frigid Lithic Vitrixerands

TYPICAL PEDON:  Henkle very cobbly ashy sandy loam - rangeland, on a 15 percent northeast facing slope at 3160 feet elevation.  (When described (8/20/85), the soil was dry throughout.  Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 1 inch; slightly decomposed litter of ponderosa pine and western juniper needles and twigs.

    A1--1 to 3 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) very cobbly ashy sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) dry; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; 15 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary.

    A2--3 to 18 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) very cobbly ashy sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine irregular pores; 15 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt irregular boundary.  (Combined thickness of the A horizon is 10 to 20 inches)

   2R--18 inches; fractured basalt; common distinct clay films on fracture faces, basalt fragments have a 1-2 mm weathering rind.

TYPE LOCATION:  Deschutes County, Oregon; on northeast slope of Henkle Butte, northwest quarter of the southeast quarter of section 24, T. 14 S., R. 10 E. (Latitude 44 degrees, 20 minutes, 27 seconds N, Longitude 121 degrees, 28 minutes, 49 seconds W)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are intermittently moist and are dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section for 90 to 110 consecutive days.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 44 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 10 to 20 inches.  The solum contains 50 to 80 percent volcanic glass and glass-coated aggregates.  Reaction is neutral throughout.  Phosphate retention is 40 to 70 percent.  The acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate extractable iron is 0.40 to 1.0 percent.  Field estimated clay content is 5 to 20 percent throughout.  Reaction is neutral in the upper part and neutral to slightly alkaline in the lower part.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.  It contains 0 to 35 percent gravel, 0 to 60 percent cobbles and 0 to 20 percent stones.  It contains a total of 15 to 80 percent rock fragments.  The fine-earth texture is ashy sandy loam, ashy fine sandy loam, ashy loam or ashy loamy sand.  Organic matter content is typically less than 1 percent below a depth of 12 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 12 inches thick.

Some pedons have a Bw horizon, when present, has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.  It has 40 to 75 percent rock fragments of which 5 to 20 are gravel, 5 to 10 percent cobbles, 5 to 30 percent stones and 15 to 45 percent boulders.  The fine-earth texture is ashy loam, or ashy sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.

The C horizon, when present, has chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  The fine-earth texture is ashy loamy sand or ashy loamy coarse sand and contains 0 to 10 percent stones, and 50 to 70 percent cobbles.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Pepoon and Treemold series.  Pepoon soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days.  Treemold soils have an ochric epipedon and are very shallow.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Henkle soils are on volcanic uplands including hillslopes, and mountain slopes.  Elevations are 2,800 to 5,900 feet.  These soils formed in volcanic ash and colluvium over bedrock.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and hot, dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 20 inches, falling mostly as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 20 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Fremkle, Fryrear, Laidlaw, Lundgren, Sisters, Wanoga, and Yapoah soils.  These soils all have bedrock deeper than 20 inches except Fremkle which has less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapid or rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, recreation.  Potential native vegetation is western juniper, ponderosa pine, antelope bitterbrush, mountain big sagebrush, and Idaho fescue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Footslopes and plateaus of the eastern Cascades in central Oregon; MLRA 6.  The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Deschutes County (Upper Deschutes River Area), Oregon, 1992.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features in the pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - from 1 to 12 inches (A1, and part of the A2 horizon)

Andic soil properties - Based on laboratory data from the associated Wanoga Series; S860R-017-001.  P-retention is about 60 percent.  The glass and glass-coated aggregate in the very fine sand fraction is about 70 percent.  Acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron is about 0.45 percent.  The 15-bar water on both dried and undried samples is less than 10 percent.

Ash deposit is from Mt. Mazama.
