HART SERIES

The Hart series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium over residuum derived from basalt and tuff.  Hart soils are on rock pediments on plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, smectitic, frigid Duric Palexerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hart very gravelly loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    4R--43 inches; fractured tuff; opaline silica and calcium carbonate line widely-spaced fractures.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lake County, Oregon; between Deppy Creek and McDowell Creek and east of the powerline; in the NE 1/4, of the NW 1/4, of the SE 1/4 of section 1, T. 37 S., R. 22 E.; USGS Drake Peak NE 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; approximately 42 degrees 23 minutes 15 seconds north latitude and 120 degrees 04 minutes 01 seconds west longitude, NAD27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - These soils are dry for more than half the time when the soil temperature is greater than 41 degrees F.  The soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. from about March 15 to November 15; aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric.

Mean annual soil temperature - 45 to 47 degrees F.

Mollic epipedon thickness - 7 to 12 inches; does not include the 2Bt horizon.

Depth to base of argillic horizon - 15 to 30 inches.

Depth to horizons with secondary carbonates - 15 to 30 inches.

Depth to horizon with firm, brittle consistence or durinodes - 30 to 40 inches.

Depth to bedrock - 40 to 60 inches to a lithic contact.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 45 to 55 percent; Rock fragments: 5 to 25 percent, mainly fine gravel.  Lithology of fragments are volcanic rocks such as basalt and tuff.

Other features - An abrupt horizon boundary is normally present between the A and the 2Bt horizon accompanied by an abrupt increase in clay content of 20 to 40 percent.

Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Texture: Extremely cobbly loam or very gravelly loam.
Clay content: 15 to 25 percent.
Rock fragments: 10 to 50 percent gravel, 5 to 50 percent cobbles.

Clay content: 15 to 25 percent.
Rock fragments: 30 to 60 percent gravel, 5 to 10 percent cobbles.
Consistence: Firm or very firm and brittle when moist due to opaline silica.
Durinodes: Some pedons have 20 to 50 percent durinodes.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hart soils are on rock pediments on plateaus.  These soils formed in alluvium over residuum derived from basalt and tuff.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 5,300 to 6,500 feet.  The climate is semiarid and characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, the mean annual temperature is 43 to 46 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 50 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Mascamp, Newlands, and Ninemile soils.  Mascamp soils are loamy-skeletal and are shallow to lithic contacts.  Newlands soils are fine-loamy and have a cryic temperature regime.  Ninemile soils are shallow to lithic contacts.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very high surface runoff; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Hart soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is low sagebrush, Idaho fescue, and bluebunch wheatgrass.  In areas with an A horizon less than 7 inches thick, the plant community is mainly black sagebrush, Sandberg's bluegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Oregon.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 23.
