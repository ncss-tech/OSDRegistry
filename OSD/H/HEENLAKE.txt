HEENLAKE SERIES

The Heenlake series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from tuff, tuff-breccia, and andesite.  Heenlake soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 500 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually moist in the moisture control section during late fall, winter, and spring; dry from July through early October for 75 to 90 consecutive days in the four months following the summer solstice; xeric moisture regime that borders on aridic.
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 25 to 50 cm; includes the Bt1 and Bt2 horizons.
Depth to base of argillic horizon: 50 to 100 cm.
Depth to bedrock: 50 to 100 cm to a paralithic contact.  The paralithic materials below the contact are weathered volcanic rocks such as andesitic tuff.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Clanalpine, Devaul, Elaero, Glidski, Heechee, Holmes, Horrocks, Hoskin, Howcan, Longday, Pequop, Moreypeak, Suak, Valmar, Vitale, and Wambolt series.

Clanalpine soils typically have mollic epipedons that do not include the Bt horizons and are dominated by cobbles in the particle-size control section.  Devaul soils are deep to paralithic contacts.  Elaero soils average 12 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section, have rock fragments that are granitic rocks, and have paralithic material of weathered granitic rock in the series control section. Glidski, Heechee, Holmes, Howcan, Longday, Pequop, and Wambolt soils are very deep.  Horrocks soils are deep to lithic contacts.  Hoskin, Suak, Valmar, and Vitale soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Moreypeak soils average 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Heenlake soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on footslope and backslope positions.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from tuff, tuff-breccia, and andesite.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,650 to 2,655 meters.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 600 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 40 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Celeridge, Chenhigh, and Joecut soils.  Celeridge and Chenhigh soils have lithic contacts within 50 cm.  Joecut soils are very deep and have umbric epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high or very high surface runoff; moderately slow permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Heenlake soils are used for livestock grazing, recreation, watershed, and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, and western needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern California, on the east side of the Sierra Nevada Range.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRAs 22A and 26.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 46 cm (A, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons).
Argillic horizon - The zone from 15 to 56 cm (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).
Paralithic contact - The boundary at 56 cm to underlying soft bedrock (Cr layer).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 15 to 56 cm (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).

The revision of October 2003 updated the taxonomic class from Loamy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Typic Argixerolls.  The isotic mineralogy class was based solely on the field determined values for sodium fluoride pH.  Laboratory data on 15 bar water to clay ratio does not exist to verify the isotic mineralogy class.
