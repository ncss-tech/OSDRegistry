HANNAROCKS SERIES

The Hannarocks series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from granitic sources. Hannarocks soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes range from 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 750 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 8.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Pachic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hannarocks extremely cobbly loam, on an east facing, linear, 38 percent slope under Jeffrey pine, white fir, California black oak, and annual grasses at an elevation of 2,341 meters. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The surface is covered by approximately 10 percent gravel, 35 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones. 

    A -- 0 to 30 centimeters; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) extremely cobbly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, firm, slightly sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine roots throughout; 30 percent gravel, 35 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual smooth boundary.  (15 to 35 centimeters)

    Bw1 -- 30 to 61 centimeters; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) extremely cobbly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, firm, slightly sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine roots throughout; 30 percent gravel, 35 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual smooth boundary.

    Bw2 -- 61 to 97 centimeters; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) extremely cobbly loam, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, firm, slightly sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine roots throughout; 30 percent gravel, 35 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bw horizon is 15 to 85 centimeters)

    Crt -- 97 to 104 centimeters; moderately cemented granitoid rock; common fine roots in cracks; 3 percent patchy distinct clay films on rock faces; moderately acid (pH 5.6).
