HOLTER SERIES

The Holter series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from igneous, argillite, or fine grained sedimentary rock.  These soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 3 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Holter channery loam, grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A1--0 to 8 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) channery loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very thin platy structure parting to moderate very fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 20 percent channers; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear smooth boundary. 

    A2--8 to 12 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very channery loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 55 percent channers; moderately acid (pH 5.8); gradual smooth boundary. (combined thickness of A horizons is 7 to 16 inches thick)

    Bt1--12 to 28 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely channery clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 65 percent channers; slightly acid (pH 6.1); gradual smooth boundary.

    Bt2--28 to 42 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely channery clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and bridging sand grains; 65 percent channers; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary (8 to 18 inches). (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 15 to 35 inches.)

    Bk--42 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely channery loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots to 50 inches and few very fine roots below; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 60 percent channers, 5 percent flagstones; continuous faint lime casts on undersides of fragments; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4).

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lewis and Clark County Area, Montana, 1991; proposed in Lewis and Clark County, Montana, 1979.  Holter is the name of a lake in Lewis and Clark County.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT0379.  

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 12 inches (A1 and A1 horizons)
Argillic horizon - the zone from 12 to 42 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons) 
Particle-size control section - the zone from 12 to 32 inches (the Bt1 and part of the Bt2 horizon)    

Holter soils have a frigid soil temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.

The Holter series should be investigated in the future to verify the ranges of rock fragments in the Bt and Bk horizons.  The 1998 OSD listed more than 60 percent in these horizons but the NASIS data did not support fragment ranges that high.
