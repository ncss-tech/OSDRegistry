HONTOON SERIES

The Hontoon series consists of deep, very poorly drained, organic soils that formed in more than 130 centimeters (51 inches) of well decomposed, hydrophytic, herbaceous plant remains. Hontoon soils are in depressions, freshwater marshes, swamps and drainageways.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1300 millimeters (51 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F).

There are no other known series in this family.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Hontoon soils are in depressions, freshwater marshes, swamps and drainageways of peninsular Florida. 
Parent material: 130 centimeters or more (51 inches) of well decomposed, hydrophytic, herbaceous plant remains
Landscape: Lower Coastal Plains 
Landforms: Freshwater marshes, swamps, drainageways, and depressions on marine terraces
Hillslopes profile position: none applicable 
Geomorphic component: Dip and Tread 
Slopes: 0 to 1 percent 
Elevation: 1 to 41 meters (1 to 135 feet)
Mean annual precipitation: 940 to 1,570 millimeters (37 to 62 inches) 
Mean annual air temperature: 20 to 25 degrees C (68 to 77 degrees F)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
These are Samsula, Tomoka, Basinger, Electra, Immokalee, Myakka, Placid, Pomello, Pomona, and St. Johns soils.  
Samsula soils have organic layers less than 130 centimeters (51 inches) thick and occur in topographic positions similar to those of Hontoon soils. 
Tomoka are organic layers less than 114 centimeters (45 inches) thick and occur in topographic positions similar to those of Hontoon soils. 
Basinger and Placid soils are mineral, do not have spodic horizons and occur in topographic positions similar to those of Hontoon soils.
St. Johns soils are mineral, have a spodic horizon and occur in topographic positions similar to those of Hontoon soils.
Electra, Immokalee and Myakka are mineral soils, have spodic horizons and are on higher lying convex ridges and in the adjacent flatwoods. 
Pomello soils are better drained, are mineral, have spodic horizons and occur on higher lying convex ridges of the mapped areas. 
Pomona soils have a spodic horizon and an argillic horizon below 130 centimeters (51 inches) and are in the adjacent flatwoods.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class: Very poorly drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat): very high to high 
Permeability: rapid
Surface runoff: negligible
Depth to seasonal high water table: Under natural conditions the soil is covered by water (ponded), or the water table is within 25 centimeters (10 inches) of the surface for 6 to 9 months during most years except during extended dry periods. In drained areas, the water table is artificially controlled at a depth of 25 to 91 centimeters (10 to 36 inches) or according to the need of the crop.
Flooding frequency and duration: None
Ponding frequency and duration: Frequently for very long duration (9 to 12 months)

USE AND VEGETATION:  
Under natural conditions Hontoon soils are used for water quality, water storage, and wildlife habitat. 
Potential natural vegetation consists of loblolly bay, maple, gum, and scattered cypress trees with a ground cover of greenbriers, ferns, and other aquatic plants. In a few areas there is a ground cover of osmunda fern.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Major Land Resource Areas (MLRA):  This soil mainly occurs in South Central Florida Ridge (MLRA 154). It also occurs in moderate extent in Southern Florida Flatwoods (MLRA 155) and in less extent in Southern Florida Lowlands (MLRA 156B).
Extent: Moderate extent
