REMARKS: These soils were formerly included in the tidal marsh miscellaneous area. They are flooded by tidal waters and become extremely acidic when drained. 
Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Fibric material--the zone from 0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches) has a fiber content after rubbing that is three-fourths or more of the soil volume (Oi horizon)
Hemic material--the zone from 18 to 33 centimeters (7 to 13 inches) has a fiber content after rubbing that is between one-sixth and three-fourths of the soil volume (Oe horizon)
Sapric material--the zone from 33 to 56 centimeters (13 to 22 inches) has a fiber content after rubbing that is less than one-sixth of the soil volume (Oa horizon)
Sulfidic materials--more than 0.75 percent sulfur, with less than three times as much carbonate (CaCO3 equivalent) as sulfur, within a depth of 40 inches
High n-value--the zone from 56 to 165 centimeters (22 to 65 inches) has an n-value less than 0.7, the material does not flow easily between the fingers
Argillic horizon--the zone from 91 to 165 centimeters (36 to 65 inches) (Btg horizons) 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data for the typical pedon is available from NSSL, Pedon number S86MD-019-008(1-7). Refer to publication "Tidal Marsh Soils of Maryland", Darmody, R.G. and Foss, J.E., Maryland Agricultural Experiment Station Publication MP 930, October 1978.
