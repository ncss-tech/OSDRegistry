SERIES ESTABLISHED: Dorchester County, Maryland, 1992

REMARKS: 
Honga soils were formerly mapped as Tidal Marsh miscellaneous areas. They are flooded twice daily by tidal waters. These soils may become extremely acid to ultra acid when drained. Historically, large areas of these soils were ditched for mosquito control, which has led to marsh degradation in some areas.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon (Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Thirteenth Edition):
Aquic conditions--the zone from 0 to 200 centimeters is continuously saturated (endosaturation)
Fibric soil materials--the zone from 0 to 18 centimeters has a fiber content after rubbing that is three-fourths or more of the soil volume (Oise horizon)
Hemic soil materials--the zone from 18 to 33 centimeters has a fiber content after rubbing that is between one-sixth and three-fourths of the soil volume (Oese horizon)
Sapric soil materials--the zone from 33 to 56 centimeters has a fiber content after rubbing that is less than one-sixth of the soil volume (Oase horizon)
Hypersulfidic materials--the zone from 0 to 56 centimeters has a sulfur content of 0.75 percent or greater by dry mass, mostly in the form of sulfides
Fluidity--the mineral horizons (zone from 56 to 165 centimeters) are nonfluid (low n-value)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 91 to 200 centimeters (Btg horizons)
Control section--the zone from 0 to 130 centimeters.
