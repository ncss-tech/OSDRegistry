HARLAN SERIES

The Harlan series consists of deep or very deep, well drained soils on relict alluvial fans, terraces, strike valleys and valley side slopes. Harlan soils formed in alluvium, slope alluvium or colluvium derived from redbed shales and interbedded siltstone and sandstone. Slopes are 0 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Harlan loam-rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 13 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; strong very fine granular structure; soft, very friable; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 15 cm thick)

    AB--13 to 20 cm; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) heavy loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, very friable; few thin clay films on faces of some peds; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 10 cm thick)

    Bt--20 to 51 cm; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) light clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; strong medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium angular and subangular blocky; very hard, very friable; thin continuous clay films on faces of peds and in root channels and pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary. (13 to 51 cm thick)

    Btk--51 to 66 cm; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) heavy loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, very friable; common thin clay films on some faces of peds and in some root channels; strongly effervescent, some visible secondary calcium carbonate occurring as concretions and in thin seams and streaks; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 25 cm thick)

    Bk--66 to 152 cm; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) moist; massive; hard, very friable; strongly effervescent, visible secondary calcium carbonate occurring as concretions and in seams and streaks; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2);
