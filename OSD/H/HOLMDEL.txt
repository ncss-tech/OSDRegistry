MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Burlington County, New Jersey, 1967

REMARKS: 5/2003--This revision updates redoximorphic features to current standards and revises competing series and geographically associated soils sections. The content of glauconite in the C horizon was also broadened from 2 to 10 percent to 2 to 15 percent to facilitate the correlation of Anne Arundel County, Maryland. Additionally, colors, geographic setting, parent materials and other features as well as ranges in characteristics were also revised. This OSD was also converted to tabular format. This series has historically been used as a dual drainage class soil and has been maintained with this revision to facilitate ongoing correlations.

Some pedons have been observed to have thin, weakly iron-cemented lenses in the C horizon of this soil.  These lenses have not been described to be significant enough for a petroferric contact or zone of induration.  

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 12 inches (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 12 to 38 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Aquic conditions (Aquic subgroup)--iron depletions and concentrations at 20 inches (within upper 24 inches of the argillic horizon)

Low glauconite pellet content feature---glauconite pellet content averages between 2 and 10 percent by volume within the mineralogy control section (upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon)
