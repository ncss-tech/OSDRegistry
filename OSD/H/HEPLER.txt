HEPLER SERIES

The Hepler series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in silty alluvial sediments.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on flood plains in the Cherokee Prairies (MLRA 112) and Ozark Highlands (MLRA 116A).  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1067 mm (42 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 14 degrees C (58 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  Similar soils are the Quarles, Moniteau, and McGirk series.  Quarles soils are fine textured in the particle size control section.  McGirk soils have a mesic soil temperature regime, fine textured in the control section, and a smectitic mineralogy.  Leanna soils have a fine textured control section and occur on stream terraces on river valleys.  Moniteau soils: are in the mesic soil temperature regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hepler soils are on high flood plains on river valleys.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  The soils formed in silty alluvial sediments.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 1295 mm (32 to 51 inches).  Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.2 to 19.4 degrees C (45 to 67 degrees F).  Annual Thornthwaite P-E Index: 64 to 78.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cherokee, Lightning, Mason, Osage, Parsons, Radley, Verdigris, Wynona, Leanna, and McCune soils.  Cherokee soils have a fine particle size control section, and occur on low terraces on river valleys.  Lightning soils have a fine  particle size control section, poorly drained, and occur on floodplain steps on River valleys.  Mason soils contain a mollic epipedon, well to moderately well drained, rarely flooded, and occur on higher floodplain steps on river valleys.  Osage soils have a mollic epipedon, are fine textured, do not have an argillic horizon, and occur on similar landscape positions.  Parsons soils have a fine  particle size control section and occur on uplands of plains.  Radley soils have a mollic epipedon, do not have an argillic horizon, moderately well drained, and occur on floodplain steps of river valleys.  Verdigris soils: have a mollic epipedon, do not have an argillic horizon, well drained, and occur on similar landscape positions.   Wynona soils have a mollic epipedon, do not have an argillic horizon, and occur on floodplain steps on river valleys.  McCune soils have a glossic horizon and occur on low terraces on plains.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  Depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 30 to 91 cm (12 to 36 inches) between January and May in normal years.  Potential for surface runoff is low or very slow.  Sturated hydraulic conductivity is Moderately High.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Hepler series is subject to occasional or frequent flooding.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mostly cultivated.  Principal crops are winter wheat, soybeans, grain sorghum, and corn.  Native vegetation is hardwood forest with an understory of tall prairie grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  MLRAs 112 and 116 in southeastern Kansas, southwestern Missouri and eastern Oklahoma.  The type location is in MLRA 112.  The series is of moderate extent.
