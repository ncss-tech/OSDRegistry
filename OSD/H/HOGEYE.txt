HOGEYE SERIES

The Hogeye series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from granitic rock. Hogeye soils are on mountains and hills. Slopes range from 15 to 60 percent. The average annual precipitation is 10 to 16 (250 to 410 mm) inches. The average annual temperature is 57 to 62 degrees F (14 to 16 degrees C). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, nonacid, thermic Typic Xerorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Hogeye coarse sandy loam on a 25 percent slope at 2,680 feet (815 meters elevation under grass and oak tree vegetation. (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated. When the soil was described 4/13/81 the soil was moist throughout.)

    A1--0 to 2 inches (0 to 5 cm); brown (10YR 4/3) coarse sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 1 percent boulders and 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick)

    A2--2 to 20 inches (5 to 51 cm); brown (10YR 5/3) coarse sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine and medium roots; common very fine interstitial and few very fine tubular pores; 1 percent boulders and 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick)

    C--20 to 29 inches (51 to 74 cm); brown (10YR 5/3) coarse sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and coarse roots; common very fine interstitial and few very fine tubular pores; 1 percent boulders and 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt irregular boundary. (8 to 18 inches thick)

    Cr--29 to 41 inches 74 to 104 cm); highly weathered decomposing granitic bedrock.

    R--41 inches (104 cm); hard fractured granitic bedrock. 

TYPE LOCATION: Kern County, California. About 1 mile northwest of the town of Lake Isabella; 1800 feet north and 2200 feet east of the SW quarter of section 36 T.26S; R.32E; M.D.B.M. Lake Isabella South quadrangle; lat. 35 degrees 37 minutes 17 seconds  N and long. 118 degrees 29 minutes  46 seconds  W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Depth to paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches (51 to 102 cm). Depth to lithic contact is 30 to more than 50 inches (76 to 127 cm).

Soil moisture - dry from June 1 to November 1

Soil temperature - The mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F (15 to 18 degrees C). Average annual: 60 to 63 degrees F. (15.5 to 17 degrees C) above 41 degrees F (5 degrees C) from February 1 to December 1 (290 to 310 days) above 47 degrees F (8 degrees C) from February 15 to November 15 (260 to 280)

Reaction is neutral or slightly acid throughout.

Clay percentage: 10 to 18

Texture control section: Textures are coarse sandy loam, sandy loam or gravelly coarse sandy loam. There is 5 to 35 percent rock fragments composed mainly of fine gravel. 

A horizon - Value: 4,5 or 6 dry and 3,4 or 5 moist. 
            Chroma: 3 or 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist. 
            Organic Matter: 0.5 to 1 percent

C horizon - Value: 5 or 6 dry and 3,4 or 5 moist.
            Chroma: 3 or 4 dry and 3 or 4 moist.
            Organic Matter: less than 0.5 percent.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Hanford, Honcut, Pollasky, and Saugus series. Hanford and Honcut soils are very deep alluvial soils. Pollasky soils lack a paralithic contact, have less than 25 percent coarse and very coarse sands and are on moderately consolidated sediments. Saugus soils are deep to weakly consolidated sediments. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hogeye soils are on hills and mountains at elevations of 2,600 to 4,600 feet (792 to 1402 meters). Slopes are 15 to 60 percent. Rock outcrops are associated with these soils in some areas. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 16 inches (250 to 410 mm) and the mean annual temperature is 57 to 62 degrees F (14 to 16 degrees C). The frost-free season is 175 to 210 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kernville and Hungrygulch soils. Kernville soils are sandy and have a paralithic contact at 6 to 20 inches. Hungrygulch soils have mesic soil temperature regimes. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is mainly narrowleaf goldenbush, red brome, wild oats, with scattered digger pine, blue oak, and scrub oak. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Sierra Nevada Range in California. These soils are of small extent in MLRA 18.
