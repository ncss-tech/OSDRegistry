HIGHVALLEY SERIES

The Highvalley series consists of very deep, well drained soils with moderate permeability that formed in colluvium from basalt and welded tuff mixed with volcanic ash throughout. Slopes range from 15 to 65 percent in mountains. The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, isotic, frigid Vitrandic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Highvalley ashy loam, forested -- on a southwest-facing slope of 35 percent at 5,660 feet elevation. When described on October 19, 1994, the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

   Oi--0 to 1 inch; slightly decomposed forest litter.

   A--1 to 5 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) ashy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine and medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; many very fine, fine and medium irregular pores; 5 percent fine gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.1); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 10 inches thick) 

   AB--5 to 10 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) ashy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; many very fine, fine and medium irregular pores; 1 percent fine gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.1); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick) 

   Bw1--10 to 24 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) ashy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; many very fine, fine and medium tubular pores; 5 percent fine gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick) 

   Bw2--24 to 48 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) ashy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak medium prismatic structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine, fine and medium tubular pores; 2 percent fine gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 30 inches thick) 

   Bw3--48 to 66 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) ashy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine, fine and medium tubular pores; 2 percent fine gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Buford, Derr (T), Hall Ranch, Kahler, McGarr, Minam and Myzel (T) series. Buford soils are 40 to 60 inches to bedrock and have buried Bw horizons. Derr soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to shale bedrock. Hall Ranch soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to paralithic contact. Kahler soils have vitrandic features to depths of 20 to 40 inches, typically over a lithologic discontinuity (2C horizons), has clay ranging to 35 percent and rock fragments ranging to 35 percent in the particle-size control section. Minam soils have 20 to 30 percent glass in the A horizon and 2C horizons with greater than 35 percent rock fragments within 20 to 30 inches. McGarr soils are 20 ro 40 inches to a lithic contact (basalt).  Myzel soils are moderately well drained with seasonal high water table at 30 to 48 inches and average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Highvalley soils are on mountain slopes at elevations of 3,750 to 6,800 feet. These soils formed in colluvium from basalt and welded tuff mixed with volcanic ash throughout. Slopes range from 15 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is 26 to 36 inches. The average annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 60 to 90 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hoff, Longs and Shilling soils. Hoff soils are shallow to bedrock on convex areas. Longs and Shilling soils are loamy-skeletal on similar geomorphic positions. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; rapid to very rapid runoff; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Highvalley soils are used mainly for timber production and woodland grazing. Native vegetation is Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, grand fir, mountain maple and mallow ninebark. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West-central Idaho. MLRA 43b. 
Highvalley soils are not extensive.
