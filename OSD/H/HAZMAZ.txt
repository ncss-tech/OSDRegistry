HAZMAZ SERIES

The Hazmaz series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits over glaciofluvial deposits derived from sedimentary and quartzite rocks.  Hazmaz soils are on strath terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Calcic Petrocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hazmaz loam, on a south facing, linear, 2 percent slope in cropland at an elevation of 5,750 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(8 to 14 inches thick)

    2Bkm--31 to 41 inches; indurated calcium carbonate cemented hardpan.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Parent material:  eolian deposits over glaciofluvial deposits derived from sedimentary and quartzite rocks
Landform:  structural benches
Slopes:  1 to 8 percent
Elevation: 5,600 to 6,700 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  45 to 49 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  8 to 12 inches
Frost-free period:  110 to 140 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Abracon, Cobbra, Crib, Clapper, Pinetown, and Yarts series.  

Abracon, Cobbra, Crib, Clapper, and Yarts soils are very deep and do not have petrocalcic horizons.

Pinetown soils are shallow.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  well drained, low runoff, moderate and moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major uses are irrigated cropland, irrigated pasture, and rangeland.  Potential native vegetation consists of Wyoming big sagebrush, Indian ricegrass, galleta, bottlebrush squirreltail and needleandthread.  These soils are correlated to Semidesert Loam (Wyoming Big Sagebrush) - 034XY212UT range sites in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeast Utah.  LRR D, MLRA 34.  This series is of small extent.
