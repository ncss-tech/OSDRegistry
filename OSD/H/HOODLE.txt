HOODLE SERIES

The Hoodle series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium, slope alluvium and colluvium from volcanic and mixed origins. These soils are on pediments and ridges. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 3.8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Hoodle gravelly loam in rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A1--0 to 5 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 25 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.7); gradual smooth boundary.

    A2--5 to 23 cm; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; 20 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary. (combined thickness of the A horizons is 8 to 36 cm thick)

    Bt1--23 to 33 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine and few medium roots; few fine tubular pores; few thin clay bridges between sand grains and as coatings on peds; 25 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary.

    Bt2--33 to 48 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very cobbly sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few medium roots; common fine tubular and coarse interstitial pores; few thin clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 5 percent gravel and 50 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary.

    Bt3--48 to 69 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely cobbly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine and medium roots; common medium and coarse interstitial pores; few thin clay films in pores; 5 percent gravel and 60 percent cobbles; very slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 31 to 68 cm thick)

    Bk--69 to 152 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely cobbly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few medium and coarse interstitial pores; thin hard carbonate coats on bottom surfaces of rock fragments; common coarse distinct very pale brown (10YR 8/2) weakly cemented fragments of carbonate pan; 10 percent gravel and 65 percent cobbles; strongly and violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - pediments and ridges
Elevation - 1,980 to 3,050
Slope - 0 to 60 percent
Parent material - alluvium, slope alluvium and colluvium 
Mean annual precipitation - 380 to 635 mm
Mean annual air temperature - 2.2 to 6.6 degrees C

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Castino and Tatiyee soils. Castino soils have over 35 percent clay in the Bt horizons and are 50 to 100 cm deep to bedrock. Tatiyee soils have over 35 percent clay in the Bt horizons and lack a calcic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Hoodle soils are used mainly for rangeland. Native vegetation is low sagebrush, green rabbitbrush, needleandthread, bluebunch wheatgrass, bluegrasses, and widely spaced Wyoming big sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Hoodle soils are moderately extensive in Utah, Colorado and Wyoming. MLRAs - 25, 34A, 43B, 46, 47, 48A.
