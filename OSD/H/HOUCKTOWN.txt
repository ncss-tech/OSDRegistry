HOUCKTOWN SERIES

The Houcktown series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are deep to dense till. They formed in loamy water-sorted material 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) thick and in the underlying till. They are on till plains, wave-worked till plains, and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bogart, Centerburg, Cygnet, Haney, Jenera, Jugtown, Nicely, Reaville, Scattersville, Swampoodle, Thackery, Tuscola, Vallonia (T), Vanlue, and Williamstown series. Bogart, Haney, and Thackery soils have more than 7 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Centerburg, Jenera, Jugtown, Tuscola, and Vallonia, Vanlue soils do not have a densic contact within the series control section. Cygnet soils are deeper than 102 cm (40 inches) to till and do not have the lower part of the argillic horizon formed in till. Nicely soils are deeper than 127 cm (50 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Reaville soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Scattersville and Swampoodle soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 114 cm (45 inches). Williamstown soils average less than 23 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Houcktown soils are on till plains, wave-worked till plains, and lake plains of late Wisconsin age. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. The soils formed in loamy water-sorted material 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) thick and in the underlying till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 1067 mm (27 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 12 degrees C (45 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 182 days. Elevation is 213 to 305 meters (700 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the somewhat poorly drained Aurand and Haskins soils and very poorly drained Mermill soils on lake plains; and the moderately well drained Glynwood soils, somewhat poorly drained Blount soils, poorly drained Ziegenfuss soils, and very poorly drained Pewamo soils on till plains.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 30 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) between November and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is very low to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part of the solum and moderately low in the lower part, and low in the dense till. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum, moderately slow or slow in the lower part of the solum, and slow or very slow in the dense till.

USE AND VEGETATION: A large proportion is under cultivation, primarily corn, soybeans, wheat, and hay. A relatively small proportion is in woodland. Native vegetation is deciduous forest, principally ash, beech, elm, and maple.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 111B in west central Ohio and possibly eastern Indiana, and to a lesser extent in MLRA 99 in northwestern Ohio. The series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Hancock County, Ohio, 1997.

REMARKS: Houcktown soils are currently being converted from Haney, Haskins, and Rawson soils during modernization projects.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 25 cm (Ap horizon).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 25 to 84 cm (Bt, 2Bt horizons).
Densic contact: at 127 cm (top of the 2Cd1 horizon.
Aquic conditions: redox features in all horizons below a depth of 25 cm.

Supporting laboratory data is needed to confirm the presence of densic materials in the 2Cd horizon.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory characterization data (HK-46) is available from The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory for the typical pedon.

Representative data mapunit is DMU ID 129999 in MO 11.
