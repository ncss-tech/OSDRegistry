TYPE LOCATION: Wood County, West Virginia; 225 yards south of Belleville, 450 yards west of State Route No. 2

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Depth to the top of the Argillic, Cambic, Spodic, Fragipan, etc.: 25 to 67 cm (10 to 24 inches)
Solum Thickness: 100 to 175 cm (40 to 70 inches)
Depth to Bedrock: greater than 200 cm (80 inches)
Depth to Seasonal High Water Table: Greater than 150 cm (60 inches)
Depth to Lithologic Discontinuity: Greater than 200 centimeters (80 inches)
Rock Fragment content: Less than 3 percent in the solum.  0 to 30 percent in the C horizon
Soil Reaction: Moderately acid to moderately alkaline (pH - 5.6 to 7.8)
Other soil features: Mica flakes are common in many pedons.

A or Ap horizon
Color--hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1, 2, or 3.
Texture (fine earth fraction)--dominantly silt loam, ranges to silty clay loam and loam.

AB or BA horizon (where present)
Color--hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3 in ped interiors.  Ped surface colors are similar to the matrix colors of the A or Ap horizon.

Bw horizon
Color--hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Ped coatings commonly have value of 3, but range from 2 through 4.
Texture (fine earth fraction)--silt loam or silty clay loam.  Clay content averages less than 30 percent.

C horizon
Color--hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Ped coatings commonly have value of 3, but range from 2 through 4.
Texture (fine earth fraction)--silt loam, fine sandy loam, loam, fine sand, silty clay loam, and sandy clay loam.  Commonly contains more sand than the Bw horizon and is stratified.

COMPETING SERIES:  Dapue is the only other series in this family.  Armiesburg and Omadi are in closely related families.  Dapue soils have a thicker solum.  Armiesburg soils contain more than 30 percent clay in the Bw horizon.  Omadi soils contain free carbonates and have solum thickness of less than 20 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Geographic Setting: River Valley
Landform: Flood plain
Geomorphic Component: Base slope
Hillslope Profile Position: Toeslope

Mean Annual Air Temperature: 8 to 15 degrees C (47 to 59 degrees F)
Mean Annual Precipitation: 890 to 1400 mm (35 to 55 inches)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Allegheny, Ashton, Chagrin, Dunning, Kanawha, Lindside, Melvin, Monongahela, Newark, Sciotoville, and Wheeling soils.  The Allegheny, Monongahela.  Sciotoville, and Wheeling soils have argillic horizons and are on stream terraces.  Ashton and Kanawha soils are well drained and are on low stream terraces on high flood plains.  The Chagrin, Dunning, Lindside, Melvin, and Newark soils are on flood plains.  Chagrin soils are well drained; Lindside soils are moderately well drained; Newark soils are somewhat poorly drained; and Melvin and Dunning soils are poorly drained.
