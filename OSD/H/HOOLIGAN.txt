HOOLIGAN SERIES

The Hooligan series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits over residuum. These soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, escarpments, hills, mountain slopes and landslides. Slopes are 2 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 36 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Ustic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Hooligan silt loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

  A1--0 to 5 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak very fine and fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak very fine and fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine and fine dendritic tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary.

  A2--5 to 10 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak very fine and fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak very fine and fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine and fine dendritic tubular pores; 10 percent mica flakes; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary. (combined thickness of A horizons - 7 to 15 inches) 

  Bt1--10 to 26 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3), gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine and few fine dendritic tubular pores; common faint patchy clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent mica flakes; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.7); clear wavy boundary.

  Bt2--26 to 35 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4), clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine and few fine dendritic tubular pores; common faint patchy clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent mica flakes; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary. (combined thickness of Bt horizons - 10 to 25 inches)

  Cr1--35 to 45 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 7/3) semi-consolidated siltite beds that crush to loam, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) moist; neutral (pH 7.1); gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 15 inches thick)

  Cr2--45 to 60 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 7/3) semi-consolidated siltite beds that crush to loam, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) moist; neutral (pH 7.0).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Monaberg and Inabnit soils. The Monaberg soils are very deep and are in swales and on footslopes. The Inabnit soils are shallow and are on ridges of foothills.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Hooligan soils are used mainly for rangeland and wildlife habitat. Potential native vegetation includes Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, as well as other grasses, forbs, and woody shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Hooligan soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana. MLRAs - 43B, 44B.
