MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Rockingham County, North Carolina; 2009.

REMARKS: Haw River soils were previously mapped as Chastain (thermic series). Due to the establishment of mesic regions in the Southern Piedmont, this soil is proposed as a mesic counterpart to the Chastain soils. 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to 6 inches (A horizon)
Aquic conditions--the zone from 6 inches to a depth of 80 inches is periodically saturated (endosaturation)
