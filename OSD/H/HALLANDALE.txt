HALLANDALE SERIES

The Hallandale series consists of shallow and very shallow, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in thin deposits of sandy marine sediments over limestone. Hallandale soils are on low broad flats, sloughs, flatwoods, and in depressions on marine terraces. Slopes are linear and range from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1448 centimeters (57 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 21 degrees C (71 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Siliceous, isohyperthermic Lithic Psammaquents

Broward County, Florida; 1973.

REMARKS: 
Particle sized control section:  25 to 41 centimeters (10 to 16 inches)

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - 0 to 25 centimeters (0 to 10 inches) (A, E horizons)

Albic horizon - 10 to 25 centimeters (4 to 10 inches) (E horizon)

Lithic contact - 41 centimeters (16 inches) (2R horizon)

Aquic conditions - 0 to 30 centimeters (0 to 12 inches)

Endosaturation - 0 to 41 centimeters (0 to 16 inches)

This series does not contain a cambic horizon, it does not meet in taxonomy 2 a (1) which is soil structure or the absence of rock structure including fine stratification in more than  of the volume of the horizon. See Soil Taxonomy for additional information. 

Tidal phases of the Hallandale series are on tidal flats and have electrical conductivity values of between 16 and 24. These areas will be investigated during MLRA update activities to determine if a new series is needed. Hallandale soils with EC's greater than 16 would have saline-sodic properties that would change classification.

Taxonomic Version:  Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 12th Edition.
