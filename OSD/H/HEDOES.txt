HEDOES SERIES

The Hedoes series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and alluvium from igneous rocks.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, hills, and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hedoes loam, pastureland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 4 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many medium and fine roots; neutral (pH 6.6); clear boundary. 

    A2--4 to 9 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; common fine and very fine pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear boundary. (combined thickness of A horizons is 8 to 16 inches thick)

    Bw--9 to 17 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; common fine pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 26 inches thick)

    Bk1--17 to 34 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) coarse sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; 10 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; common fine masses and seams of lime; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual irregular boundary. (6 to 24 inches thick)

    2Bk2--34 to 60 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; single grain; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 45 percent gravel, and 5 percent cobbles; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent, continuous thin lime casts on underside of fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).
