HODENPYL SERIES

The Hodenpyl series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy deposits overlying sandy deposits on outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 7.1 degrees C (45 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, active, frigid Haplic Glossudalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Hodenpyl sandy loam, on a south-facing, convex, 2 percent slope in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

 Ap--0 to 25 cm (10 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) sandy loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; friable; many fine roots; 1 percent gravel; strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 inches) thick] 

 B/E--25 to 43 cm (10 to 17 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) sandy loam (Bt) occupies about 75 percent of the horizon surrounded by brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam (E); moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine roots; 1 percent gravel; 2 percent (A) material in old root channels; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. [5 to 18 cm (2 to 7 inches) thick] 

 Bt--43 to 71 cm (17 to 28 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) sandy loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; thin dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) clay films on faces of peds and in root channels; common fine roots; 1 percent gravel; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. [28 to 71 cm (11 to 28 inches) thick] 

 2E and Bt--71 to 203 cm (28 to 80 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) sand (E); single grain; loose; with lamellae of strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) loamy sand (Bt); weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; wavy and discontinuous 2 mm to 1 cm (1/16 to 1/2 inch) thick lamellae; few fine roots; 2 percent gravel; neutral. 

TYPE LOCATION: Wexford County, Michigan; 1 1/2 miles west and 1/2 mile south of Buckley; 100 feet east and 2615 feet south of the northwest corner of sec. 12, T. 24 N., R. 12 W.; USGS Mesick, Michigan topographic quadrangle; lat. 44 degrees 29 minutes 24.6 seconds N. and long. 85 degrees 42 minutes 58.5 W., NAD 27. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Depth to the lithologic discontinuity: 51 to 114 cm (20 to 45 inches)

Ap or A horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 2 to 4
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam 
Rock fragment content: 1 or 2 percent gravel 
Reaction: strongly acid to slightly acid

E part of the B/E horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 3 to 5
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam
Rock fragment content: 1 or 2 percent gravel 
Reaction: moderately acid to very strongly acid

Some pedons have a separate E horizon below the A horizon with similar colors and textures as the E part of the B/E horizon. 

Bt part of the Bt/E horizon and the Bt horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 4 to 6
Texture: sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam
Rock fragment content: 1 or 2 percent gravel
Reaction: strongly acid to slightly acid

Some pedons have an E/B horizon. 

E part of the 2E and Bt horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 5 or 6
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: sand

Bt part of the 2E and Bt horizon: 
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 4 to 6
Texture: loamy sand or sandy loam; individual lamella range from 2 mm to 10 cm (1/8 to 4 inches) thick Rock fragment content: 1 to 10 percent gravel
Reaction: very strongly acid to neutral

2C horizon, where present:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 5 or 6
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: sand
Reaction: strongly acid to neutral 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Millersburg, Oconto, Omena, and Perote series. Millersburg soils have textures coarser than sandy loam in the upper part of the control section. Oconto, Omena, and Perote soils do not have lamellae.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hodenpyl soils are on outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. The soils formed in 51 to 114 cm (20 to 45 inches) of loamy material overlying sandy deposits. Mean annual temperature ranges from 4.4 to 7.8 degrees C (40 to 46 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 864 mm (27 to 34 inches). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the East Lake, Kalkaska, and Karlin soils. These somewhat excessively drained soils have more sand in the upper part of the profile and do not have argillic horizons. They are on similar landscape positions as the Hodenpyl soils. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Potential for runoff is very low or low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately rapid. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. Corn, wheat, and hay are the principal crops. Plantations of scotch pine and red pine are common. Small wooded areas support native stands of sugar maple, American beech, black cherry, and eastern hemlock. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 94A in the northern part of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. This series is of small extent.
