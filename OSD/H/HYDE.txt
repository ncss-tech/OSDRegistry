MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Hyde County, North Carolina; 1909 (Lake Mattamuskeet Area).

REMARKS: The Hyde series is centered on a high content of silt plus very fine sand in the control section.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
Umbric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 15 inches. (The Ap and A horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone between 15 and 51 inches. (The Btg1 and Btg2 
horizons)
Aquic conditions--observed endosaturation near the surface and redoximorphic features consisting of iron depletions and accumulations in the zone between 15 and 62 inches (Btg1, Btg2, Btg3 and Cg horizons)
