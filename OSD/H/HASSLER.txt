HASSLER SERIES

The Hassler series consist of deep, moderately well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in loamy colluvium and residuum weathered from acid igneous rocks, primarily granite. These soils are on mountain ridgetops, lower sideslopes, and benches. Slopes range from 3 to 25 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 43 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Oxyaquic Hapludults

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Chilmark, Roselle, and Tulip series. All of these soils are more than 60 inches to a lithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hassler soils are on mountain ridgetops, lower sideslopes, and benches. They formed in loamy colluvial sediments and residuum derived from acid igneous rocks, primarily granite. Slopes range from 3 to 25 percent. The mean annual temperature is 54 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 38 to 46 inches. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Courtois, Delassus, Irondale, Knobtop, Syenite, Taumsauk, and Trackler series. Courtois soils have more clay and a higher base saturation. They occur where intermontane basins are underlain by dolomite and limestone. Delassus soils have a fragipan and are on broader summit positions. Irondale and Taumsauk soils are well drained, loamy-skeletal and are on similar landscape positions. Knobtop soils are moderately deep, fine-silty, and are on mountain ridgetops. Syenite soils are well drained, moderately deep to bedrock, and are on steeper side slopes. Trackler soils have iron depletions higher in their profiles and formed in fine-grained igneous rocks (rhyolite). They are on similar landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. Runoff is medium to high. Permeability is moderate. A perched water table is from 2.5 to 4 feet during brief periods in winter and early spring.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in forest. Other areas are cleared and used for grass and legume pasture or hay crops. Native vegetation was mixed hardwoods and pines.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Igneous landscapes within the St. Francois Mountains of the Missouri Ozarks (MLRA 116A). The series is of small extent.

REMARKS: These soils were previously included in mapping with the Syenite series. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 1) Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 9.5 inches (Oi, A, E, and BE horizons)2) Argillic horizon - the zone from 9.5 to 31.5 inches (Bt1, Bt2, 2Bt3 horizons)
