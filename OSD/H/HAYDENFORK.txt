HAYDENFORK SERIES

The Haydenfork series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium and glacial outwash derived from sandstone and quartzite.  Haydenfork soils are in kettles of glaciated mountains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Typic Cryaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Haydenfork clay loam, in a concave position, 2 percent slope in a wet meadow at an elevation of 9,800 feet.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on September 28, 1976, the soil was moist from the surface to ground water at 25 inches.

    Oi--0 to 3 inches; slightly decomposed leaf litter.

    A1--3 to 9 inches; black (10YR 2/1) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) dry; weak coarse subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine and medium granular; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; few very fine pores; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary (4 to 10 inches thick).

    A2--9 to 17 inches; black (10YR 2/1) clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to strong fine and medium subangular blocky; extremely hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine pores; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary (5 to 10 inches thick).

    A3--17 to 21 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine pores; many medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) iron concentrations; moderately acid (pH 6.0); abrupt smooth boundary (0 to 5 inches thick).

    Bg--21 to 25 inches; gray (5Y 5/1) clay loam, light gray (5Y 7/2) dry; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine pores; common medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) iron concentrations; slightly acid (pH 6.1); abrupt smooth boundary (4 to 10 inches thick).

    Cg--25 to 36 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; massive; very hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine pores; 10 percent gravel; coarse prominent gray (5Y 5/1) iron depletions; moderately acid (pH 6.0); abrupt smooth boundary (5 to 15 inches thick).

    C1--36 to 55 inches; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) sandy clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; massive; very hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 10 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); abrupt smooth boundary (10 to 20 inches thick).

    C2--55 to 63 inches; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) gravelly sandy clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; massive; very hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 15 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Summit County, Utah, 2000; Summit Area soil survey.  The name is from Hayden Fork drainageway in Summit County.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 3 to 21 inches.  (A1, A2, and A3 horizons)
Aquic conditions (endosaturation): from 17 to 63 inches (A3, Bg, Cg, C1, and C2 horizons) at some time in most years.  Inferred from redox features and from the observed saturation at 25 inches.
