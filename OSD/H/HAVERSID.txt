HAVERSID SERIES

The Haversid series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium on flood plains, terraces, and in drainageways.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Ustic Torrifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Haversid silt loam - grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

   A--0 to 14 inches ( 0 to 35 cm); pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium platy and weak very fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 14 inches thick)

   C1--14 to 32 inches (35 to 81 cm); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak coarse platy and weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.    (7 to 20 inches thick.)

   Czy--32 to 53 inches (81 to 135 cm); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) stratified loam and clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak coarse platy structure and massive; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; common fine rounded salt masses; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth boundary.  (15 to 21 inches thick.)

   C2--53 to 60 inches (135 to 152 cm); pale brown (10YR 6/3) stratified loam and fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium coarse platy structure and massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Las Animas County, Colorado; approximately 2300 feet south and 700 feet west of the northeast corner of Sec. 29, T. 33 S., R. 61 W.; latitude 37 degrees 8 minutes 25 seconds N. and longitude 104 degrees 15 minutes 09 seconds W, NAD 1983

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
This soil is intermittently moist in some part during the peak periods of moisture of April through August and is driest December through February.
Mean annual soil temperature: 47 to 55 degrees F.
Mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 78 degrees F.
Organic carbon: ranges from .6 to 2 percent in the surface horizon and decreases irregularly with depth.  
Depth to carbonates: 0 to 4 inches
Textures are stratified with strata ranging from sandy loam to clay loam, but averaging approximately loam.
Visible calcium carbonate, soluble salts and gypsum may occur at any depth, but is not usually concentrated into any consistent horizon of accumulation.

The particle-size control section: (Weighted average)
Clay content: 18 to 35 percent
Silt content: 10 to 50 percent
Sand content: 20 to 60 percent, with more than 15 percent fine and coarser sand
Rock fragments range from 0 to 20 percent.  

A horizon: 
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.

C horizons: 
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 1 through 4
Texture: stratified sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, and clay loam.  
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  1 to 15 percent. 
Exchangeable sodium percentage: 1 to 10 percent.  
Reaction: moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  
Buried A and B horizons may occur below a depth of 40 inches. 
Gypsum content: 0 to 5 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Hamburn (NM), Haverdad (WY), Manikan (AZ), Panitchen (CO), San Mateo (NM), and Suwanee (NM). 
Hamburn soils: have an SAR ranging from 13 to 30 percent in the substratum.
Haverdad soils: are dry 60 consecutive days from July 15 to October.
Manikan, and Suwanee soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder.  
Panitchen and San Mateo soils: have a moisture control section that is dry in May and June. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: mixed calcareous alluvium
Landform: flood plains, terraces, and narrow drainageways
Flooding: ranges from occasional to rarely flooded.  
Elevation ranges from 3400 to 6500 feet.
Slope:  0 to 6 percent.
Mean annual precipitation: 12 to 14 inches, with peak periods occurring from April to August.
Mean annual air temperature: 47 to 54 degrees F.
Frost free season: 125 to 165 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bankard, Glenberg, and Limon soils.  Bankard and Glenberg soils average less than 18 percent clay in the series control section.  Limon soils average more than 35 percent clay in the series control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; low runoff; moderate or moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used as native rangeland and irrigated cropland.  Native vegetation is mainly blue grama, western wheatgrass, galleta, alkali sacaton, and fourwing saltbush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern Colorado; LRR: G, MLRA 69.  This soil is of moderate extent.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic features in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 14 inches.
Organic carbon: irregular decrease with depth.
Ustic-Aridic moisture regime.

Remarks: The Haversid series replaces the Haverson series in the Ustic-Aridic moisture regime.  The Haverson series was reclassified from an Ustic Torrifluvents to Aridic Ustifluvents.  The name Haversid is coined from Haverson dry.
