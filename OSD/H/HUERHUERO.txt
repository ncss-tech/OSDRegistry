HUERHUERO SERIES

The Huerhuero series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from material weathering from sandstone and other sedimentary rocks. Huerhuero soils are on old alluvial fans and marine terraces and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 305 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 17 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, thermic Typic Natrixeralfs
