HARROUN SERIES

The Harroun series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained, moderately permeable soils on hillsides and cuestas.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium with some loess influence.  Slopes are 4 to 20 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the average annual temperature is about 7.2 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid, shallow Typic Durixerepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Harroun stony silt loam - rangeland.  On a 6 percent smooth slope, west aspect, 1,830 meters elevation.  (The soil was dry when described on August 5, 1980.  Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 10 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak very thick platy structure parting to weak fine and very fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; slightly effervescent; 2 percent stones; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 15 cm think)

    Bw--10 to 28 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very cobbly silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; 5 percent stones, 10 percent cobbles and 30 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 20 cm thick)

    Bk--28 to 41 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very cobbly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common gravel sized pan fragments; violently effervescent; 5 percent stones, 10 percent cobbles and 20 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (15 to 30 cm thick)

    Bkqm--41 to 56 cm; fractured carbonate-silica cemented hardpan (fractures more than 10 cm apart); massive; abrupt wavy boundary.  (5 to 38 cm thick)

    C--56 to 100 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very cobbly loam, pale brown (10 YR 6/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; violently effervescent; 15 percent cobbles and 20 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Cassia County, Idaho; about 1,000 feet west and 2,600 feet south of the northeast corner, sec. 24, T. 11 S., R. 25 E.; USGS Idahome 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 42 degrees 27 minutes 08 seconds N and longitude 113 degrees 28 minutes 34 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 42.4522222 latitude, -113.4761111longitude.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in this family

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Harroun soils are on hillsides and cuestas.  Slopes range from 4 to 20 percent.  Elevation ranges from 1,525 to 1,830 meters.  They formed in mixed alluvium with some loess influence.  The average annual precipitation is about 300 to 410 mm, and the average annual temperature is about 6.1 to 7.2 degrees C.  The frost-free season is about 85 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Rexburg and Watercanyon soils.  Rexburg and Watercanyon soils are very deep and have a coarse silty control section.  Rexburg soils are on north-facing hillsides.  Watercanyon soils are on cuestas and hillsides at higher elevations than Harroun soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; moderate saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used primarily for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The potential natural vegetation is black sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Sandburg bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Idaho.  The series is inextensive. MLRA 25 and 28A.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Cassia County, Idaho, 1986.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 18 cm (A and part of the Bw horizons).
Calcic horizon - The zone from 28 to 41 cm (Bk horizon).

Duripan - The zone from 41 to 56 cm (Bkqm horizon).

Particle-size control section - the zone from 25 to 41 cm (Part of the Bw horizon and the Bk horizon).

The classification is based on "Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eighth Edition, 1998".  The Bw in this pedon meets the definition of a cambic, however, the cambic is not diagnostic for the series.  The CCE range for the series needs to be established.
