HOOVERTON SERIES

The Hooverton series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on canyon sides.  They formed in colluvium from basalt.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slope ranges from 35 to 75 percent.  The average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 26 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hooverton stony loam -- on a 52 percent west-facing slope at 3,980 feet elevation in native grassland.  When described on October 7, 1991, the soil was dry throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated).

    A--0 to 11 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) stony loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; strong fine and medium granular structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine and few medium roots throughout; common fine and very fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel, 3 percent cobbles, 3 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary (4 to 12 inches thick).

    BA--11 to 17 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) very cobbly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic;  common fine and very fine roots throughout; common fine and very fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary (0 to 8 inches thick).

    Bt1--17 to 26 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) very cobbly clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; few fine roots matted around rock fragments;  many very fine tubular pores; very few faint patchy clay films on faces of peds; 15 percent gravel, 40 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.8);  clear wavy boundary.

    Bt2--26 to 35 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) extremely cobbly clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots matted around rock fragments; common very fine tubular pores; very few faint patchy clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent gravel, 60 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary (combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 10 to 28 inches).

    R--35 inches; fractured basalt.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Baboon, Badge, Collard, Dixiejet, Goodnoe, Kusshi, Phys, Ridd, and Whitinger soils. Baboon and Whitinger soils have 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Badge soils are deep or very deep to bedrock. Collard, Kusshi, and Phys soils are very deep. Dixiejet soils are deep to a lithic contact. Goodnoe soils are dry for 90 to 105 days following the summer solstice.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hooverton soils are on south- and west-facing canyon sides.  Slopes range from  35 to 75 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium from basalt with some minor additions of loess and volcanic  ash in the upper part.  Elevations are 2,800 to 5,300 feet.  Average annual precipitation is 22 to 28 inches, average annual temperature is 44 to 50 degrees F., and the frost free period is 70 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Klickson and Kettenbach series.  Klickson soils are greater than 60 inches deep, have less than 75 percent base saturation in some part, and are on north- and east-facing canyon sides.  Kettenbach soils have a thick mollic epipedon  and are on south- and west-facing canyon sides at lower elevations.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate to very rapid runoff;  moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for wildlife habitat and livestock grazing.  Native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, arrowleaf balsamroot, and silky lupine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  This soil is moderately extensive in the canyons of north-central Idaho.
