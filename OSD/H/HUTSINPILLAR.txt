HUTSINPILLAR SERIES

The Hutsinpillar series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils in depressions in drainageways, alluvial fans, and uplifted marine terraces. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources. Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1780 millimeters (70 inches). Mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).

Soil Moisture: The soil is usually moist in all parts of the soil moisture control section between the depths of 10 to 30 centimeters (4 to 12 inches) in most years, and is saturated in some parts during the months of December through April. The soils have an aquic soil moisture regime.

Soil Temperature: The mean annual soil temperature at 50 centimeters (20 inches) is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). The difference between average summer and winter soil temperatures is 2 to 4 degrees C.  The soils have an isomesic soil temperature regime.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Chetco series. Chetco soils have silt loam or silty clay loam surface textures and a C horizon with massive structure within the particle size control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hutsinpillar soils are on depressions in drainageways, alluvial fans, and uplifted marine terraces. Slopes are 0 to 9 percent. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources. Elevation is 4 to 134 meters (10 to 440 feet). The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1520 to 2030 millimeters (60 to 80 inches). Mean annual air temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). The mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C. The mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C. The frost free season is about 275 to 325 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aubell, Talawa, and Timmons soils.  Aubell soils are somewhat poorly drained with redoximorphic features greater than 25 centimeters from the soil surface.  Talawa soils are coarse-loamy with less than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Timmons soils are fine-loamy with less than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section.  The Aubell soils are on dissected fan remnants generally above the Huntsinpillar soils.  The Talawa and Timmons soils are on dissected marine terrace remnants.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained; very high runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity; rare flooding; frequent ponding.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for pasture and wildlife habitat. The natural vegetation is coast redwood, Sitka Spruce, with California huckleberry, cascara, salmonberry, deerfern, and western swordfern.  Some areas have been cleared for pastureland have existing vegetation of perennial grasses, rushes, and sedges.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coastal Redwood Belt; MLRA 4B. The series is not extensive.
