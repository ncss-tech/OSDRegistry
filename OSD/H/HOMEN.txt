HOMEN SERIES

The Homen series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in Peoria loess, Peoria and Roxana loess, or in loess and the underlying mix of Roxana loess and glacial drift on till plains. Slopes range from 2 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series for Homen in the same family classification.  Rend soils are in a closely related classification and have a (Btx) horizon with fragic soil properties, but have lower clay activity in the control section.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Homen soils are on gently sloping to strongly sloping convex summits, shoulders, and backslopes on till plains or ground moraines. Slope ranges from 2 to 18 percent. These soils formed in either Peoria loess, Peoria and Roxana loess (also called Roxana Silt), or in loess and the underlying mix of Roxana loess and glacial drift.  Mean annual temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C (54 to 57 degrees F), mean annual precipitation is 91 to 107 cm (36 to 42 inches), frost-free period is 170 to 200 days, and elevation is 107 to 244 meters (350 to 800 feet) above sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bunkum, Marine, Oconee, Pierron, and Ruma soils. The somewhat poorly drained Bunkum soils are on slopes of upland drainage ways below the Homen soils. The somewhat poorly drained, fine-textured Marine soils are on less sloping summits. The somewhat poorly drained Oconee soils have a dark surface layer, are fine-textured, and are farther from the drainage ways. The poorly drained, fine-textured Pierron soils are on nearly level interfluves or in slight depressions. The well drained Ruma soils are on convex slopes above the Homen soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained; A perched, seasonal water table is at a depth of 46 to 107 centimeters (1.5 to 3.5 feet) from January through April in most years. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (1.41 to 14.11 micrometers/sec) above horizons with fragic soil properties and moderately low to moderately high (0.42 to 4.23 micrometers/sec) in and below horizons with fragic soil properties. Permeability is moderate or moderately slow above horizons with fragic soil properties and is slow within horizons with fragic soil properties and moderately slow below. The potential for surface runoff is medium to high.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cropped to corn, soybeans, and wheat. A few areas are pastured or wooded. Native vegetation is deciduous trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwestern Illinois. Extent is large, mainly in MLRA 114B and to a lesser extent in MLRAs 108B and 115C.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Randolph County, Illinois, 1997.

REMARKS: During the initial soil surveys (1970s thru 1990s) of Bond, Jackson, Madison, Monroe, Perry, Randolph, St. Clair and Washington Counties, Homen soils were correlated as either the Hosmer series (Oxyaquic Fragiudalfs), the Muren series (Aquic Hapludalfs), or the Rozetta series (Oxyaquic Hapludalfs).

1997-1998 (RAL-GRS) Homen series was established and classified as (Oxyaquic Hapludalfs) in Randolph County.

In 2009, because of  brittleness described in Hosmer typical pedons from Madison, Perry, Randolph and Washington Counties initial soil survey reports and in a 2007 description of the OSD site,  classification is revised to (Fragic Oxyaquic Hapludalfs).

Brittleness was also described as an inclusion in the Rozetta 279B (Madison Co. Soil Survey Report 1986) and Muren 453B map unit descriptions (Monroe Co. Soil survey Report 1987)

In addition to typical pedons in county soil survey reports other pedons previously described as Hosmer which are located within the Homen geographical extent include:

59IL117001         80IL145009       80IL157129
59IL135002         80IL157128       

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 36 cm (14 inches), Ap1, Ap2 and E horizons.
Argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 36 to 234 cm (14 to 92 inches), Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Btx1, 2Btx2, 2Bt'1 and 2Bt'2 horizons.
Fragic Soil Properties  106 to 196 cm (42 to 77 inches), Btx1 and 2Btx2 horizons.
