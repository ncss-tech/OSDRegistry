SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Knott County, Kentucky, 1997

REMARKS:  
Handshoe soils were previously mapped as Dekalb, Hazleton, Muskingum, and Berks series.
Revised: 7/98-JDM, DHK; 2/2002-ABJ, DHK 
The 2/2001 revision expands the lower slope limit from 20 to 15 percent and changes the MAP from 40 to about 46 inches. Competing series were also revised. 
The 4/2005 revision changed the L horizon to an Oi and incorporated this horizon into the series control section.
The 7/2005 revision corrected minor grammatical errors.
The 2014 revision updates all text to semitabular format and converts most data to metric equivalents.
Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 16 inches (Oi, A & E horizons)
Cambic horizon--the zone from 16 to 68 inches (Bw and BC horizons)
Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Series control section--the zone from 10 to 30 inches

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Characterization data is available from the KSSL for the following pedons: 
Reference sample S94KY-119-6 (typical pedon).
