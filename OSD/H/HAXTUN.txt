HAXTUN SERIES

The Haxtun series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in polylithologic parent materials consisting of sandy eolian sediment overlying an old buried soil surface.  Haxtun soils are on drainageways, slightly depressed areas on plains, or table lands and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 43 centimeters (17 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C. (49 degrees F.) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Pachic Argiustolls

  BCb--99 to 119 centimeters (39 to 47 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist and dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist and crushed; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocks; slightly hard; very friable; slightly sticky, slightly plastic; 40 percent of horizon has streaks of brown (10YR 5/3) moist; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 30 centimeters (4 to 12 inches) thick)

  C--119 to 137 centimeters (47 to 54 inches); very pale brown (10YR 7/3) sandy loam, brown 5/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocks; soft, very friable; neutral; clear wavy boundary. (10 to 20 centimeters (4 to 8 inches) thick)

  2Ck--137 to 168 centimeters (54 to 66 inches); pink (7.5YR 7/4) gravelly sandy clay loam; brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable; visible calcium carbonates as concretions and in finely divided forms; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Albinas, Bluewater, Farnum, Funmar, Garrett, Jarita, Keya, Ownyate, Prosper, Renner, Sampson, Tracylee, Vosburg and Wetterdon series.
Bluewater soils contain redoximorphic features at 58 to 130 centimeters (23 to 51 inches).
