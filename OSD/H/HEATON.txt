HEATON SERIES

The Heaton series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in locally reworked eolian sands over sandy and loamy alluvium. These nearly level to moderately sloping soils occur on stream terraces on river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 828 mm (33 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C (65 degrees F).

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Parker County, Texas; 1972.

REMARKS: The series was formerly included in the Dougherty or Nimrod series. The series was separated based on mineralogy and wetness.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: 76 to 126 cm (30 to 50 in) (Bt1 horizon)

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 76 cm (0 to 30 in) (A and E horizons)
Argillic horizon - 76 to 229 cm (30 to 90 in) (Bt horizons)
Abrupt textural change: 76 cm (30 in) (top of Bt horizons)
Albic materials: 152 to 198 cm (60 to 78 in) (Bt2 and Bt3 horizons)

Additional comments: The Heaton series was proposed in Gillespie County, Texas; however, it was not correlated in the county. The type location was moved to Parker County. Mineralogy was checked at the South Regional Technical Service Center at Fort Worth, Texas.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area
