HORSELAKE SERIES

The Horselake series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and residuum derived from shale.  Horselake soils are on low shale hills.  Slopes range from 1 to 10 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Torrertic Haplustalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Horselake loam, on a north facing, convex, 3 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 7,350 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on July 7, 1999 the soil was slightly moist from 3 to 36 inches.

Precipitation pattern: Precipitation falls mostly during the months of November through March and July through October.  June is the driest month.  Total snowfall averages about 3 to 4 feet with snowmelt lasting into April.
Frost-free period: 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Menefee, Suposo, Wilmac series. The Menefee soils are shallow and are on backslopes and ridges. The Suposo soils are very deep and are in valleys.  Wilmac soils are on similar positions and have less than 45 percent clay.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES PROPOSED:  Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, Jicarilla Apache Area, Parts of Rio Arriba and Sandoval Counties Soil Survey.  The name Horselake is taken from a local lake.

REMARKS: 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section:  The zone from 3 to 23 inches.  (Bt, Btss1, Btss2, Btk horizons)

Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 3 inches.  (A horizon)

Argillic horizon:  The zone from 3 to 31 inches.  (Bt, Btss1, Btss2, Btk horizons)

Paralithic contact:  The contact with shale at 36 inches.  (Cr horizon)

Vertic features: slickensides, cracks, and COLE of 0.06 to 0.09 between the surface and the paralithic contact.

Other features:  carbonate, gypsum and pH increase with proximity to shale.  

Remarks:  

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

Taxonomic Version:  Eighth Edition, 1998

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Lincoln Lab characterization samples taken within a Horselake mapunit S90NM-039-003, originally sampled as Rombo, and COLE samples S99-039-003 taken at this pedon from 14 to 22 inches.
