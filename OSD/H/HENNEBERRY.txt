HENNEBERRY SERIES

The Henneberry series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from red limestone conglomerate or other red calcareous rock types. These soils are on ridges, hills and mountain slopes. Slopes are 15 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic Lithic Calcicryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Henneberry very gravelly loam, in rangeland, on a 25 percent slope at an elevation of 1920 meters. (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted) 

  A--0 to 13 cm; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) very gravelly loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and medium granular structure, slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 30 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 15 cm thick)

  Bk1--13 to 36 cm; red (2.5YR 5/6) very gravelly loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 30 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; finely disseminated calcium carbonate and discontinuous calcium carbonate casts on fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary.

  Bk2--36 to 48 cm; light red (2.5YR 6/6) very gravelly loam, red (2.5YR 5/6) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 45 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; finely disseminated calcium carbonate and discontinuous calcium carbonate casts on fragments; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual wavy boundary. (combined thickness of Bk horizons - 15 to 42 cm)

  R--48 to 152 cm; red limestone conglomerate of the Beaverhead formation.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform - ridges, hills and mountain slopes 
Elevation - 1825 to 2600 meters
Slope - 10 to 60 percent
Parent material - colluvium and residuum derived from red limestone conglomerate or other red calcareous rock types 
Climate - long, cold winters; cool, moist springs; cool summers 
Mean annual precipitation - 380 to 610 mm

Frost-free period - 50 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Henneberry soils are used for rangeland. Potential native vegetation is mainly Idaho Fescue, artemisia species, bluebunch wheatgrass, bitterroot, lupine and green rabbitbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Henneberry soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.  MLRA - 43B.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Horse Prairie-South Valley Area - Part of Beaverhead County, Montana, 2011; proposed in Beaverhead County, Montana, 2008.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 13 cm (A horizon)
Calcic horizon from 13 to 48 cm, (Bk1, Bk2 horizons)
Particle-size control section - from 25 to 48 cm (part of the Bk1, Bk2 horizons)
Lithic contact - at 48 cm (R horizon)

Henneberry soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
