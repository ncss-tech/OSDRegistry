HUFMAN SERIES

The Hufman series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in fibrous peat over loamy alluvium.  Hufman soils are in cutoff meanders and depressions on stream terraces and palsas.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 26 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 16 inches. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, euic Terric Cryofibrists

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hufman peat on a level slope under sedge meadow vegetation at 1900 feet elevation.  (colors are squeezed for organic and wet for mineral soil)

    Oi1--0 to 9 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/6, squeezed) fibrous sedge peat; slightly decomposed sedge fibers; about 95 percent fibers unrubbed, 85 percent fibers rubbed; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual wavy boundary. (6 to 14 inches thick)

    Oi2--9 to 26 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4, squeezed) fibrous sedge peat; slightly decomposed sedge fibers; about 90 percent fibers unrubbed, 80 percent fibers rubbed; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (10 to 26 inches thick)

    Cg1--26 to 34 inches; dark greenish gray (5GY 4/1); silt loam; massive; very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; reduced matrix; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual wavy boundary. (6 to 20 inches thick)

    Cg2=34 to 60 inches; dark greenish gray (5GY 4/1); stratified fine sand through silt with composite texture of loam; massive; very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; reduced matrix; slightly acid (pH 6.4).


TYPE LOCATION:  Gulkana River Area, main stem, Alaska;  about 2 miles (3 kilometers) northwest of Sourdough; the SW1/4 of the NE1/4 of section 23, T.9N., R.2W., Copper River Meridian.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the mineral underlying material ranges from 16 to 40 inches.  The water table is at or near the surface from May through September.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.  


The O horizons have hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR; value moist of 2.5 or 3; chroma moist of 3 through 6.  

The Cg horizons have hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, 5GY or 5G; value moist of 3 through 5; chroma moist of 1 or 2.  The texture is stratified fine sand through silt with composite texture of fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing soils in the same family or subgroup.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Hufman soils are in cutoff meanders and depressions on stream terraces.  The soils formed in fibrous sedge peat over loamy alluvial sediments.  The climate is subarctic continental with an average annual
precipitation of about 16 inches.  Mean annual temperature
is 26 degrees F.  Slopes range are commonly less than 1 percent. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained.  Ponded to very slow runoff.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the organic materials and moderate in the mineral underlying material. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  The Hufman soils are used for wildlife habitat and recreation.  The native vegetation is dominantly sedge meadow. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Copper River Basin, Alaska.  The series is of moderate extent.
