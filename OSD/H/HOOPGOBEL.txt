HOOPGOBEL SERIES

The Hoopgobel series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium over weakly consolidated ash, tuffaceous siltstone or tuffaceous sandstone.  These soils are on hillslopes and mountain slopes on north-facing aspects.  Permeability is moderately slow. Slopes are 15 to 35 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.   

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Pachic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:   Hoopgobel loam, rangeland; on a 22 percent slope at an elevation of 6,200 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

(4 to 5 inches thick)

    AB--4 to 9 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt1--9 to 18 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; strong medium angular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; common faint continuous clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 9 inches thick)

    Bt2--18 to 24 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; strong medium prismatic structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; common distinct continuous clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 15 percent gravel and 5 percent paragravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)

    Btk--24 to 28 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) paragravelly clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common faint discontinuous clay films on faces of peds and in pores; lime is present as thin coats on bottoms of paragravels; 15 percent paragravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)

    2Cr--28 to 60 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/1) weakly consolidated ash; some lime in upper platy cracks.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bachus, Bavdark, Benteen, Brushtop (T), Clayburn, Croydon, Crystalbutte, Davtone, Dehana, Demast, Dranburn, Dranyon, Echemoor, Hagenbarth, Millerlake, Odark (T), Pontuge, Senchert, Southmount, Poodle, Stubbs, Thulepah, Vadnais, and Winu series. Bachus, Benteen, Echemor, Senchert, Vadnais and Winu soils are 20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact.  Brushtop soils are 40 to 60 inches to a paralithic contact.  Odark soils are very deep. Poodle soils do not have a Btk horizon and have average annual soil temperature of 43 to 47 degrees F. Stubbs soils are in an ustic moisture regime. Poodle soils lack paragravels consisting of weakly consolidated ash.  Bavdark, Clayburn, Crystalbutte, Davtone, Dehana, Demast, Dranburn, Hagenbarth, Millerlake, Pontuge, Southmount, and Thulepah soils are very deep.  Croydon and Dranyon soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform: hillslopes and mountain slopes on north-facing aspects
Elevation: 6,000 to 7,150 feet
Slope: 10 to 40 percent
Parent Material: alluvium over weakly consolidated ash, tuffaceous siltstone, or tuffaceous sandstone
Climate: long, cool winters; dry, warm summers
Average annual precipitation: 14 to 22 inches
Average annual temperature: 37 to 43 degrees F.
Frost-free season: 50 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brushtop (T), Cadero (T), and Redpine (T) soils.   Brushtop soils are 40 to 60 inches to a paralithic contact on north-facing slopes.  Cadero soils are shallow to weakly consolidated ash on shoulders and summits.  Redpine soils have a warmer soil temperature regime on mostly west-facing backslopes and shoulders.   

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderately slow permeability

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for wildlife habitat and rangeland.  The dominant native vegetation is mountain big sagebrush, common snowberry, serviceberry, Idaho fescue, bluegrass, prairie junegrass, and common yarrow.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Idaho. The soils are not extensive.
