HARL SERIES

The Harl series consists of very deep, well drained soils on side slopes of plateaus, canyons and mountains. Harl soils formed in volcanic ash over colluvium derived from basalt. Slopes are 30 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.
