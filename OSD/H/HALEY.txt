HALEY SERIES

The Haley series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed volcanic ash over glacial outwash.  They are on outwash terraces and terrace escarpments. Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Vitrandic Haploxerolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Haley ashy fine sandy loam, cultivated. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

  Ap--0 to 8 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) ashy fine sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many roots; many fine pores; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 9 inches thick) 

  A--8 to 12 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) ashy fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many roots; many fine pores; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 7 inches thick) 

  Bw--12 to 25 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) ashy fine sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak medium prismatic structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common roots; common fine pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (11 to 17 inches thick) 

  2C--25 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; single-grained; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few roots; neutral (pH 7.0). 

TYPE LOCATION: Okanogan County, Washington; 1,000 feet south and 300 feet east of the northwest corner of sec. 32, T.37N., R.28E. (Latitude 48 degrees, 39 minutes 57.90 seconds North, Longitude 119 degrees, 20 minutes, 23.58 seconds West NAD 83).

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil moisture: usually moist but are dry for 90 to 105 consecutive days following summer solstice; xeric soil moisture regime.

Soil temperature: mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 55 degrees F.  

Rock fragments:  0 to 10 percent in the particle-size control section.

Depth to contrasting sandy material: 20 to 30 inches. 

Vitrandic soil properties: upper 20 to 30 inches of the profile has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.40 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples

Mollic epipedon: 10 to 16 inches thick. 

A horizon
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3 dry or moist
Gravel: 0 to 10 percent

Bw horizon

2C horizon
Value: 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist
Chroma: 2 through 4 dry or moist
Texture: sand, coarse sand and loamy sand
Gravel: 0 to 15 percent

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Cheney series.  The Cheny soils  are dry for 70 to 95 days and the lower part of the particle-size  control section has 35 to 90 percent rock fragments (sandy-skeletal). 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Haley soils are on outwash terraces and terrace escarpments.  Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent.  These soils formed in mixed volcanic ash over glacial outwash.  Elevations are 1,400 to 3,800 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 11 to 15 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 71 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 110 to 150 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Conconully, Disautel, Ewall, Fivelakes, Hobohill, Nespelem, and Owhi soils. Hobohill soils have a sandy particle-size control section. Conconully and Disautel soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the control section and have a densic contact. Ewall soils are sandy throughout the profile. Fivelakes and Owhi soils are sandy-skeletal in the lower part of the particle-size control section. Nespelem soils are coarse-silty and have a duripan. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, slow to rapid runoff; moderately rapid permeability in the solum and very rapid in the substratum. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Orchards, irrigated hay and pasture, irrigated and dryland cropland, livestock grazing, and wildlife habitat are the principal uses. Native vegetation is bluebunch wheatgrass, needleandthread, Sandberg bluegrass, yarrow, arrowleaf balsamroot, hood phlox, antelope bitterbrush, silky lupine. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North-central Washington; MLRA 8. The series is of small extent.
