HUSSMAN SERIES

The Hussman series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Hussman soils are on low stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, smectitic, mesic Torrertic Haploxerolls

COMPETING SERIES:  At present, there are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hussman soils are on low stream terraces.  They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,400 to 1,465 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Gardnerville soil.  Gardnerville soils have ochric epipedons, albic horizons, natric horizons, and horizons with durinodes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained; high surface runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 76 and 122 meters (moderately deep and deep free water occurrence classes) from December through May.  Cumulative annual duration classes are Common or Persistent.  These soils are susceptible to rare flooding for very brief periods year-round or occasional flooding for brief periods from December to March.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Hussman soils are used for irrigated cropland and livestock grazing.  Common crops are alfalfa hay, small grains, and grass-legume pasture.  Vegetation in rangeland is mainly basin big sagebrush and grass with black greasewood and inland saltgrass in saline-sodic areas.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  These soils are not extensive with about 1,800 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 26.

REMARKS:  The 04/2000 revision updated the taxonomic subgroup from Fluvaquentic to Torrertic Haploxerolls.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 30 cm (Ap and A horizons).
Identifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 30 to 107 cm (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons).
Linear extensibility feature - Based on smectitic clay mineralogy and high shrink-swell potential, an assumed sum of 6 to 9 cm exists from the soil surface to 100 cm (Ap, A, and Bk1 horizons and part of the Bk2 horizon).
Endosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 76 and 122 cm at certain times in normal years (parts of the Bk2, C1, and C2 horizons).
Particle size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Bk1 horizon and parts of the A and Bk2 horizons).
