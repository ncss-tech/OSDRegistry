HATERMUS SERIES

Typically, Hatermus soils have light gray friable calcareous loam A1 horizons and very strongly alkaline C horizons having accumulation of secondary calcium carbonate.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid, shallow Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hatermus clay loam - rangeland. (Colors are for air dry unless otherwise noted.)

     A1--0 to 1 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; weak thin platy structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; calcareous; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick)

     C1--1 to 10 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, sticky, plastic; very few fine roots; strongly calcareous; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); gradual wavy boundary (5 to 10 inches thick).

     C2ca--10 to 18 inches; light olive gray (5Y 6/2) loam, olive gray (5Y 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, sticky, plastic; strongly calcareous, many fine and medium threads seams and nests of secondary lime; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.4); clear smooth boundary (5 to 10 inches thick).

     C3--18 inches +; soft, light gray, very strongly alkaline, calcareous, platy shale.

TYPE LOCATION:  Sublette County, Wyoming.  Center of Sec. 29, T31N, R108W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 36 to 47 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 62 degrees F.  Depth to very strongly alkaline shale is 10 to 20 inches.  The soils are calcareous throughout.  The ca horizons have less than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  The control section has more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium.  It commonly is loam averaging between 18 and 27 percent clay.  Some pedons are very fine sandy loam or clay loam.   It is strongly alkaline in the upper part and very strongly alkaline in the lower part.  Coarse shale fragments less than one-half inch in size are 5 percent or less.  The A and C horizons have hue of 5Y through 10YR; value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist; and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the tentative Coaldraw, tentative Haterton, tentative Horsely, and tentative Huguston series.  The Coaldraw series has less than 15 percent exchangeable sodium and has bedded gypsiferous shale at 10 to 20 inches.  Haterton soils have less than 15 percent exchangeable sodium.  Horsely soils have less than 15 percent exchangeable sodium and shale at depths of less than 10 inches.  Huguston soils have less than 15 percent exchangeable sodium and less than 18 percent clay in the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hatermus soils are on upland ridges and upper slopes of hillsides.  Slopes are 10 to 30 percent.  They formed in residuum weathered from very strongly alkaline shale.  Mean annual temperature is 34 to 45 degrees F.  Precipitation is 6 to 9 inches.  Elevation is 6,000 to 7,000 feet.  The growing season is 80 to 110 days, but frost may occur in any month.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the tentative Fraddle and tentative Haterton soils.  Fraddle soils have argillic horizons and are on the lower slopes of hillsides.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation is needleleaf sedge.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Wyoming.  The series is inextensive.

REMARKS:
The superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.
