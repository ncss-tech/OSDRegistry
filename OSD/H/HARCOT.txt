HARCOT SERIES

The Harcot series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of alluvium and in the underlying sandy and gravelly outwash.  These soils are on slightly concave to slightly convex positions on treads on stream terraces and on flood plains in river valleys and on outwash plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 740 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.

Coland--are in slightly lower landscape positions on floodplains and have a sand content that averages less than 15 to 30 percent in the particle-size control section
Dickinson--are on higher landscape positions and are not frequently saturated within a depth of 1.8 meters during the wettest periods of years when the precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Lawler--are on slightly higher landscape positions and do not have carbonates in the series control section
Marshan--are on landscape positions similar to those of the Harcot soils and do not have carbonates within a depth of 100 centimeters

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class--poorly drained--these soils have a frequently saturated zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 0.3 meter during the wettest periods of years when the precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation and this saturation is considered apparent
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--1.0 to 10.0 micrometers per second in the alluvium and 100 to 705 micrometers per second in the underlying outwash
Flooding--not flooded to rarely flooded for brief duration

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Where artificially drained, Harcot soils are cultivated.  The principal crops are corn and soybeans.  Undrained areas are pastured or wildlife land.  The native vegetative cover is a herbaceous wetland community commonly inhabited with Bluejoint Grasses, Fowl Bluegrasses, Green Muhlies, Fox Sedges, Field Sedges, Dudleys Rushes, Torreys Rushes, Swamp Milkweeds, False Sneezeweeds, False Asters, New England Asters, White Panicled Asters, and Wild Mints.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Worth County, Iowa, 1972.

REMARKS: 
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include: 
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 51 centimeters (Apk, Ak, and ABk horizons);
calcic horizon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 61 centimeters (Apk, Ak, ABk, and Bkg horizons);
aquic moisture regime.

Aquic subgroup based on low chroma matrix of the zone from a depth of 51 to 61 centimeters (Bkg horizon). 

Differentia between Harcot series and Arlo series needs further study.

Cation-exchange class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
