HOGCREEK SERIES

The Hogcreek series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in hillslope sediments mixed with a component of loess and the underlying colluvium. These soils are on gently sloping to moderately sloping ridgetops. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, siliceous, active, mesic Typic Fragiudults

TYPICAL PEDON: Hogcreek silt loam - on a north facing convex ridgetop of 3 percent slope in a fescue and red clover pasture at an elevation of 1,150 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

  Ap--0 to 4 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; very friable; many fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; 5 percent chert gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick)

  Bt1--4 to 9 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine and few medium roots; common fine irregular and few fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; common distinct pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay depletions on surfaces of peds; 7 percent chert gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary.

  Bt2--9 to 19 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) silt loam; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; many fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent chert gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.3); clear smooth boundary.

  Bt3--19 to 27 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) silt loam; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; few fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) masses of iron accumulation; 7 percent chert gravel; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); clear smooth boundary.

  Bt4--27 to 32 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly silt loam; moderate medium angular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; common very fine tubular and few medium vesicular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and in pores; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) masses of iron accumulation; 30 percent gravel; very strongly acid (pH 4.8); clear wavy boundary. (combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 13 to 28 inches)

  2Btx--32 to 39 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) and brown (10YR 5/3) extremely gravelly silt loam; weak very coarse prismatic structure parting to strong medium angular blocky; very firm; common medium tubular and few medium vesicular pores; common prominent clay films on faces of peds; 70 percent gravel; about 75 percent brittleness; very strongly acid (pH 4.9); abrupt wavy boundary. (7 to 14 inches thick)

  3R--39 inches; chert bedrock from the Roubidoux formation.

TYPE LOCATION: Texas County, Missouri; about 1 mile northwest of Slabtown; 500 feet south and 2,050 feet east of the NW corner of section 16, T. 33 N., R. 10 W; Slabtown Spring, Missouri USGS quadrangle; latitude 37 degrees 34 minutes 21 seconds N. and longitude 92 degrees 02 minutes 25 seconds W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Depth to bedrock:    20 to 40 inches

3R horizon           chert, sandstone, or orthoquartzose.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Laidig and Yelton series. These soils do not have a lithic contact within 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hogcreek soils are on gently to moderately sloping ridgetops. These soils formed in hillslope sediments mixed with a component of loess and in the underlying colluvium. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bendavis, Bender, Poynor, and Viburnum soils. Bendavis and Bender soils have more rock fragments in the profile and are on shoulder slopes. Poynor and Viburnum soils are very deep and are on similar positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. Runoff is medium to very high. Permeability is moderate above the fragipan and slow in the fragipan. The saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high above the fragipan, and low in the fragipan.  A zone of water saturation is from 1.5 to 2.5 feet (immediately above the fragipan) for brief periods in most years.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used mainly for hay and pasture. Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods and shortleaf pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Ozark Highland region (MLRA 116A) of south central Missouri. The series is of moderate extent.
