HINGHAM SERIES

The Hingham series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian, glaciolacustrine, or alluvium deposits.  These soils are on till plains and lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hingham loam, in cropland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 7 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak very fine subangular structure; soft, very friable, sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; common very fine pores; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw--7 to 14 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 9 inches thick)

    Bk1--14 to 22 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) silt loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine pores; few fine seams of lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (7 to 22 inches thick)

    Bk2--22 to 35 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silt loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine pores; few fine seams of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. (11 to 24 inches thick)

    Bk3--35 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) very fine sandy loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine pores; few fine seams of lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Hill County, Montana; 500 feet north and 1,000 feet west of the SE corner of sec. 21, T. 32 N., R. 11 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil temperature - 42 to 47 degrees F.

Pedons that have an Ap horizon less than 7 inches thick have mollic epipedon when mixed to 7 inches.


Bw horizon - Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y

Value:  4, 5, or 6 dry; 3 or 4 moist

Chroma:  2, 3, or 4

Texture:  silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam

Clay content:  5 to 18 percent

Reaction:  pH 6.1 to 7.8


Bk horizons - Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y

Value:  5, 6, or 7 dry; 4 or 5 moist

Chroma:  2, 3, or 4

Calcium carbonate equivalent:  5 to 15 percent

Reaction:  pH 7.9 to 8.4

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - till plains and lake plains.

Elevation - 2,600 to 3,200 feet.

Slope - 0 to 8 percent.

Parent material - alluvium, glaciolacustrine, or eolian deposits.

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; hot, dry summers.

Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 14 inches, most of which falls during spring and early summer.

Mean annual air temperature - 42 to 45 degrees F.

Frost-free period - 105 to 120 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Hingham soils are used as nonirrigated cropland and rangeland.  The potential plant community is bluebunch wheatgrass, green needlegrass, needleandthread, and western wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Hingham soils are of small extent in north-central Montana.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Hill County, Montana, 1994; proposed in Hill County, Montana, 1991.  Hingham is the name of a town in Hill County, Montana.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1271.  The diagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon (mixed) from the surface to 7 inches (Ap horizon) and a cambic horizon from 7 to 14 inches (Bw horizon); and a horizon of secondary carbonate accumulation (Bk1, Bk2 horizons).  Hingham soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.
