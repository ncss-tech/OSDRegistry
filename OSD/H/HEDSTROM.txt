HEDSTROM SERIES

The Hedstrom series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium over sand.  These soils are on fans and terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hedstrom loam, in pasture.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap--0 to 7 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine angular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; soft, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 7 inches thick)

    Bt1--7 to 15 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate coarse angular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine pores; common thin clay films on faces of peds and in pores; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (6 to 9 inches thick)

    Bt2--15 to 22 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium coarse prismatic structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine pores; many thin clay films on faces of peds and in pores; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 14 inches thick)

    Bk--22 to 31 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine pores; many medium soft masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).  (5 to 10 inches thick)

    2C--31 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sand, brown
(10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; 5 percent pebbles; thin lime coatings on surface of pebbles; strongly effervescent; mildly alkaline (pH 7.8).

COMPETING SERIES:  The Turner series is the only competing series.  Turner soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the 2C horizon.  The Degrand series is closely similar and has an aridic moisture regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hedstrom soils are on fans and terraces.  Elevations are 2,540 to 3,500 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  These soils formed in mixed loamy alluvium and are 20 to 40 inches thick over sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand.  The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 90 to 110 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderate permeability in the A and B horizons and rapid permeability in the 2C horizon.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Hedstrom soils are used mainly as rangeland and for dryland crops.  The potential native vegetation is bluebunch wheatgrass, western wheatgrass, green needlegrass, needleandthread, and some forbs and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Hedstrom soils are of small extent in southeastern Montana.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES PROPOSED:  Prairie County, Montana, 1984.  Hedstrom is the name of a lake in Prairie County.

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretation Records:  MT0874.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 15 inches (Ap, Bt1 horizons); an argillic horizon from 7 to 22 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizons); a particle-size control section from 7 to 40 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bk, and 2C horizons).  Hedstrom soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
