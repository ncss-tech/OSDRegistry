Aello soils are poorly drained, lack a mineral contact within 70 cm of the soil surface, and occur on depressions in till plains.
Fields soils are well drained, lack permafrost, have an umbric epipedon, have a lithic contact within 2 m (79 in) of the soil surface, and occur on mountains.
Ironcreek soils are well drained, lack permafrost, and occur on river valleys and flood plains
Nathlie soils are poorly drained, do not have permafrost, have a histic epipedon, have a cambic horizon, and occur in river valleys terraces and lake plains.
Tok soils are well drained, have fine sandy loam cambic horizons over gravelly till, and occur on kames and glacial valley floors.
Tsina soils are well drained, do not have permafrost, and occur on mountain slopes above 800 m (2600ft) elevation.
