HARSLOW SERIES

The Harslow series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in loamy colluvium and residuum from basalt and other igneous and volcanic rock types. Harslow soils occur on summits, shoulder slopes, back slopes, and foot slopes of mountains. Slopes are 5 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 95 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Medial-skeletal, ferrihydritic, mesic Alic Hapludands 

TYPICAL PEDON: Harslow very gravelly medial loam--woodland. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.) 

   Oi--0 to 2 inches; needles, leaves, twigs, and roots. 

   A--2 to 13 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) very gravelly medial loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) dry; moderate very fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; weakly smeary; many very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; 35 percent gravel; strongly acid (pH.5.2); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 12 inches thick) 

   BA--13 to 20 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) very gravelly medial loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) dry; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; weakly smeary; many very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; 35 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 8 inches) 

   Bw--20 to 26 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/3) very cobbly medial loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) dry; moderate very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; weakly smeary; common very fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 20 percent gravel and 35 percent cobbles; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 15 inches thick) 

   BC--26 to 36 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/3) extremely gravelly medial loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) dry; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; weakly smeary; common very fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 55 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 15 inches thick) 

   R--36 inches; basalt. 

TYPE LOCATION: Clatsop County, Oregon; about one-half mile east of Spruce Run County Park, 100 feet north of the road on a steep slope in the SE 1/4 NW 1/4 section 19, T. 4 N., R. 7 W., W. M.; Elsie, OR USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle; NAD 1927. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is usually moist but is dry for a short period of less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 4 to 12 inches in the four month period following the summer solstice in most years. The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 55 degrees F. The particle-size control section has a clay content of 18 to 27 percent (field estimate), moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 g/cubic centimeter, greater than 85 percent phosphate retention, 2.0 to 4.0 percent acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron, 2.0 to 15 cmol/kg of KCL-extractable aluminum, and 15 to 30 percent 15-bar moisture (air dried). It has 35 to 85 rock fragments.  It is weakly or moderately smeary. The depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. Hue is typically 5YR or 7.5YR, but ranges to 10YR. Reaction is moderately acid to very strongly acid. 

The A horizon and AB horizon, when present, has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, and 2 to 4 dry. Texture is very gravelly medial loam or extremely gravelly medial loam with 15 to 25 percent clay by field estimate. It has 35 to 50 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles. 

The BA horizon, when present, has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry. Texture is very gravelly medial loam or extremely gravelly medial loam with 18 to 25 percent clay by field estimate. It has 35 to 50 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles. 

The Bw horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry. Texture is very gravelly medial loam, extremely gravelly medial loam, very cobbly medial loam, or extremely cobbly medial loam with 20 to 27 percent clay by field estimate. It has 20 to 70 percent gravel and 0 to 35 percent cobbles. 

The BC horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 6 dry. Texture is extremely gravelly medial loam or extremely cobbly medial loam with 15 to 25 percent clay by field estimate. It has 30 to 70 percent gravel and 0 to 35 percent cobbles. 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Alstony and Klistan series. Alstony and Klistan soils are over 40 inches deep to bedrock. Alstony soils have an ochric epipedon. Klistan soils have an umbric epipedon. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Harslow soils occur on summits, shoulder slopes, back slopes, and foot slopes of mountains. Elevations are 200 to 2250 feet. Slopes are 5 to 90 percent. The soils formed in loamy colluvium and residuum from basalt, coarse-grained igneous, and other volcanic rock types. The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 130 inches. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F. The frost-free period is 100 to 220 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Formader, Hemcross, Kilchis, and the competing Klistan soils. All these soils occur on mountains. Formader soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section, are 20 to 40 inches to paralithic contact, and have a strongly contrasting particle-size class (medial over loamy). Hemcross soils are more than 60 inches deep to bedrock and have less than 35 percent coarse fragments throughout the particle-size control section. Kilchis soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to a lithic contact. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, recreation, wildlife habitat, and watersheds. Native vegetation is Douglas fir, western hemlock, western redcedar, red alder, salal, vine maple, red huckleberry, western swordfern, western brackenfern, oceanspray, snowberry, and cascade Oregongrape. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coast Range Mountains in Oregon: MLRA 1. The soils are moderately extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Clatsop County, Oregon, 1984. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Umbric epipedon - from 2 to 13 inches (A horizon)
Cambic horizon - from 20 to 26 inches (Bw horizon) 
Andic soil properties - from 2 to 36 inches 
Particle-size control section - from 2 to 36 inches 

Depth to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral layer. 

Classification revised 8/01 by adding the ferrihydritic mineralogy class to the current classification. 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Reference samples collected and analysis run by OSU; when samples were collected, the soil was mapped Harrington.
