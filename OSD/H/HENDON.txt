HENDON SERIES

The Hendon series consists of deep, well drained, nearly level to sloping soils that formed in a loamy mantle 18 to 30 inches thick that is higher in silt content than the underlying loamy residuum that weathered from interbedded flat-lying sandstone, siltstone and shale.  These soils are on broad interfluves of the Cumberland Plateau and have a fragic layer in the subsoil.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, mesic Fragic Paleudults

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hendon silt loam on a 6 percent slope--woodland (colors are for moist soil)

    O--0 to 2 inches; partially decomposed and undecomposed pine needles and twigs.

    A--2 to 3 inch; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam; weak medium granular structure; friable; many fine and medium roots; very strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 2 inches thick)

    E--3 to 12 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam; moderate medium granular structure; friable; common fine and medium roots; very fine tubular pores; very strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary. (2 to 9 inches thick)

    Bt1--12 to 17 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) silt loam, weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine and medium roots; common fine and few medium tubular pores; few clay films on faces of peds and in pores; very strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary. (5 to 12 inches thick)

    Bt2--17 to 27 inches, yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) silt loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; common fine and few medium tubular pores; few clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 5 percent small pebbles in the lower part of this horizon; very strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (6 to 22 inches thick)

    2Btx/E--27 to 34 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) loam; common medium distinct yellowish red (5YR 5/8) mottles (B part); few very pale brown (10YR 7/3) pockets and coatings on the faces of most prisms (E part); weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak coarse platy and weak medium subangular blocky; firm; common fine tubular pores; few small pebbles in the upper 2 inches; 40 to 60 percent brittleness by volume; few strong brown clay films on faces of peds and in pores; very strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 16 inches thick)

    2Btx--34 to 46 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/8) loam, few medium distinct light olive brown (2.5YR 5/4) mottles; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak coarse platy and weak medium subangular blocky; firm; few fine tubular pores; 50 to 60 percent brittleness by volume; very pale brown coatings on prism faces; few strong brown clay films on faces of peds and in pores; very strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary. (10 to 22 inches thick)

    2Bt--46 to 67inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/8) loam; common medium distinct brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) and few fine faint strong brown mottles; moderate weak subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine tubular pores; few strong brown clay films on faces of peds; very strongly acid.

TYPE  LOCATION:  Bledsoe County, Tennessee, on Bakewell Road 1.5 miles east of the Hendon-Brayton Road, 100 feet north of road.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum and depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid except the surface layer is less acid in limed areas.  Fragments of sandstone and shale up to 1/2 inch across range from 0 to 5 percent in the A and upper part of the B horizon, and 0 to 10 percent in the lower part of the B horizon.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR, values of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2.  The E horizon or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, values of 5 or 6 and chromas of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam or loam.

A BE horizon is present in some pedons and has a hue of 10YR, value of 5 and chromas of 4 or 6.  Texture is silt loam or loam.

The Bt horizon and upper part of the 2Btx horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is silt loam loam, or clay loam.  The E part has hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7 and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is loam or silt loam.

The 2Btx and 2Bt horizons have hues of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, values of 4 or 5 and chroma of 6 or 8.  Texture is loam or clay loam.  Mottles in shades of brown, yellow, or red are present in the 2B horizons of most pedons.  Gray mottles occur in a few pedons below a depth of 30 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other soils in this family.  Similar soils in other families include Clarkrange, Dunlap, Lonewood, Shack and Tasso soils.  Clarkrange soils are fine-silty and have a fragipan.  Dunlap soils are on stream terraces and are thermic.  Shack and Tasso soils are thermic and contain chert fragments.  Lonewood soils do not have a fragic layer and have a thinner solum.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hendon soils are on broad smooth plateaus and ridgetops.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent.  These soils formed in a loamy mantle 18 to 30 inches thick that is higher in silt content than the underlying loamy residuum that weathered from interbedded flat-lying sandstone, siltstone and shale.  Near the type location, mean annual temperature is 55 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 53 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY  ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Lonewood series and the Lily and Ramsey series.  Lily soils are less than 40 inches to bedrock do not have a fragic layer.  Ramsey soils are commonly on steeper slopes, are less than 20 inches to bedrock and do not have an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately slow permeability in the 2Btx horizon and moderate in all other horizons.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of Hendon soils are in forest, but some areas are also used for hay' pasture and cultivated crops.  Forested areas consist chiefly of Oaks, hickories, shortleaf pine and loblolly pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Cumberland Plateau of Tennessee.  The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES PROPOSED:   Bledsoe County, Tennessee - 1985.

REMARKS:   Hendon soils were formerly included in the Lonewood series.  Laboratory data for the typical pedon was obtained from the National Soil Survey Laboratory: S84TN-007-007. Data is also available from the control section of two additional pedons:  S84TN-007-008 and S84TN-007-009.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface 01 the soil to a depth of approximately 10 inches (A, E horizons)

Argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 10 to 65 inches (Bt1 through 2Bt horizon)

Fragic feature - the zone with 40 to 60 percent brittleness from and 2Btx/E horizons)

2/2022 revision: Oi had 2 to 0 inch depths, corrected to be 0 to 2 in horizon depths then added 2 inches to all horizon depths throughout the typical pedon. WJN
