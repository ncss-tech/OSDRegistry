HUN SERIES

The Hun series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from granite with a mantle of volcanic ash.  These soils are on mountains and have slopes of 30 to 65 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 45 inches and average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Andic Dystrocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hun gravelly silt loam - on a north-facing slope of 35 percent, forested, at 4,640 feet elevation.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.  When described, the soil was dry throughout.)

    0i--0 to 1.5 inches; needles, leaves, twigs and cones.

    0e--1.5 to 2 inches; decomposed organic matter with discontinuous light gray (10YR 7/1) volcanic ash.

    Bw1--2 to 9 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure parting to strong fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, common medium and coarse roots; many very fine, fine, and common medium tubular pores; 25 percent pebbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary.  (7 to 12 inches thick)

    2Bw2--9 to 14 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, and common medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 35 percent pebbles and 15 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 7 inches thick)

    2Bw3--14 to 25 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly plastic; common very fine, fine, and few medium roots; many very fine and common fine tubular pores; 35 percent pebbles, 10 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary.  (9 to 11 inches thick)

    2C--25 to 55 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) extremely cobbly loamy sand, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 40 percent pebbles, 20 percent cobbles and 20 percent stones; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (15 to 30 inches thick)

    Cr--55 to 60 inches; fractured and weathered granite.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bordengulch, Goodlow, Growden, Rubycreek, Threebutte (T), Twentymile (T), Vandamine, and Venson (T) series. The Bordengulch, Threebutte, and Venson soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. The Goodlow, Growden, Rubycreek, Twentymile, and Vandamine soils are very deep. In addition the Goodlow soils have an umbric epipedon, the Growden soils have a xeric moisture regime, the Twentymile soils have dense till at 20 to 35 inches, and the Vandamine soils have 2Bt horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hun soils are on mountains and have slopes of 30 to 65 percent.  Elevations range from 3,600 to 5,400 feet.  The soils formed in material weathered from granite with a mantle of volcanic ash.  The soils are in a cool, subhumid climate with relatively dry summers.  The average annual precipitation varies from 35 to 50 inches.  Average January temperature is 22 degrees F; average July temperature is 62 degrees F; average annual temperature varies from 40 degrees to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 50 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ardtoo, Brickel, Jeru, Priestlake, Treble, and Vay soils.  Ardtoo and Treble soils are frigid.  Jeru and Priestlake soils contain less volcanic ash and formed in glacial till.  Brickel and Prouty soils have weathered bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  Vay soils contain more volcanic ash.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well-drained.  Runoff is rapid to very rapid.  Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the solum and rapid or very rapid in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The soils are used for timber-production, wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed.  A few areas are used for limited livestock grazing.  Natural vegetation is mainly western hemlock, western redcedar, western larch, and western white pine with understory of big blueberry, common beargrass, myrtle pachystima and northern twinflower.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Idaho and possibly eastern Washington and western Montana.  The series is moderately extensive.
