HAYDRAW SERIES

The Haydraw series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous silty alluvial deposits.  These soils are on alluvial fans and terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 9 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Haydraw silt loam, grassland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

	A--0 to 6 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (5 to 8 inches thick)

	Bk1--6 to 18 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate coarse subangular blocks; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; few fine masses of carbonates; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

	Bk2--18 to 28 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) silt loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate coarse subangular blocks; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; few fine masses of carbonates; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

	Bk3--28 to 41 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) silt loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate coarse subangular blocks; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; few fine masses of carbonates; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. (Combined Bk horizons 24 to 38 inches thick)

	BCk--41 to 58 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) silt loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; few fine masses of carbonates; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 18 inches thick)

	C--58 to 80 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) silt loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil temperature - 44 to 46 degrees F.

Moisture control section - between 4 and 12 inches.

Some pedons have an ABk horizon.

Some pedons have a calcareous Bw horizon up to 10 inches thick.

The calcic horizon is within a depth of 16 inches.

A horizon - Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y

Value:  4 or 5; 3 moist

Chroma:  2 or 3

Texture:  silt loam

Clay content: 18 to 27 percent

Reaction:  pH 7.4 to 8.4

Bk horizons - Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y

Value:  5,6 or 7; 4 or 5 moist

Chroma:  2, 3 or 4

Texture, less than 2 mm:  silt loam or silty clay loam

Clay content:  18 to 35 percent

Rock fragments:  0 to 5 percent pebbles

Calcium carbonate equivalent: 15 to 40 percent

Reaction:  pH 7.9 to 8.4

C horizon - Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y

Value:  6 or 7; 4 or 5 moist

Chroma:  2, 3 or 4

Texture: less than 2 mm:  silt loam, silty clay loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Silty clay is allowed below a depth of 60 inches.

Clay content: 18 to 35 percent (above a depth of 60 inches)

Rock fragments:  0 to 5 percent pebbles

Calcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 15 percent

Reaction: pH 7.9 to 8.4

COMPETING SERIES: Burgraff - has a paralithic contact above a depth of 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - alluvial fans and terraces.

Elevation -2,000 to 3,400 feet.

Parent material - calcareous silty alluvial deposits.

Slope - 0 to 9 percent.

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs, warm summers.

Mean annual precipitation - 14 to 16 inches.

Mean annual air temperature - 39 to 45 degrees F.

Frost-free period - 120 to 130 days (based on 32 degrees F and 50 percent probability).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Burgraff soils and the Boxwell, Cabbart and Floweree soils.  Burgraff, Boxwell and Cabbart soils occur on nearby uplands and Floweree soils occur on similar positions as Haydraw soils.  Boxwell soils are moderately deep and Cabbart soils are shallow to soft bedrock. Floweree soils have a cambic horizon and do not have a calcic horizon.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderately slow permeability; runoff is negligible to medium depending on slope.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Haydraw soils are used mainly for growing small grains and for range.  Potential native vegetation is mainly western wheatgrass, blue grama, bluegrass, needleandthread and fringed sagewort.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Haydraw soils are of small extent in western North Dakota, and possibly northwestern South Dakota and eastern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  McKenzie County, North Dakota, 2003.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 7 inches after mixing (A and Bk1 horizons); calcic horizon - the zone from 6 to 41 inches (Bk1, Bk2 and Bk3 horizons); particle-size control section - 10 to 40 inches (Bk1, Bk2 and Bk3 horizons).  Haydraw soils have a frigid temperature regime and an Aridic-Ustic moisture regime.
