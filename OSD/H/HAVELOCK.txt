HAVELOCK SERIES

The Havelock series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in loamy alluvium.  These soils are on floodplains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 740 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Cumulic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Havelock clay loam, on level flood plain, in a cultivated field.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 A1--23 to 33 centimeters; black (N 2/0) clay loam, very dark gray (N 3/0) dry; weak fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine fragments of snail shells; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.

 A2--33 to 61 centimeters; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine fragments of snail shells; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.

 A3--61 to 102 centimeters; very dark gray (5Y 3/1) clay loam, gray (5Y 5/1) dry; weak fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine fragments of snail shells; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the A horizon is 90 to 120 centimeters.)

 Cg1--102 to 135 centimeters; gray (5Y 5/1) loam; massive; friable; few fine fragments of snail shells; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (20 to 50 centimeters thick)

 Cg2--135 to 152 centimeters; gray (5Y 5/1) and gray (5Y 6/1) sandy loam; massive; friable; many small and medium white (5Y 8/1) calcium carbonate accumulations; common fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; about 5 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bishop, Millington, Riverston, Stearns, and Winner series.
Bishop--formed in moderately fine textured alluvium of granitic origin and are in areas that have a mean annual precipitation range of 130 to 380 millimeters
Millington--have a mollic epipedon 60 to 90 centimeters thick
Riverston--have a clay content of 5 to 12 percent in the lower third of the series control section
Stearns--have a clay content that averages 18 to 27 percent in the particle-size control section
Winner--have a rock fragment content of 35 to 60 percent in the lower third of the series control section

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--loamy alluvium
Landform--floodplains
Slope--0 to 2 percent
Elevation--300 to 400 meters above sea level
Mean annual air temperature--6 to 10 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation--585 to 890 millimeters
Frost-free period--155 to 200 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Clarion, Coland, and Wadena soils. 
Clarion--are at higher landscape positions on side slopes and do not have a frequently saturated zone within a depth of 1.2 meters during the wettest periods when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Coland--are on landscape positions similar to those of the Havelock soils and do not have carbonates within a depth of 122 centimeters
Wadena--are at higher landscape positions on terraces and have a sand content that averages more than 85 percent at depths between 60 and 100 centimeters

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--poorly drained--a frequently saturated zone occurs at the surface to 0.3 meters below the surface during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--1.00 to 10.00 micrometers per second in the upper two thirds of the series control section and 10.00 to 100.00 micrometers per second in the lower third of the series control section
Flooding--frequently or occasionally flooded for brief duration

USE AND VEGETATION:
Where drained, most areas are cultivated. The principal crops are corn and soybeans.  Most undrained areas are channeled and are in pasture with trees.  The native vegetation is grasses and sedges tolerant to excessive wetness.

Physiographic Division--Interior Plains
Physiographic Province--Central Lowland
Physiographic section--Western lake section
MLRA--Central Iowa and Minnesota Till Prairies (103)
LRR M; north-central Iowa and south-central Minnesota
