SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Distribution: Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. Extent: Extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Statesville Area, North Carolina; 1901

REMARKS: The 1979 revision used the linear relationship between the thickness of the clayey Bt horizon and depth to the bottom of the clayey Bt horizon as series criteria instead of solum thickness. 
The September 2025 revision reformatted the description to semi-tabular.  No data was changed.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to 23 centimeters (9 inches) (A and E horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 23 to 123 centimeters (9 to 48 inches) (BE, Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)
