HANDY SERIES

The Handy series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from igneous rocks with some influence from limestone and dolostone.  Handy soils are on fan remnants and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Clayey over loamy, smectitic over mixed, superactive, frigid Xeric Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Handy gravelly loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

COMPETING SERIES:  At present, there are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Handy soils are on fan remnants and hills.  These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from igneous rocks but are influenced some by limestone and dolostone.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,680 to 2,170 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 360 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Devoy, Locane, and Overland soils.  Devoy soils are clayey-skeletal, moderately deep to lithic contacts, have mollic epipedons, and a cryic temperature regime.  Locane soils are clayey-skeletal and shallow to lithic contacts.  Overland soils are loamy-skeletal, moderately deep to lithic contacts, and have calcic horizons and carbonatic mineralogy.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; very high surface runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Handy soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly big sagebrush, Nevada ephedra, Sandberg's bluegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail.  Some areas have scattered singleleaf pinyon and Utah juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 28B.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Eureka County (Diamond Valley Area), Nevada, 1971.

REMARKS:  The revision of January 2002 updates the taxonomic class from Fine, smectitic, frigid Xeric Haplargids.  There is a strongly contrasting particle-size class due to the major lithologic discontinuity at 76 cm.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 20 cm (A and BA horizons).
Argillic horizon - The zone from 20 to 76 cm (Bt1, Bt2, and Btk horizons).
Identifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 33 to 152 cm (Btk and 2Bk horizons).
Major lithologic discontinuity - The abrupt change to loamy material at 76 cm (2Bk horizon).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 20 to 100 cm (Bt1, Bt2, and Btk horizons and part of the 2Bk horizon).
