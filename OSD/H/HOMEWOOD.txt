HOMEWOOD SERIES

The Homewood series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are moderately deep or shallow to a fragipan. These soils formed in a thin mantle of loess as much as 56 cm (22 inches) thick and in the underlying weathered Illinoian till. Some pedons extend into residual parent materials. They are on till plains. Slope ranges from 2 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Clarksburg series. Clarksburg soils formed in colluvium, till, or residuum from limestone, shale, and sandstone with rock fragments dominantly of sandstone, chert, and limestone lithology.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Homewood soils are on till plains and till-covered sandstone hills. Slope ranges from 2 to 40 percent. The soils formed in Illinoian age till and in a thin mantle of loess in some areas. Some pedons extend into residual parent materials. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1016 mm (35 to 40 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 11 degrees C (49 to 52 degrees F). Elevation is 320 to 351 meters (1050 to 1150 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brownsville, Chili, Conotton, Dekalb, Gresham, Loudonville, Mechanicsburg, Negley, Parke, Titusville and Westmoreland soils. Chili, Conotton, Negley, and Parke soils are on nearby terraces. Brownsville and Dekalb soils are on siltstone and sandstone hills that do not have a mantle of till. Loudonville and Mechanicsburg soils are on till covered sandstone hills where bedrock is at depths of less than 102 cm (40 inches), or more than 102 cm (40 inches), respectively. The somewhat poorly drained Gresham soils and moderately well drained Titusville soils are in a toposequence with Homewood soils. They are on the lower parts of some slopes or in concave landscape positions. Westmoreland soils are in similar landscape positions but are formed in residuum.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. In undisturbed areas, the depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 46 to 91 cm (1.5 to 3.0 feet) between November and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is medium or high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high above the fragipan and moderately low in the fragipan. Permeability is moderate above the fragipan and slow in the fragipan. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used for cropland and pasture. Principal crops are corn, hay and small grain. Steeper slopes are in woodland. Native vegetation is mixed oak or beech and maple deciduous hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central and northeastern Ohio; MLRAs 114A and 139. The type location is in MLRA 114A. The series is of moderate extent, about 66,000 acres.
