HAYNIE SERIES

The Haynie series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on flood plains. These soils formed in calcareous alluvium. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 710 millimeters (28 inches).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Mollic Udifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Haynie silt loam, on a nearly level slope in a cultivated field, at an elevation of 325 meters (1,065 feet) above sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) dry; small clods parting to weak fine subangular blocky and weak fine granular structure; some stratification of lighter colors in the lower part; very friable; few dark brown (10YR 3/3) organic stains on faces of peds; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. [15 to 23 centimeters (6 to 9 inches) thick]

 C--18 to 152 centimeters (7 to 60 inches); alternating layers of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) and grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) dry; massive with weak thin alluvial stratification; common 3 to 5 millimeter (1/8 to 1/4 inch) lenses of very fine sandy loam; a lens of very fine sandy loam at 25 to 33 centimeters (10 to 13 inches); very friable; common fine distinct gray (5Y 5/1) redoximorphic depletions; few fine distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) and few fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; not all strata have redoximorphic features; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Land Resource Unit (LRU) 107B (Iowa and Missouri Deep Loess Hills); Monona County, Iowa; about 1 1/2 miles west and 1 mile north of Whiting; about 790 feet west and 1,420 feet north of the center of sec. 34, T. 85 N., R. 46 W.; USGS Sloan topographic quadrangle; lat. 42 degrees 8 minutes 20 seconds N. and long. 96 degrees 11 minutes 15 seconds W., NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth to carbonates--0 to 25 centimeters (0 to 10 inches)
Depth to redoximorphic concentrations--15 to 25 centimeters (6 to 10 inches)
Thickness of the ochric epipedon--less than 25 centimeters (10 inches)
Content of clay in the particle-size control section (weighted average)--15 to 18 percent
Content of sand in the particle-size control section (weighted average)--18 to 80 percent, mostly very fine sand, less than 15 percent fine sand and sand coarser than fine sand

Ap horizon:
Hue--10YR or 2.5Y
Value--3
Chroma--2
Texture--silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or silty clay loam
Clay content--15 to 30 percent
Sand content--18 to 55 percent
Calcium carbonate equivalent--0 to 25 percent
Reaction--neutral or slightly alkaline

C horizon:
Hue--10YR or 2.5Y
Value--4 or 5
Chroma--2 to 4
Texture: silt loam or very fine sandy loam, but some pedons contain strata, less than 5 inches thick, of fine sandy loam and loamy fine sand
Clay content--15 to 18 percent
Sand content--18 to 80 percent, mostly very fine sand
Calcium carbonate equivalent--3 to 30 percent
Reaction--slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline

The redoximorphic features in this profile are believed to be relict features

Some pedons have silty clay loam and silty clay strata below a depth of 127 centimeters (50 inches)

Some pedons have sandy materials below a depth of 152 centimeters (60 inches)

Some pedons have thin silty clay layers below a depth of 102 centimeters (40 inches)

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ion and McPaul series.
Ion--have a buried soil in the lower part of the series control section
McPaul--have less than 18 percent sand throughout the series control section

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--calcareous alluvium
Landform--flood plains
Slopes--0 to 5 percent
Elevation--213 to 503 meters (700 to 1,650 feet) above sea level
Mean annual air temperature--8 to 13 degrees C (47 to 56 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation--510 to 910 millimeters (20 to 36 inches)
Frost-free period--135 to 190 days
Note: The alluvium is 0.9 meters or more (3 feet or more) thick and typically grades to sandy alluvium as depth increases.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Albaton, Grable, Modale, Onawa,  and Sarpy soils.
Albaton--are in the lower elevations and have a clay content of more than 50 percent in the particle-size control section
Grable--are in landscape positions similar to those of the Haynie soils and have 65 to 95 percent fine sand within a depth of 46 to 76 centimeters (18 to 30 inches)
Modale--are in landscape positions similar to those of the Haynie soils and have a clay content of 40 to 60 percent within a depth of 46 to 76 centimeters (18 to 30 inches)
Onawa--are in the lower elevations and have a clay content of 50 to 60 percent in the upper third of the particle-size control section
Sarpy--are at the higher elevations and have a clay content of 2 to 5 percent in the particle-size control section

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage: a saturated zone occurs within depths of 122 to 183 centimeters (4 to 6 feet) during April to June in normal years and is considered apparent
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--1.00 to 10.00 micrometers per second
Surface runoff potential--low
Flooding--none to frequent for brief to long periods during the months of February to November in most years resulting from precipitation events and snowmelt

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are cultivated. The principal crops are corn, soybeans, small grain, and hay. Some areas are land-leveled and irrigated. The native vegetation is big bluestem, indiangrass, switchgrass, and other grasses of the tall grass prairie.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
LRR G; LRU 63B (Southern Rolling Pierre Shale Plains) 
LRR H; MLRAs 74 (Central Kansas Sandstone Hills) and 76 (Bluestem Hills)  
LRR M; LRU 102C (Loess Uplands), MLRA 106 (Nebraska and Kansas Loess-Drift Hills), LRU 107B (Iowa and Missouri Deep Loess Hills), and LRU 115B (Central Mississippi Valley Wooded Slopes, Western Part)

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters (10 to 40 inches - C horizon).
Series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (59 inches - Ap and C horizons).
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 18 centimeters (7 inches - Ap horizon);
Udic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange class is inferred from lab data for similar soils in the surrounding area.

Taxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.

The redoximorphic features in this profile are believed to be related to the moisture status of the materials at the time of deposition and not related to present day moisture status. The redoximorphic features in this profile were not considered in the current classification of the soil.
