HANLON SERIES

The Hanlon series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium. These soils are on flood plains. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 79 centimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Cumulic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Hanlon fine sandy loam, on a nearly level flood plain, adjacent to the Cedar River, in a meadow.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 A1--0 to 18 centimeters; black (10YR 2/1) fine sandy loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; weak very fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; very friable; neutral; clear smooth boundary.

 A2--18 to 69 centimeters; black (10YR 2/1) fine sandy loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; neutral; clear smooth boundary.

 A3--69 to 102 centimeters; black (10YR 2/1) fine sandy loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; neutral; clear smooth boundary.

 A4--102 to 127 centimeters; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) fine sandy loam grading to medium sandy loam with depth, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; very friable; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.  [Combined thickness of the A horizon is 91 to 122 centimeters.]

 Bt--127 to 175 centimeters; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) sandy loam; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; some clay bridging between sand grains; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) coats on faces of peds; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary.  [Combined thickness of the B horizon is 0 to 58 centimeters.]

 BC--175 to 200 centimeters; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam; weak coarse prismatic structure; friable; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) 104-Eastern Iowa and Minnesota Till Prairies; Mitchell County, Iowa subset; about 1 mile west of St. Ansgar; about 100 feet north and 2,315 feet west of the southeast corner of section 23, T. 99 N., R. 18 W.; USGS Osage SW quadrangle; lat. 43.371667 degrees and long. -92.933889 degrees; WGS84.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Mitchell County, Iowa, 1971

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 175 centimeters (A1, A2, A3, A4, and Bt horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from 127 to 175 centimeters (Bt horizon);
udic moisture regime.

The Bt horizon does not have the 1.2 percent clay increase to meet the requirements of an argillic horizon.

The cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
