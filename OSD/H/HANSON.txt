HANSON SERIES

The Hanson series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium and glacial till derived from limestone rock.  These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans, mountain slopes, hills and moraines.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic Calcic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Hanson loam, native grass (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A1--0 to 8 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; 5 percent gravel; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.

    A2--8 to 14 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak fine and medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic, many very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 10 percent limestone gravel; disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of A horizons - 6 to 18 inches)

    Bk1--14 to 26 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very cobbly loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel, 50 percent cobbles; disseminated calcium carbonate, many masses of calcium carbonate, and continuous distinct calcium carbonate crusts on undersides of fragments; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline; diffuse smooth boundary. (5 to 20 inches thick)

    Bk2--26 to 42 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 8/4) extremely cobbly loam, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 25 percent gravel, 55 percent cobbles; disseminated calcium carbonate, many masses of calcium carbonate, and continuous distinct calcium carbonate crusts on undersides of fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. (9 to 28 inches thick)

    Bk3--42 to 60 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 7/4) extremely cobbly loam, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel, 55 percent cobbles; disseminated calcium carbonate and continuous distinct calcium carbonate coatings on fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline.
