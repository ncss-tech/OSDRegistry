HERM SERIES

The Herm series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived principally from interbedded sandstone and shale and in some pedons have eolian influence in the upper layers.  Herm soils are on mountain slopes, hillslopes, and structural benches.  Slopes range from 0 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 508 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4.4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Herm loam, on a west facing, simple, 5 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 2,469 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) Described on October 1, 1986.
