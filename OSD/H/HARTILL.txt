HARTILL SERIES

The Hartill series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from argillite, siltite, phyllite, graywacke, or quartzite with a mantle of volcanic ash. These soils are on ridges, shoulders, and backslopes of mountains. Slopes of 0 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 575 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.
