SERIES ESTABLISHED: Person County, North Carolina, 1928.

REMARKS:
12/2012 Revision updates the format and added latitude and longitude.
8/1991 Revision changed depth to bedrock from "more than 48 inches to more than 60 inches" to be consistent with one depth to bedrock class as shown on the Soil Interpretation Records for Helena.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to 12 inches (Ap and E horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 12 to 46 inches (BE, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 and BCg horizons)
Aquic conditions--periodic episaturation and reduction in a zone within the upper 24 inches of the argillic horizon
