HORTONVILLE SERIES 

The Hortonville series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed primarily in calcareous loamy till on drumlins and ground moraines.  Slope ranges from 1 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches).  Mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Guelph, and Waymor series.  Guelph soils have hues yellower than 5YR throughout the argillic horizon.   Waymor soils average 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle size control section.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hortonville soils are on drumlins and ground moraines. Slope ranges from 1 to 35 percent.  Hortonville soils formed mostly in calcareous loamy till of late Wisconsinan Age.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 710 to 840 mm (28 to 33 inches).  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8.3 to 10.0 degrees C (46 to 50 degrees F).  The frost free period ranges from about 135 to 155 days.  Elevation ranges from 213 to 305 meters (700 feet to 1000 feet).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are mainly the Symco and Kewaunee soils.  The somewhat poorly drained Symco soils form a drainage sequence with the Hortonville soils.  Kewaunee soils are nearby on landscape positions similar to those of Hortonville soils where there is more clay in the soil. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained.  The potential for surface runoff ranges from medium to very high. saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderately slow.  

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used for cropland.  Common crops are corn, small grain, and hay.  A few areas are used for pastureland or woodland.  Native vegetation is mixed hardwood forest.  Common trees are American basswood, sugar maple, northern red oak, and yellow birch. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central Wisconsin.  Hortonville soils are of large extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Outagamie County, Wisconsin, 1975. 

REMARKS:  The Hortonville soils were formerly included with the Kewaunee series.  

A new series is needed for 1,755 acres correlated  as Hortonville, limestone substratum in Outagamie County (limestone at 40 to 60 inches).

In Winnebago County, there are 28,568 acres correlated as a Taxadjunt to the Hortonville series because they do not have a glossic horizon.  It appears they classify as fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Typic Hapludalfs.  They do not fit any existing series.  A new series is needed.

10/04  The difference in concept between Hortonville and Waymor is unclear. It appears that, at the time of mapping, the concept was that Hortonville had more clay than Waymor in the lower subsoil and in the substratum. However, numerous field descriptions and limited lab data do not show a significant mutually exclusive difference. This revision differentiates the two soils based on the weighted average clay content in the particle-size control section (18-27% for Waymor and 27-35% for Hortonville). The limited lab data available supports this. However, field descriptions do not entirely support this separation. For example, the typical pedon for Waymor in Kewaunee County has textures of silty clay loam and clay loam in the argillic horizon. If the textures are correct, this pedon would average more than 27 percent clay in the argillic. Additional study of these two soils is needed to determine if they can be separated and on what criteria.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - 0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 inches) (Ap); glossic horizon - 23 to 31 cm (9 to 12 inches) (B/E); argillic horizon - 23 to 71 cm (9 to 28 inches) (B/E, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3); haplic feature - glossic horizon less than 51 cm (20 inches) thick. 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to soil survey sample number S78WI-135-003 for NSSL data on the typical pedon.
