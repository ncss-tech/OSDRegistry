REMARKS: This subaqueous series is mapped in areas previously published as water in Connecticut soil survey publications.

Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include--
Peraquic feature--Positive soil water potential (permanently submerged) at the soil surface. (under 2 meters of salt water).
Haplic feature--Have an n-value of 0.7 or less (or a nonfluid class) or less than 8 percent clay in some horizon at a depth between 20 and 50 centimeters.
Particle-size control section--The zone from 0 to 100 centimeters (0 to 40 inches).
Hypersulfidic materials--The zone from 0 to 200 centimeters (Aseg and Cseg horizons) have oxidized reactions with pH values less than 4 after 16 weeks.
