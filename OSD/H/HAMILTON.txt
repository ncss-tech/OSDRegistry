HAMILTON SERIES

The Hamilton series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources. These soils are on stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Hamilton loam, in hayland on a 1 percent slope, at 1,060 meters elevation (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise indicated).

	Ap--0 to 16 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  

	A--16 to 26 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky parting to moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of A horizons 18 to 38 cm)

	Bw--26 to 47 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 2 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual smooth boundary. (15 to 21 cm thick)

	Bk1--47 to 82 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 2 percent gravel; few fine faint calcium carbonate masses in the matrix; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); gradual smooth boundary.  

	Bk2--82 to 137 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 2 percent gravel; common fine distinct calcium carbonate masses in the matrix; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of Bk horizons 59 to 117 cm)

	2C--137 to 152 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) gravelly loamy fine sand, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 20 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4).

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Ravalli County (Bitterroot Valley Area), Montana, 1952.

REMARKS: Diagnostic features and horizons recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section - from 25 to 100 cm (part of the A, Bw, Bk1, and part of the Bk2 horizons)
Mollic epipedon - from the soil surface to 26 cm (Ap and A horizons)
Cambic horizon - from 26 to 47 cm (Bw horizon)
Horizon of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation - from 47 to 137 cm (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)

Hamilton soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
