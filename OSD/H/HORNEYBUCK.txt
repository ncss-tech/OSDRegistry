HORNEYBUCK SERIES 

The Horneybuck series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on headslopes, sinkholes, and saddles on ridges.  They formed in colluvium and valley fill.  Slopes range from 3 to 8 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Aquic Paleudults 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Horneybuck silt loam on a 4 percent slope in a pasture at an elevation of 1,310 feet. (Colors are for moist soils unless otherwise stated.)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Horneybuck soils are on headslopes, sinkholes, and saddles on ridges.  Slopes range from 3 to 8 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium and the underlying valley fill.  Elevations are commonly 1250 to 1450 feet.  The mean annual temperature varies from 55 to 58 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation varies from 38 to 48 inches. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These soils are Captina, Clarksville, Goss, Hailey, Noark, Rueter, Scholten and Tonti soils.  Captina, Clarksville, Noark, Scholten, and Tonti soils are on ridgetops. Captina, Scholten, and Tonti soils have fragipans.  Clarksville and Noark soils have a skeletal particle size class.  Goss, Hailey, and Rueter soils are on sideslopes and have a skeletal particle size class. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained.  Runoff is medium. Permeability is moderately slow. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for pasture and hayland.  A few areas are used for cultivated crops.  Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Ozarks region (MLRA's 116A and 116B) of southern Missouri and possibly north Arkansas.  This series is of small extent.
