MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Caldwell County, North Carolina; 1983.

REMARKS: This soil was formerly included in the Talladega and Tallapoosa series.  The completed soil temperature study indicates the county where the series type site is located is mesic throughout. The 08/2000 revision updates the series to a mesic temperature regime.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--The zone from 0 to 12 inches (the A1, A2, and BA horizons)
Argillic horizon--The zone from 12 to 24 inches (the Bt horizon)
Paralithic contact--The contact with weathered bedrock at 24 inches

ADDITIONAL DATA: Engineering Index Data from Soil Mechanics Lab, Ft. Worth, TX; pedon (S80NC-027-005). Sand mineralogy (fine sand) of the Bt horizon from North Carolina State University, Department of Soil Science Lab., May 12, 1980:

Fine Sand Mineralogy (Optical Grain Count); quartz 64.3 percent; mica 23.0 percent; opaque 1.7 percent; and heavy minerals 11.0 percent.

Data Map Unit ID: To be developed
