SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Distribution: North Carolina and possibly Virginia 
Extent: Small. Known areas of this series are on stream terraces adjacent to streams that dissect Triassic Basins in North Carolina.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Stokes County, North Carolina; 1992.

REMARKS: Hornsboro soils were formerly included with the Wahee series. Wahee soils do not have more than 35 percent base saturation at 50 inches below the upper boundary of the Bt horizon and also lack the presence of soluble salts.  The December 2025 revision clarified the directions to the type location.  Type location was not moved.  The format was also updated.  No data was changed.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 25 centimeters (0 to 10 inches) (Ap and E horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 25 to 157 centimeters (10 to 62 inches) below the surface (Btg, Bt1, Bt2, and B'tg horizons)
Natric horizon--the zone from 25 to 157 centimeters (10 to 62 inches) below the surface (Btg, Bt1, Bt2, and B'tg horizons)
