HUNNTON SERIES

The Hunnton series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Hunnton soils are on fan remnants, ballenas, and plateaus.  Slopes are 1 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Dewrust and Goosel series.

Dewrust soils are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative following summer convection storms and have mean annual soil temperature of 13 to 14 degrees C.  Goosel soils have lithic contacts below the duripan at depths of 53 to 100 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hunnton soils are on fan remnants, ballenas, and plateaus.  They typically occur on summit, shoulder, and footslope positions.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 1 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,310 to 2,080 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm in Nevada and up to 300 mm in parts of northeastern California and southwestern Idaho.  The mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C and the frost-free period is 90 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:   These are the Crooked Creek, Ocala, and Wieland soils.  Crooked Creek soils have a mollic epipedon and an aquic moisture regime.  Ocala soils do not have argillic horizons and are saline-sodic.  Wieland soils do not have indurated duripans.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; very high surface runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Hunnton soils are used for livestock grazing, urban development, and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, Douglas rabbitbrush, phlox, Sandberg bluegrass, basin wildrye, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Nevada, northeastern California, and southwestern Idaho.  These soils are extensive with about 268,000 acres of the series mapped to date.  The series concept and main acreage is in MLRA 25, while minor acreage occurs in MLRAs 23, 24, and 28B.
