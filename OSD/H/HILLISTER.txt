HILLISTER SERIES

The Hillister series consists of loamy, well drained, moderately permeable soils that are deep to weathered stratified sandstone and shale. These soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep interfluves of the Willis and Whitsett Formation. Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1397 mm (55 inch) and the mean annual temperature is about 19 degrees C (66 degrees F).
