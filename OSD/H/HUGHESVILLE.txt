HUGHESVILLE SERIES

The Hughesville series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum or colluvium mainly from limestone.  These soils are on mountains and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, frigid Calcic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hughesville flaggy loam, woodland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).
