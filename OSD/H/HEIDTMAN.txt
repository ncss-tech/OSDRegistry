GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Heidtman soils are on flood plains and low stream terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from granitic rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,410 to 1,450 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to l10 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Mindlebaugh, Fettic, Job, and Voltaire soils.  Mindlebaugh soils have aquic conditions between 50 and 76 cm and mollic epipedons less than 50 cm thick.  Fettic soils have natric horizons and mollic epipedons less than 50 cm thick.  Job soils are coarse-loamy and have ochric epipedons.  Voltaire soils have aquic conditions high in the profile and have mollic epipedons less than 50 cm thick.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained; medium surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 90 and 150 cm (moderately deep and deep free water occurrence classes) from December through May.  Cumulative annual duration classes are Common or Persistent.  The water table drops to 150 or 180 cm in the fall.  These soils are susceptible to occasional flooding for brief periods between December and May.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Heidtman soils are used for irrigated cropland, pasture, and hayland.  The principal crops are alfalfa hay and small grains.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 26.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Douglas County (Carson Valley Area), Nevada l975.

REMARKS:  The revision of 4/2000 moves the type location to a more representative area.  It also changes the series concept by increasing the thickness of the mollic epipedon and updating the taxonomic subgroup from Fluvaquentic to Cumulic.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 135 cm (Ap, A1, ABk, A2, A3, A4, and Ag horizons).
Identifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 41 to 56 cm (ABk horizon).
Aquic conditions - The conditions and endosaturation, reduction, and redoximorphic features from 119 to 152 cm at some time in normal years (Ag and Ccg horizons).
Particle size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (ABk, A2, and A3 horizons and part of the A1 horizon).
