HUCBERIT SERIES

The Hucberit series consists of very deep well drained soils formed in colluvium and/or residuum from gneiss and schist with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  They are on mountain slopes and ridges.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high and slopes range from 5 to 70 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 54 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Whitehorse series. Whitehorse soils have 20 to 35 percent clay in the 2Bw and 2C horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hucberit soils are on mountain slopes and ridges at elevations of 4,300 to 5,820 feet with slopes of 5 to 70 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from gneiss and schist with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  The average annual temperature is 38 to 41 degrees F. and the average precipitation is 40 to 60 inches. The frost free season is 30 to 100 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Berthahill, Jury, Rettig and Vaywood series.  Berthahill and Vaywood soils are on mountain side slopes and ridges and are loamy skeletal. Jury soils are on mountain side slopes and have a frigid soil temperature regime. Rettig soils are on mountain side slopes, have micaceous mineralogy and have a frigid soil temperature regime.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, wildlife habitat, recreation and watershed. Potential natural vegetation is mountain hemlock, subalpine fir, Engleman spruce, lodgepole pine and Douglas fir with an understory of queencup beadlily, fools huckleberry menziesia, dampwoods blueberry, common beargrass, broadleaf arnica, Rocky Mountain maple, myrtle pachystima, western meadowrue, common prince's pine and starry false Solomons seal.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North central Idaho. Hucberit soils are not extensive, about 2,700 acres in size.
