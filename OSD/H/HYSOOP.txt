HYSOOP SERIES

The Hysoop series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from red calcareous conglomerate or other red sedimentary rock.   These soils occur on eroded fan remnants or hills. Slopes range from 4 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcidic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Hysoop sandy loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

 A--0 to 15 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/2) sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots throughout; many very fine irregular pores; 5 percent gravel, slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 18 cm thick)

 Bt--15 to 30 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/3) sandy clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist;  moderate medium prismatic structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots throughout; many very fine irregular pores; 5 percent gravel; 65 percent prominent clay films on faces of peds; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.

 C2--98 to 152 cm; light red (2.5YR 6/6) paragravelly silty clay loam, reddish brown (2.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; very hard, firm, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; 25 percent paragravel; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).
