HACKROY SERIES

The Hackroy series consists of very shallow or shallow, well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in material weathered from tuff or basalt on summits, beveled summits, and shoulders of mesas and undulating plateaus.  Slopes are 1 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Aridic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Hackroy sandy loam--woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; common fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt1--3 to 9 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine prismatic structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 3 percent paragravel; continuous clay films on faces of peds; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)

    2Bt2--9 to 14 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) paragravelly clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 25 percent paragravel and 5 percent paracobbles; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 9 inches thick)

    2Cr--14 to 24 inches; moderately cemented rhyolitic tuff.

TYPE LOCATION: Los Alamos County, New Mexico; about 5 miles southwest of Whiterock; east on Ancho Canyon trail; N.  1,742,900 feet and E. 502,000 feet, Latitude 35 degrees 47 minutes 27 seconds N, 106 degrees 14 minutes 37 seconds W, NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture - The soil moisture control section is moist in all parts during the 60 days following the winter solstice. It is moist in some part less than 40 percent and moist in all parts less than 25 percent of the time when the soil temperature at 20 inches is above 41 degrees F. The soils are driest in May and June. The soil moisture regime is ustic bordering on aridic.

Mean annual soil Temperature: 49 to 54 degrees F.
Depth to paralithic contact: 8 to 20 inches

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hackroy soils are on summits, beveled summits, and shoulders of mesas and undulating plateaus.  Slopes are 1 to 12 percent.  The soil formed in material weathered from tuff or basalt. The elevation is about 6,000 to 8,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 to 16 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 47 to 52 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 110 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Nyjack and Frijoles soils.  Both are deeper than 20 inches to bedrock and contain less than 35 percent clay in the control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mostly for grazing by wildlife.  Native vegetation is twoneedle pinyon, oneseed juniper, and blue grama.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northcentral New Mexico. MLRA 36. The series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Cibola County, New Mexico, 1985.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: The zone from the surface to a depth of about 3 inches.  (A horizon)
Argillic horizon: The zone from about 3 to 14 inches.  (Bt horizon)
Paralithic contact: The boundary at about 14 inches.  (2Cr layer)

In February 2002 the lithic contact was changed to a paralithic contact and the taxonomic class was changed from Lithic Haplustalfs to shallow Aridic Haplustalfs. These changes were recommended following fieldwork on the Bandelier National Monument.

Classified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Sampled for mineralogy and sent to the SCS Laboratory at Riverside during 1974.  Sample Number R74-292.
