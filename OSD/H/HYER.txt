HYER SERIES

The Hyer series consists of very deep, well-drained soils that formed in eolian deposits derived from sandstone and shale over alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Hyer soils are on fan piedmonts. Slopes are 1 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Blanding, Depolvo, Nepesta, Tensleep, Wilid, and Wyotite series. Blanding soils have hue of 5YR or redder and receive appreciably more precipitation in the winter months. Depolvo soils have significant amounts of volcanic ash and mica in their profiles.  Nepesta soils have thick Ap horizons and have epipedons that border mollic or anthropic.  Tensleep soils have an argillic horizon less than 25 inches thick.  Wilid and Wyotite soils have hue of 10YR or yellower and are more moist in May and June. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hyer soils are on fan piedmonts. They formed in eolian deposits derived from sandstone and shale over alluvium derived from mixed sources. Slopes are 1 to 2 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,200 to 6,900 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 11 to 14 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Harvey, Lazarus, Palma, and Witt soils.  Harvey soils are coarse loamy, do not have an argillic horizon, and occur on south facing backslopes of undulating plains. Lazarus soils have a thick mollic epipedon and are located on the floodplains of valley floors. Palma soils are coarse-loamy and are located on north facing backslopes of undulating plains. Witt soils have a calcic horizon and are on adjacent higher areas of summits of alluvial plains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low surface runoff; permeability is moderately slow. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Hyer soils are used for urban development and livestock grazing. Present vegetation is blue grama, snakeweed, poverty threeawn, cheat grass, black grama, and walkingstick cholla.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Hyer soils are of small extent in the north-western part of the Estancia Basin in the Mexican Highland section of the Basin and Range physiographic province in northcentral New Mexico, MLRA 70C.
