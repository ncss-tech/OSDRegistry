HOODOO SERIES

The Hoodoo Series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in alluvium mainly from volcanic ash. Hoodoo soils are in drainageways, on stream terraces, bottomlands and around perimeters of lakes. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hoodoo soils are in drainageways, on stream terraces, bottomlands, and around perimeters of lakes. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 1,900 to 2,800 feet. The soils formed in alluvium mainly from volcanic ash. The mean annual precipitation is 25 to 38 inches. The average January temperature is about 24 degrees F. and the average July temperature is about 64 degrees F. The mean annual air temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is 80 to 110 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bonner, Pend Oreille, Pywell, Rathdrum, Treble, and the competing Odenson soils. Bonner, Pend Oreille, Rathdrum, and Treble soils are well drained. Bonner and Rathdrum soils are on on glacial outwash plains and terraces.  Pend Oreille and Treble soils are on mountains and foothills.  Odenson soils are fine-silty in the control section and are on glaciolacustrine terraces.  Pywell soils are very poorly drained organic soils and are in depressional areas of drainageways and floodplains. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained. Runoff is very slow. Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderate or moderately slow in the substratum. The soils are occasionally to frequently flooded during the spring months. 

USE AND VEGETATION: The soils are used mainly for hay and pasture. Some drained areas are used for small grains. Natural vegetation is grasses, sedges, and forbs with scattered black cottonwood and quaking aspen. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Idaho and northeastern Washington. The series is moderately extensive. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Bonner County, Idaho, 1981. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon - 0 to 10 inches (A1 and A2 horizons) 
Cambic horizon - 10 to 20 inches (Bg1 and Bg2 horizons) 
Particle-size control section - 0 to 40 inches (A1, A2, Bg1, Bg2, Cg1, and part of the Cg2 horizons) 

Further investigation is needed at the official Type Location to determine if andic soil property criteria is met.  Lab data from the Hoodoo modal site in Spokane County, Washington meets Aquandic subgroup criteria and will be considered a taxadjunt to the series.  There is some question as to whether these wet soils high in ash meet andic soil properties.
