HEADWATERS SERIES

The Headwaters series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium over semiconsolidated sediments.  These soils are on dissected alluvial fans, stream terraces, hills and sedimentary plains.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Headwaters loam, cropland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 5 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick)

    A2--5 to 7 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; common very fine, fine, and few medium roots; slightly effervescent; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 7 inches thick)

    Bk--7 to 29 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots, few fine and medium roots; violently effervescent; common medium soft masses of segregated lime; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (16 to 26 inches thick.)

    Cr--29 to 60 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 7/4) semiconsolidated sedimentary beds that crush to a silty clay loam (interbedded with semiconsolidated sandy materials), light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) moist; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

Rothican (WY) - are very deep.
Rothiemay (MT) - are very deep.
Zinzer (CO) - are very deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - dissected alluvial fans, stream terraces, hills, and sedimentary plains.
Elevation - 4,200 to 4,700 feet.
Slope - 2 to 15 percent.
Parent material - alluvium deposited over semiconsolidated sediments.
Climate - long, cold winter; moist springs; warm summers. 
Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 14 inches.
Mean annual temperature - 41 to 45 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 95 to 115 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Headwaters soils are used mainly for nonirrigated small grain crops and hay.  Potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, needleandthread, western wheatgrass, forbs, and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Headwaters soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Gallatin County, Montana, 1997.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the surface to 7 inches (Ap and A2 horizons); a calcic horizon from 7 to 29 inches (Bk horizon); and a paralithic contact at a depth of 29 inches (Cr horizon).  Headwaters soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
