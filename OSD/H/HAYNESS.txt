HAYNESS SERIES

The Hayness series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in medium textured alluvium derived from red sandstone, siltstone, and shale.  These soils are on alluvial fans, valley sideslopes, and toeslopes, and have slopes of 1 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Entic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hayness loam - irrigated pasture.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap--0 to 9 inches; weak red (2.5YR 5/2) loam, dusky red (2.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 12 inches thick)

    AC--9 to 18 inches; weak red (2.5YR 5/2) loam, dusky red (2.5YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; soft, friable; nonsticky and nonplastic; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 11 inches thick)

    C1--18 to 29 inches; reddish brown (2.5YR 5/4) loam, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable; slightly sticky and slightly plastic; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 20 inches thick)

    C2--29 to 60 inches; reddish brown (2.5YR 5/4) silt loam, reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  La Plata County, Colorado, about 900 feet west and 1800 feet north of the southeast corner of Section 28, T. 36 N., R. 9 W.  U.S.G.S. Durango East quad.; Lat. 37 degrees, 21 minutes, 20 seconds N., and Long. 107 degrees, 31 minutes, 08 seconds W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 51 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 degrees to 67 degrees F.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches.  The soil is typically calcareous throughout, but may be noncalcareous up to 7 inches.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent throughout the soil and are mostly pebble and cobble sized sandstone fragments.

The A horizon has a hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is typically a loam or fine sandy loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.

The C horizon has hue of 10R through 5YR, value of 4 through 6, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6.  Texture of the particle-size control section is typically loam, silt loam, or clay loam, but clay content ranges from 18 to 35 percent; silt from 20 to 60; and sand from 20 to 50 with more than 15 percent being fine sand or coarser.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Armo (KS) and Java (SD) soils.  Armo soils have hue of 10YR.  Java soils have hues of 10YR or yellower.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hayness soils are on alluvial fans, valley sideslopes, and toeslopes.  The soils formed in calcareous medium textured material weathered from redbed sandstone, siltstone, and shale.   Elevation ranges from 6,500 to 7,600 feet.  Slopes are 1 to 20 percent.   Average annual precipitation is 18 to 22 inches, and is distributed fairly evenly throughout the year.  PE Index is about 50 at the type location.  Average annual temperature ranges from 45 degrees to 50 degrees F., and average summer temperature ranges from 58 degrees to 65 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Umbarg and Tefton soils.   Umbarg soils have yellower hues.  Tefton soils are somewhat poorly drained soils on floodplains of lower elevations.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate runoff; moderately slow to moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  This soil is used for irrigated crops, rangeland, and urban development.  Native vegetation is Arizona fescue, mountain muhly, needleandthread, western wheatgrass, Gambel oak, and a few pinyon pine and ponderosa pine on the more sloping areas.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The series occurs in southwestern and western Colorado.  The series is of minor extent.
