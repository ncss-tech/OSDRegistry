HARDISTER SERIES

The Hardister series consists of very deep, well-drained soils that have moderately rapid permeability.  They formed in ashy alluvium on valley floors and stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  The average annual temperature is about 7.8 degrees C., and the average annual precipitation is about 360 mm.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy, glassy, mesic Vitrandic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hardister ashy fine sandy loam - range.  On a 4 percent smooth slope, east aspect, 1,570 meter elevation.  (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise stated.  This profile was described on November 8, 1979.)

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Hardesty series.  These soils have stratifications containing silt loam and very fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand and fine sandy loams, have mottles below 50 cm, and have bulk densities between 0.80 and 0.85.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:   Hardister soils are on valley floors and stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Elevation ranges from 1,495 to 1,710 meters.  The soil formed in alluvium from volcanic ash.  The average annual precipitation is about 300 to 410  cm, the average annual air temperature is about 7.2 to 8.3 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 95 to 115 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bluehill, Coalbank, Cottonthomas, Stines, Tomsherry, and Wilsongulch series.  Bluehill soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact.  Coalbank, Cottonthomas and Tomsherry soils are frigid.  Stines and Wilsongulch soils are skeletal.  Tomsherry soils have a duripan at a depth of 50 to 100 cm.  Coalbank and Stines soils are on steep northerly slopes, Bluehill and Wilsongulch soils are on steep southerly slopes.  Tomsherry soils are on fan terraces.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Slow runoff.  Moderate or moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Hardister soils are used for range.  The natural vegetation is basin big sagebrush, Wyoming big sagebrush, Sandberg bluegrass, Nevada bluegrass, and needleandthread.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Hardister soils are found in southern Idaho.  They are not extensive. MLRA 25
