USE AND VEGETATION:  
Most areas are cultivated and much of it is irrigated.  The main crops are corn, alfalfa, soybeans, and sorghums.  The native vegetation are big bluestem, switchgrass, little bluestem, and western wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North central Kansas. (LRR H Great Plains Winter wheat and Range, MLRA 74 Central Kansas Sandstone Hills) The series is moderately extensive.  

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES PROPOSED: Republic County, Kansas, 2011.

REMARKS:  
The diagnostic horizons and characteristics recognized in this soil are:  
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 26 centimeters (0 to 10 inches) (Ap and A horizons) 
Irregular decrease of organic carbon: 52 centimeters (20 inches) Ab horizon

There has been discussion of whether these soils are well drained or moderately well drained, because redoximorphic concentrations can be found within 100 centimeters. These could be caused by irrigation or by the flooding occurring in the area.  The majority of these areas are irrigated and treated like well drained soils instead of moderately well drained soils.  It was decided to call them well drained because of that.

The series was set up to take the place of Cozad soils mapped on flood plains.
