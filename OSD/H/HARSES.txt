HARSES SERIES

The Harses series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gypseous eolian sands. These nearly level soils are on playa steps. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Lark series. Lark soils have electrical conductivities ranging from 3 to 8 dS/m.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Harses soils are on playa steps, generally leeward of playas. Slope is 0 to 5 percent. These soils formed from gypseous eolian deposits. Elevation ranges from 3,900 to 4,130 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. Precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September. The mean annual air temperature is 64 to 70 degrees F. The frost-free period is 180 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Lark, Astrobee, Gyplaya, and Transformer  soils. Lark soils have electrical conductivities ranging from 3 to 8 dS/m. Astrobee soils have pedogenic gypsum masses within 7 inches of the soil surface.  Gyplaya soils have salic horizons and a water table within 20 inches. Transformer soils have a water table within 30 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; negligible runoff; moderately rapid permeability. Water table is greater than 40 inches in most years.

USE AND VEGETATION: The major uses are military exercises and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is alkali sacaton, James' seaheath, New Mexico bluestem, Trans-Pecos false clapdaisy and Trans-Pecos sea lavender. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South central New Mexico, limited to the Tularosa Basin. MLRA 42, Harses is of limited extent.
