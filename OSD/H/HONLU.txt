HONLU SERIES

The Honlu series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.  Honlu soils are on fan remnants and hillslopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Honlu gravelly loam, on a southeast facing, linear, 8 percent slope in Utah juniper with an understory of black sagebrush and needleandthread at an elevation of 6,300 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    The surface is covered by 15 percent gravel.

    A--0 to 3 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) gravelly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and many very fine roots; many very fine and fine random tubular pores; 20 percent gravel; very slightly effervescent (6 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 8 inches thick).

    Bk1--3 to 9 inches; strong brown (7.5YR  5/6) gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common fine and many very fine random tubular pores; 15 percent gravel; slightly effervescent (11 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated and segregated as 1 mm thick coatings on underside of gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary.

(5 to 21 inches thick).

    Bk3--18 to 32 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few fine and very fine random tubular pores; 35 percent gravel; strongly effervescent (23 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated and segregated as common fine veins and 1 mm thick coatings on gravel; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 24 inches thick).

    Bk4--32 to 44 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/4) gravelly loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist; massive; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few fine and very fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel; strongly effervescent (30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated and segregated as common fine filaments and 1 mm thick coatings on gravel; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 22 inches thick).

    Bk5--44 to 60 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/4) gravelly loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist; massive; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few fine and very fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel; strongly effervescent (26 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated and segregated as common fine filaments and 1 mm thick coatings on gravel; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8).
