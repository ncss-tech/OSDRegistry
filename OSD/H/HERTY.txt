HERTY SERIES

The Herty series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in shale and mudstone residuum on interfluves of the Caddell, Manning and Upper Yegua Formations.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils occur on interfluves on coastal plains.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C (66 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1194 mm (47 in).

Kisatchie soils: do not have vertic properties
Nikful soils: do not have vertic properties
Oakhurst soils: do not have a lithologic discontinuity
Oula soils: do not have a lithologic discontinuity
Rayburn soils: do not have a lithologic discontinuity

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: residuum from shale and/or mudstone  
Geology: Caddell, Manning and Upper Yegua formations
Landscape: coastal plain
Landform: smooth to slightly concave interfluves
Slope: 0 to 3 percent
Mean annual air temperature range: 18 to 20 degrees C (65 to 68 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation range: 1100 to 1275 mm (43 to 50 in)
Frost-free period: 235 to 250 days
Elevation: 40 to 122 m (130 to 400 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Diboll, Keltys, Kellison, Kurth and Moswell series.  
Diboll soils: have less than 35 percent clay throughout and are on similar landscapes.
Keltys soils: have a coarse-loamy control section, are on slightly higher positions, are better drained.
Kellison soils: are better drained, are on steeper slopes.
Kurth soils: have a fine-loamy control section, are on slightly higher positions, are better drained.
Moswell soils: have a very-fine control section, are on slightly higher positions, are better drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Permeability is very slow.  Runoff is high on 0 to 1 percent slopes and very high on 1 to 3 percent slopes.  A perched water table saturates the surface and upper Bt horizon for periods of 30 or more cumulative days during the months of January to April.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for woodland and pastureland.  Native vegetation is mixed pine and hardwood forest with an understory of grasses and shrubs. The shrinking and swelling of the clayey subsoil generally causes many trees to have crooked trunks. A few areas have been cleared for pasture. Pastures are in common bermudagrass, improved bermudagrass, or bahiagrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Coastal Plains of Texas and possibly Arkansas and Louisiana (LRR: P, J; MLRA 133B, MLRA 87A).  The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Polk County, Texas; 1983. 

REMARKS:  The series was formerly included in the Lufkin series.  The series was separated based on difference in moisture regime.

In the Range of Characteristics, the Btg and Btgss horizons were changed to exclude the 'g' subsurface designation.  This is believed to have been a previous oversight as the Bt and Btss horizons in the Typical Pedon had already been removed of their 'g' designations.  

This series was updated in 2014 to put into semi-tabular format. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 8 cm (0 to 3 in)(A horizon) 
Argillic horizon: 8 to 76 cm (3 to 30 in)(Bt and Btss horizons)
Paralithic contact: 112 cm (44 in)(2Cry horizons)
Densic bedrock: 112 to 203 cm (91 in)(2Cdy horizons)
Redoximorphic concentrations: 8 to 76 cm (3 to 30 in)(Bt and Btss horizons)
Vertic features: slickensides at 53 to 112 cm (21 to 44 in)(Btss and BCssy horizons)
Episaturation:  8 to 53 cm (3 to 20 in)  (Bt horizons)
Lithologic discontinuity: 112 cm (44 in)(top of the 2Cdy horizons)
Gypsum accumulations: 76 to 203 cm (29 to 80 in)(Btssy, BCssy and 2Cdy horizons)

Additional Comments: Aquic conditions do not exist in this soil in normal years.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data number S80TX-005-009 from Angelina County, Texas.

ADDITIONAL DATA: KSSL Data from type location in Angelina County, Texas-S80TX-005-009.  Particle-size analysis tests were performed at the project office on three pedons. Other data from Angelina County, Texas: KSSL Lab No. S81TX005001.
