HAWICK SERIES

The Hawick series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils formed in sandy outwash sediments with or without a thin loamy mantle. These soils are on outwash plains, stream terraces and glacial moraines. Slope ranges from 2 to 70 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Entic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Hawick sandy loam, on a convex slope of 4 percent, in a cultivated field.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 18 centimeters; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; about 12 percent gravel; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. (17 to 41 centimeters thick)

 Bw--18 to 28 centimeters; dark brown (10YR 3/3) gravelly loamy coarse sand, brown (10YR 4/3) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; about 20 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 40 centimeters thick)

 C--28 to 203 centimeters; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) gravelly coarse sand; single grain; loose; about 30 percent gravel; few, soft, very pale brown (10YR 8/2) accumulations of calcium carbonate on underside of gravel and very coarse sand fragments; strongly effervescent, slightly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) 103-Central Iowa and Minnesota Till Prairies, Meeker County, Minnesota subset; about 4 miles north and 1 mile east of Kingston; located about 160 feet north and 100 feet east of the southwest corner of section 4, T.119 N., R.29 W.; USGS Kingston topographic quadrangle; lat. 45 degrees 08 minutes 21 seconds N. and long. 94 degrees 20 minutes 12 seconds W., NAD 83.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Dakota County, Minnesota, 1980.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 28 centimeters (Ap and Bw horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Entic subgroup--does not have a cambic horizon.

Hawick soils were formerly included in the Salida Series.

Type location moved from Dakota County, Minnesota to Meeker County, Minnesota in 11/96 to better exemplify the series concept within the MLRA.
