HAYMONT SERIES

The Haymont series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources. The Haymont soils are on fan skirts, alluvial flats, axial stream floodplains, and lake plains. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters (4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 17 degees C. (63 degrees F.). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, thermic Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Haymont very fine sandy loam. Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. 

 A--0 to 8 centimeters (0 to 3 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) very fine sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8) clear smooth boundary. (5 to 13 centimeters thick) 

 C1--8 to 25 centimeters (3 to 10 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine interstitial and few fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear smooth boundary. 

 C2--25 to 64 centimeters (10 to 25 inches); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very fine sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots, common fine and few very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6) clear smooth boundary. 

 C3--64 to 102 centimeters (25 to 40 inches); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very fine sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary. 

 C4--102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) highly stratified fine sandy loam and silt loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6). (The combined thickness of the C horizons is 102 to 152 centimeters) 

TYPE LOCATION: Nye County, Nevada; in the northern part of Pahrump Valley; about 632 meters (2,075 feet) south and 84 meters (275 feet) east of the northwest corner of sec. 9 T. 19 S., R. 53 E., 36 degrees, 18 minutes, 28 seconds north latitude and 116 degrees, 1 minute, 45 seconds west longitude. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil moisture: Usually dry, upper part of the soil moisture control section is moist for a short time in late winter and early spring and for 10 to 20 days following summer convection storms between July and mid October. The soils have a typic-aridic soil moisture regime. 

Soil temperature: 15 to 18 degrees C. (59 to 65 degrees F.). 

Calcium carbonates: Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 10 to 35 percent. 

Control section 
Clay content: 5 to 18 percent with less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. 
Rock fragments: Less than 5 percent. 

A horizon: 
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist. 
Chroma: 3 or 4 moist or dry. 

Bw (when present): 
Other features: Bw horizon has structure but does not meet all the requirerments for a Cambic horizon. 

C horizons: 
Value: 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist. 
Chroma: 3 or 4 dry, 4 or 5 moist. 
Texture: Dominantly very fine sandy loam with less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser or silt loam; below 100 centimeters (40 inches) it is stratified fine sandy loam, silt loam, loam or very fine sandy loam; some pedons are not stratified. 
Clay content: 5 to 18 percent. 
Structure: Massive, platy or subangular blocky. 
Consistence: Soft or slightly hard, nonsticky or slightly sticky, and nonplastic or slightly plastic. 
Reaction: Moderately alkaline through very strongly alkaline. 
Other features: Some horizons have 1 to 3 percent visible calcium carbonate or gypsum, in some pedons. 

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. The Garbutt, Largo, Penoyer, Smaug, Tome, and Yipor soils are similar. Garbutt, Penoyer, Smaug, and Yipor soils have a mesic temperature regime. Largo and Tome soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Haymont soils are on fan skirts, alluvial flats, axial stream floodplains, and lake plains. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. Elevations are 700 to 1,070 meters (2,300 to 3,500 feet). The climate is hot and arid with warm, moist winters and hot, dry summers, typical of the Mojave Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 203 millimeters (3 to 8 inches); mean annual air temperature is 15 to 18 degrees C. (60 to 65 degrees F.), and the frost-free season is 180 to 240 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Yermo, Nopah, Pahrump series. Nopah soils are fine-loamy and carbonatic. The Pahrump soils contain more than 35 percent indurated calcium carbonate nodules in the control section. Yermo soils are loamy-skeletal. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well-drained, slow runoff; moderate permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for rangeland, urban development, cropland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly four-wing saltbush, shadscale and Russian-thistle. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southern Nevada; MLRA 30. These soils are not extensive.
