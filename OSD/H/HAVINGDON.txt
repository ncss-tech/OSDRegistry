HAVINGDON SERIES

The Havingdon series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from chert and shale with some influence from loess and volcanic ash. Havingdon soils are on mountain and foothill side slopes and shoulders.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, mesic Xeric Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Havingdon gravelly very fine sandy loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 8 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly very fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine and fine vesicular pores, and few fine tubular pores; 20 percent angular chert gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 10 cm thick)

    A2--8 to 15 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly very fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium and thin platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 25 percent angular chert gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 10 cm thick)

    BA--15 to 25 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine angular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 55 percent angular chert gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (8 to 18 cm thick)

    Bt--25 to 53 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely gravelly clay, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak fine and medium angular blocky structure; hard, very friable, very sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and few coarse roots; common very fine tubular pores; continuous faint clay films bridging sand grains on peds and in pores; 70 percent angular chert gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (15 to 38 cm thick)

    R--53 to 76 cm; fractured chert bedrock with few soft carbonate masses and common thin,clay films along fracture planes; strongly effervescent; few fine roots in fractures; carbonate masses are slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).

Btk horizons (may be present in some pedons)
Secondary carbonates:  Soft masses of carbonate accumulation are in bedrock fractures, but are also in the lower 3 to 5 cm of the Bt horizon in some pedons that are thicker.

R layer
The bedrock is usually well fractured with some roots and thin to moderately thick clay films in the fractures to a depth of up to 30 cm.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Berning, Bilbo, Clenage, Lambranch(, Maderbak, Pula, Pulcan, Surgem, Tanawit, Tenmile, Vanwyper and Zephan series.  

Berning, Bilbo, Lambranch, Pula, Tanawit and Tenmile soils lack bedrock within 100 cm. Clenage soils have 35 to 50 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. . Maderbak soils have soil temperature of 11 to 15 degrees C and receive 10 to 20 days of summer precipitation. Pulcan and Zephan soils lack a lithic contact within 100 cm.  Surgem and Vanwyper soils lack accumulation of secondary carbonates at the lithic contact.  Additionally Vanwyper soils have mainly cobble-sized rock fragments 1n the Bt horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Havingdon soils are on mountain and foothill side slopes.  These soils formed in residuum derived from chert and shale with some influence from loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,400 to 2,010 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 80 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Boulflat, Bucan, Brock and Humdun soils.  Boulflat soils have fine-loamy particle-size control sections and strongly cemented duripans.  Bucan soils have clay Bt horizons with less than 35 percent rock fragments.  Brock soils have calcareous Bt horizons and duripans about at a depth of 50 cm.  Humdun soils have mollic colors in their epipedon, cambic horizons and coarse-loamy particle-size control sections.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly big sagebrush, spiny hopsage, spineless horsebrush, Sandberg bluegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, cheatgrass and basin wildrye.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North central Nevada.  These soils are not extensive. MLRA 24, 25.
