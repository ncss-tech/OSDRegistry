REMARKS: 
These soils were previously included with the Appling series in several surveys. 2006 revision to clean up text only. RHB.  The February 2026 revision changed the formatting only.  No data was changed. DTA
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches) (Ap and E horizons)
Kandic horizon--the zone from 18 to 122 centimeters (7 to 48 inches) has low activity clay in more than 50 percent of the horizon (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 and BC horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 18 to 122 centimeters (7 and 48 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 and BC horizons)
Oxyaquic feature--saturation with water, in one or more layers within one meter of the mineral soil surface, for one month or more per year in 6 or more out of 10 years
