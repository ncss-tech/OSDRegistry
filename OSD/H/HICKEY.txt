HICKEY SERIES

The Hickey series consists of very deep and well drained soils on undulating to rolling glacial moraines.  They formed in glacial till.  Slopes are 0 to 40 percent.  Elevation is 7,500 to 8,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is 36 to 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Ustic Calciargids

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alogia, Anchutz, Antonito, Cushool, Cutback, Fluetsch, Fonce, Grubrob, Rock River, Stunner, and Wycolo series.
Rock River soils do not have a calcic horizon.
Alogia soils contain horizons with gypsum accumulation.
Anchutz soils have strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline reactions.
Antonito and Grubrob soils have a lithic content at 20 to 40 inches.
Cushool, Cutback, and Wycolo soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.
Fluetsch soils have a cryic soil temperature regime.
Fonce soils have soil temperatures of 44 to 47 degrees F. and have less than 27 percent clay in the Bt horizons.
Stunner soils contain less than 35 percent fine or coarser sands.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hickey soils are on undulating and rolling to moderately steep glacial moraines.  Slopes are 0 to 40 percent.  Elevation is 7,500 to 8,500 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 10 to 15 inches with slight highs in March through June.  The average annual air temperature is 36 to 42 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated as 50 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Luhon and Evanston series.  The Luhon soils do not have an argillic horizon, Evanston soils have a mollic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; low to high runoff; moderately permeable.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  A few minor areas have been irrigated for hayland.  Native vegetation is big sagebrush, black sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, junegrass, Idaho fescue, rabbitbrush and phlox.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The footslopes of the Uinta Mountains in Uinta County, Wyoming and Summit County, Utah.  MLRA 34A, 47. The series is moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Henrys Fork soil survey area, Utah and Wyoming, 1990. The series name is from Hickey Mountain.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 4 inches thick (A1 and A2 horizons)
Argillic horizon - from 4 to 30 inches (Bt and Btk horizons)
Calcic horizon - from 8 to 30 inches (Btk horizon)
Particle-size control section - The zone from 4 to 24 inches (upper 20 inches of argillic horizon)
Series control section - The zone from 0 to 60 inches.

The temperature regime is estimated from data available in vicinity. The moisture regime is interpolated from 2 year data in the immediate area and longer records from other locations in the vicinity and estimated from the vegetation. (Note during 03/2007 revision: . As originally written, the mean summer temperature crossed from frigid to cryic. The temperature regime is not clear. The air temperatures, elevations,  and associated soils suggest this series is more appropriately in a cryic regime. Vegetation and precipitation suggest this series is in an ustic regime rather than aridic; map unit descriptions range as high as 18 inches of precipitation. The climate regimes of this series need further study.)

The classification of the Hickey series when established was fine-loamy, mixed, frigid Borollic Haplargids.
