HETTINGER SERIES

The Hettinger series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils formed in glaciolacustrine deposits on lake plains and glacial drainage channels. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, nonacid, frigid Mollic Epiaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Hettinger loam, in a forest. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated).

 A--0 to 20 cm (8 inches); black (10YR 2/1) loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; friable; neutral; clear wavy boundary. [10 to 25 cm (4 to 10 inches) thick]

 Bg1--20 to 36 cm (8 to 14 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay loam; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; firm; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

 Bg2--36 to 46 cm (14 to 18 inches); gray (10YR 5/1) stratified silty clay loam and silt loam with thin layers of clay loam and clay; moderate medium angular blocky structure; firm; common coarse faint dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) iron depletions; common coarse prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; slightly alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bg horizon is 15 to 66 cm (6 to 26 inches) thick.]

 Cg--46 to 152 cm (18 to 60 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) stratified silty clay loam and silt loam with thin layers of clay and clay loam; massive; firm; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Arenac County, Michigan; 500 feet west and 200 feet north of the center of sec. 18, T. 20 N., R. 7 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Thickness of the solum: dominantly 46 to 71 cm (18 to 28 inches), but ranges from 30 to 91 cm ( 12 to 36 inches)
Depth to carbonates: dominantly 46 to 71 cm (18 to 28 inches), but ranges from 30 to 91 cm ( 12 to 36 inches)
Particle-size control section: averages 27 to 35 percent clay

A or Ap horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 2, 2.5, or 3
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: loam, mucky loam, clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam
Reaction: slightly acid to moderately alkaline


Bg horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR to 2.5Y
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: silty clay loam or clay loam, or less commonly stratified with thin strata of silty clay, clay, silt, or silt loam
Reaction: slightly acid to moderately alkaline

Some pedons have BC horizons. 

C horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 5 or 6
Chroma: 1 to 4
Texture: dominantly silty clay loam or clay loam containing thin strata of variable textures, most commonly silt, silt loam, and clay

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Hettinger soils are on lake plains and glacial drainage channels of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Hettinger soils formed in glaciolacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 762 mm (28 to 30 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 5.6 to 7.8 degrees C (42 to 46 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bowers, Bruce, Kawkawlin, Nester, Nunica, and Sims soils. The well drained or moderately well drained Nunica soils and the somewhat poorly drained Bowers soils are in the same drainage sequence with the Hettinger soils. The coarser-textured, poorly drained or very poorly drained Bruce soils are on nearby lake plains. The finer-textured, moderately well drained Nester soils, somewhat poorly drained Kawkawlin soils, and poorly drained or very poorly drained Sims soils are on nearby moraines and till plains.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained or very poorly drained. Potential for surface runoff is medium or high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low. Permeability is slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: A small part is used for growing small grain, grass-legume hay, and corn. A greater part is used for permanent pasture, or is in woodland. Native vegetation is mostly black ash, white ash, red maple, silver maple, and quaking aspen. In the northern parts of its range, some yellow birch, northern whitecedar, white spruce, and balsam fir occurs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 93B, 94A, 94B, 94C, 96, and 98 in central and northern Lower Michigan and the Upper Peninsula. The series is of moderate extent.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon (mollic intergrade): from the surface to a depth of 20 cm (8 inches) (A horizon).
Cambic horizon: from a depth of 20 to 46 cm (8 to 18 inches) (Bg1 and Bg2 horizons).
Aquic conditions: reduced matrix color and/or redoximorphic features in all horizons below the ochric epipedon.
