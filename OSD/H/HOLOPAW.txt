HOLOPAW SERIES

The Holopaw series consists of deep and very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soil that formed in sandy and loamy marine sediments. Holopaw soils are on nearly level low lying flats, poorly defined drainageways and depressional areas. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1397 millimeters (55 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F).
