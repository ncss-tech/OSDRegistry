HAYCAMP SERIES

The Haycamp series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from interbeded sandstone and shale.  Haycamp soils are on mountain slopes and canyons.  Slopes range from 30 to 80 percent.   Mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic Typic Haplocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Haycamp cobbly clay loam, on a west facing, 48 percent slope in spruce-fir and aspen woodland at an elevation of 9,500 feet.  Described on August 8, 1985.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

USE AND VEGETATION:  Haycamp soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing, and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation consists of Engelmann's spruce, subalpine fir, quaking aspen, whortleberry, and American vetch.  Grasses and forbs are mainly mountain brome and nodding brome, Letterman needlegrass, wheatgrass, aspen peavine, elk sedge, and meadow rue.
