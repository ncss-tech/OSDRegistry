HAYFORK SERIES

The Hayfork series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous clayey and loamy alluvium derived from Permian age redbed sediments.  These nearly level soils are on flood plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Similar soils are the Clearfork, Miller, Nipsum, and Westfork series.
Clearfork soils: These soils have a fine-silty particle-size control section.
Miller soils: These soils have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick and have vertic properties.
Nipsum soils: These soils do not flood.
Westfork soils: These soils are moist for longer periods and are noncalcareous above 28 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: Holocene age alluvium derived from Permian age redbed sediments.
Landform: Flood plain
Slope: 0 to 1 percent
Mean annual air temperature range: 60 to 64 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation range: 22 to 26 inches
Frost-free period: 205 to 230 days

Thornthwaite annual P-E indices: 32 to 40

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Beckman, Cottonwood, Knoco, Mangum, Nipsum, Talpa, and Vernon series.
Beckman and Mangum soils: These soils occur on flood plains slightly lower in the landscape and have an ochric epipedon.
Cottonwood, Knoco, and Talpa soils: These soils occur on higher upland areas and are less than 20 inches to bedrock.
Nipsum soils: This soil occurs on slightly higher footslope positions that do not flood.
Vernon soils: This soil occurs on higher upland areas, is less than 40 inches to bedrock, and has an ochric epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is slow.  Runoff is medium.  This soil is rarely flooded for very brief periods.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mostly for livestock grazing.  Native vegetation consists of short and mid grasses.  Western wheatgrass, vine mesquite, sideoats grama, blue grama, and buffalograss are the dominant species.  Mesquite has invaded most areas.  Some areas are used for cropland.  Wheat and cotton are the main crops.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwest Oklahoma and possibly north Texas; LRR H; MLRA 78B and C; Small extent
