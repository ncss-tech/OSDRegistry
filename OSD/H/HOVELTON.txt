HOVELTON SERIES

The Hovelton series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils with moderately slow permeability that formed in colluvium and residuum from basalt and welded tuff mixed with volcanic ash. Slopes range from 25 to 65 percent in foothills. The average annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Vitrandic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Hovelton cobbly ashy loam -- on a west-facing slope of 40 percent at 3,900 feet elevation in rangeland. The surface has about 2 percent stone cover. When described on August 25, 1994, the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

   A--0 to 2 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) cobbly ashy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium and thick platy structure parting to moderate fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine irregular, few very fine and fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 10 inches thick)

   AB--2 to 6 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) cobbly ashy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to strong fine and medium granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick)

   Bt1--6 to 13 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very cobbly ashy loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; few distinct clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick)

   Bt2--13 to 24 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) extremely stony clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; strong fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; common prominent clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 20 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles, 30 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.0); clear irregular boundary. (8 to 22 inches thick)

   R--24 inches; fractured basalt.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ackna (T), Blint, Brysill (T), Bunselmeier, Cubhill, Hehe, Lainand, Leidl, McDaniel, Millhouse (T), Nint (T), Norod and Skooker series. Ackna, Brysill, Bunselmeier, Cubhill, McDaniel and Millhouse soils are very deep. Blint soils are dry for 90 to 100 consecutive days and have a mollic epipedon 20 to 25 inches thick. Hehe soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Lainand soils are deep to a lithic contact. Leidl soils have base saturation less than 75 percent in some part of the solum and average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Nint soils have a mollic epipedon 20 to 35 inches thick. Norod soils are dry for 100 to 120 consecutive days and have secondary carbonates at 25 to 38 inches. Skooker soils are deep to a paralithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hovelton soils are on hill backslopes and volcanic cone slopes at elevations of 2,600 to 5,750 feet. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from basalt and welded tuff mixed with volcanic ash. Slopes range from 25 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is 13 to 22 inches. The average annual temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free period is 90 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing McDaniel soils and the Duco, Hann, Hillcreek and McDesh soils. Duco soils are on hill shoulders and backslopes and are shallow to bedrock. Hann soils are on hill backslopes and footslopes and are very deep and clayey. Hillcreek soils are on hill backslopes and are very deep and loamy. McDesh soils are on hill backslopes and are clayey. McDaniel soils are on similar geomorphic positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; very rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Hovelton soils are used mainly for rangeland. Native vegetation is xeric big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass and Idaho fescue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West-central Idaho. MLRA 10. Hovelton soils are not extensive.
