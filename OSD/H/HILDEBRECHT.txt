HILDEBRECHT SERIES

The Hildebrecht series consist of very deep, moderately well drained soils on ridgetops and side slopes. They formed in loess over residuum weathered from dolomite. Permeability is moderate above the fragipan and slow or very slow in the fragipan. Slopes are 1 to 15 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 15 degrees C. (56 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1067 mm (42 inches).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Apalona, Ava, Bedford, Buston, Cincinnati, Fountainville, Grantsburg, Hosmer, Lawrenceville, Nicholson, Omulga, Otwell, Otwood, Solsberry, Weisburg, and Zanesville soils. Apalona soils have a Bt/E horizon above the fragipan. Ava soils have less than 4 percent rock fragments in the fragipan. Bedford soils have a paleosol (3Btb) horizon below the fragipan. Boston soils are typically 50 to 70 inches to a lithic contact and are calcareous below the fragipan. Cincinnati soils have carbonates from 122 to 325 centimeters (48 to 128 inches) and contain glacial pebbles below the fragipan. Fountainville soils have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches. Grantsburg soils do not have rock fragemtns. Hosmer soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the fragipan and below and formed in loess more than 1.2 meters (4 feet) thick. Lawrenceville soils have less than 10 percent rock fragments in the solum. Nicholson, Omulga, Otwell, Otwood, Solsberry, and Weisburg soils contain less than 15 percent rock fragments in the fragipan. Zanesville soils have a lithic contact from 102 to 203 centimeters (40 to 80 inches), and contain less than 15 percent rock fragments in the fragipan.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hildebrecht soils are on convex upland ridgetops, point ridges, heads of drains and side slopes. Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent. These soils formed in loess over residuum from dolomite. Mean annual temperature ranges from 12.8 to 15 degrees C (55 to 59 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1143 (40 to 45 inches).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Goss, Union, and Wilderness soils. Goss soils are loamy-skeletal and do not have fragipans.  They are on side slopes below the Hildebrecht soils. Union soils are fine. Wilderness soils are loamy-skeletal.  Union and Wilderness soils and are on similar positions.  

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. Runoff is high to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part and moderately low or low in the fragipan.

USE AND VEGETATION: Some Hildebrecht soils are cleared and used for pasture, hay, and cultivated crops. Tall fescue and orchardgrass are the principal grasses grown; and corn, grain sorghum, and wheat are the principal cultivated crops. The remaining areas are in hardwood forest. Native vegetation was hardwood forest dominated by oaks.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern part of Ozark Highland, MLRA 116A and the St. Francois Knobs and Basins, MLRA 116C of Missouri. The series is of moderate extent, more than 22,258 hectares (55,000 acres) have been mapped to date.
