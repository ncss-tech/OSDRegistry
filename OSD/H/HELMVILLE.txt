HELMVILLE SERIES

The Helmville series consist of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from limestone, argillite, and igneous rocks.  These soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 2 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Eutric Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Helmville cobbly loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; forest litter, slightly decomposed.

    E--2 to 10 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) cobbly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine discontinuous irregular pores; 15 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual wavy boundary. (5 to 15 inches thick)

    Bt1--10 to 14 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) very cobbly clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak medium granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine, common medium, and few coarse roots; many very fine and fine discontinuous irregular pores; many thin continuous clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick)

    Bt2--14 to 25 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) very cobbly clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine discontinuous irregular pores; many thin continuous clay films on faces of peds; 25 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (9 to 20 inches thick)

    Bk--25 to 60 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) very cobbly clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine discontinuous irregular pores; 30 percent gravel and 30 percent cobbles; finely disseminated calcium carbonate, continuous distinct calcium carbonate coating on gravel and cobbles, and faint and distinct calcium carbonate casts on undersides of the rock fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - mountain slopes
Elevation - 4,600 to 8,600 feet
Slope - 2 to 70 percent
Parent material - colluvium and alluvium derived from limestone, argillite, and igneous rocks
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers
Mean annual precipitation - 19 to 40 inches
Mean annual air temperature - 35 to 40 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Worock and the Relyea series. Relyea soils are clayey-skeletal. These soils are on similar landform positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Helmville soils are used for timber production, watershed, and wildlife.  The native vegetation is mainly Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine, subalpine fir, pinegrass, heartleaf arnica, white spiraea, western meadowrue, Englemann aster, common snowberry, beargrass, blue huckleberry, and grouse whortleberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Helmville soils are of moderate extent in western and southwestern Montana.  MLRAs - 43A, 43B.
