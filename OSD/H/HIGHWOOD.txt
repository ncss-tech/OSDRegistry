HIGHWOOD SERIES  

The Highwood series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium from mixed igneous rock sources.  These soils occur on mountain slopes and structural benches.  Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 700 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Eutric Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Highwood gravelly loam, in forest on a 35 percent northwest slope at an elevation of 1646 meters (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

 Oi--0 to 4 cm; slightly decomposed forest litter; clear smooth boundary. (3 to 6 cm thick)

 A--4 to 12 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; few very fine and fine irregular pores; 20 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 15 cm thick)

 BtE--12 to 33 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very cobbly clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; few (10 percent) patchy clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.8); gradual wavy boundary. (15 to 30 cm thick) 

 Bt1--33 to 64 cm; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) very cobbly clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; many (55 percent) distinct clay films on faces of peds; 25 percent gravel and 25 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.8); gradual wavy boundary. (20 to 40 cm thick) 

 Bt2--64 to 150 cm; olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) cobbly clay loam, dark olive brown (2.5Y 3/3) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; many (60 percent) distinct clay films on faces of peds; 15 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.8).
