HATKNOLL SERIES

The Hatknoll series consists of very deep, well drained soils on fan terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium from basalt and pyroclastics.  Slope is 1 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 56 degrees.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Typic Calciargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Hatknoll silty clay loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/3) silty clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak thin platy structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 5 inches thick)

    Bt1--3 to 12 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) silty clay, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; strong fine prismatic structure parting to strong fine subangular blocky; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; common thin clay films on ped faces and in pores; 5 percent gravel; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt2--12 to 20 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) silty clay, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; strong fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; common moderately thick clay films on ped faces and in pores; 5 percent gravel; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)

    Bt3--20 to 25 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) gravelly silty clay, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; strong fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; common thin clay films on ped faces and in pores; 20 percent gravel; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 9 inches thick)

    2Bk1--25 to 36 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure with discontinuous areas of weak thin platy; very hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent, few fine soft lime masses; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 15 inches thick)

    2B--36 to 60 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure with discontinuous areas of weak thin platy; very hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent, lime disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hatknoll soils are on fan terraces at elevations of 4,700 to 5,000 feet.  They formed in alluvium from basalt and pyroclastics.  Slopes range from 1 to 10 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 7 to 11 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 55 to 57 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 165 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brinkerhoff, Clayhole, Grieta, Jocity, Kinan and Moab series.  Brinkerhoff and Clayhole soils have horizons high in gypsum.  Grieta and Jocity soils are fine-loamy.  Kinan soils are coarse-loamy.  Moab soils are loamy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained;  slow or medium runoff;  slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for livestock grazing.  Vegetation is mainly galleta, green rabbitbrush, snakeweed and fourwing saltbush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Arizona. MLRA is 35. The series is of small extent.
