HINDES SERIES

The Hindes series consists of very deep, well drained soils.  These  These nearly level to gently rolling clayey and gravelly soils formed in the Uvalde Gravel of Pliocene or Pleistocene age..

Highway 90 in Uvalde; 15.3 miles east on Farm Road 1023; 0.5 mile south; 1,000 feet east of fence line corner, 50 feet north of fence in rangeland.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  

Soil Moisture: An aridic ustic moisture regime.  The soil moisture control section is moist in some or all parts for less than 90 consecutive days in normal years.  June to August and December to February are the driest months, while September to November and March to May are the wettest months.
Solum thickness ranges from 150 (60 in) to more than 200 (80 in).  
Depth to secondary calcium carbonate: 51 to 114 cm (20 to 45 in).

A Horizon
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 3 to 5
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, and its gravelly to extremely gravelly counterparts 
Coarse fragments: amount-15 to 75 percent by volume; size-pebbles and cobbles; kind-siliceous
Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline.

Bt or Btk (where present) Horizon
Hue: 2.5YR to 10YR
Value: 3 or 4
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, and its gravelly to extremely gravelly counterparts 
Clay content: 35 to 55 percent
Coarse fragments: amount-35 to 80 percent by volume; size-pebbles and cobbles; kind-siliceous
Identifiable secondary carbonate: Some pedons contain films and threads or masses of calcium carbonate in the lower Bt horizon.
Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline


BCk Horizon
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 6 to 8
Chroma: 1 to 4
Texture: loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, and its gravelly to extremely gravelly counterparts; weakly cemented in the upper part with less than 10 cm (4 in) wide.
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline

Some pedons have 2BCk or C horizons that have seams of soft sandstone.  Horizontal fractures in the upper part are less than 10 cm (4 in) apart.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Similar soils include the Zavco (TX) series. 
Zavco soils: contain less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the Bt horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: formed in clayey and gravelly sediments of the Uvalde Gravel of Pliocene or early Pleistocene age.  
Landform: paleoterraces 
Slope: 0 to 12 percent but are mainly less than 4 percent
Mean annual air temperature range: 20.6 to 22.2 degrees C (69 to 72 degrees F).
Mean annual precipitation range: 508 to 635 mm (20 to 25 in) 
Precipitation Pattern: The majority of the yearly rainfall occurs during the months of May through October. The winter months are typically the driest.
Frost-free period: 240 to 280 days 
Elevation: 48 to 289.6 m (157 to 950 ft) 
Thornthwaite annual P-E indices: 25 to about 35

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Yologo (TX) and Zavco (TX) series and the Olmos (TX) and Valco (TX) series.  
Olmos and Valco soils: have petrocalcic horizons; calcareous throughout; on a similar landform.  
Valco and Zavco soils: occur at lower elevations.
Yologo soils: shallow over petrocalcic horizon on a similar landform

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Runoff is negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes, very low on 1 to 3 percent slopes, low on 3 to 5 percent slopes, and medium on 5 to 12 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for rangeland.  Native vegetation consists of mid grasses, a few short grasses, about 25 percent woody shrubs and 5 percent perennial forbs.  With retrogression woody plants dominate, mostly blackbrush, and form a dense canopy. Other increasers and invaders are threeawn, hairy grama, and red grama. Gravelly Ridge 20 to 35 inch PZ; R083AY386TX

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Rio Grande Plains (MLRA 83A); moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Uvalde County, Texas; 1970.

REMARKS:  Hindes soils have been included with the Webb gravelly soils in earlier published surveys of Frio, Zavala, Dimmit, and Maverick Counties, Texas. The series was updated during the correlation of the initial soil survey of McMullen County, Texas. Depths were originally in English units.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon--0 to 38 cm (0 to 15 in) (A and Bt1 horizons).

Argillic horizon-20 to 79 cm (8 to 31 in) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).

Calcic horizon-79 to 157 cm (31 to 62 in) (BCk horizon).

Skeletal feature--more than 35 percent by volume of fragments in particle-size control section.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Particle-size and chemical properties analysis  were performed at the project office for the initial soil survey of McMullen County on pedons S10TX3112575, S09TX3115002, and S10TX3115002.
