HOULIHAN SERIES

The Houlihan series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, slope alluvium, and colluvium derived from igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rock. Houlihan soils are on hills, mountain slopes, swales and fan remnants. Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 480 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Pachic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Houlihan loam on an 8 percent south facing slope, in rangeland at about 2067 meters elevation (colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated).

  A1--0 to 18 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.

  A2--18 to 38 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine and medium granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of A horizons - 25 to 85 cm)

  Bw1--38 to 58 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (20 to 60 cm)

  Bw2--58 to 152 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) cobbly clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 10 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0).
