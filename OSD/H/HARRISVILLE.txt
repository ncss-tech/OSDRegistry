HARRISVILLE SERIES

The Harrisville series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained or moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Harrisville soils are on low lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TYPE LOCATION:  Weber County, Utah; about 1.75 miles west-southwest of North Ogden; approximately 300 feet north and 600 feet east of the center of section 31, T. 7 N., R. 1 W.; USGS North Ogden 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; 41 degrees 18 minutes 01 seconds north latitude and 111 degrees 59 minutes 36 seconds west longitude, NAD27; UTM zone 12N 416772E, 4572563N, NAD83.

Soil moisture - Typically moist in winter and spring, dry in summer and fall; the soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for more than 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice; Xeric moisture regime that borders on aridic.

Mean annual soil temperature - 47 to 54 degrees F.

Mollic epipedon thickness - 7 to 9 inches.

Depth to calcic horizon - 12 to 18 inches. 

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 27 to 32 percent.

Redoximorphic features - Faint to prominent redox concentrations of iron at depths ranging from 30 to 42 inches.


Ap or A horizon - Values: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.
Texture: Silt loam or silty clay loam.
Organic matter content: 2 to 5 percent.
Effervescence: Noneffervescent or slightly effervescent.

Other features: Some pedons have texture of very gravelly loam below 40 inches; these horizons are massive or have rock structure of finely laminated lacustrine sediments.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.  The Fridlo series is in a different but similar family and also differs on thickness of the mollic epipedon and depth to the calcic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Harrisville soils are on smooth to undulating low lake terraces.  These soils have formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from sedimentary rocks such as limestone and sandstone; igneous rocks such as granite; and metamorphic rocks such as quartzite and gneiss.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  Elevations range from 4,250 to 4,500 feet.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 18 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is 68 to 72 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 120 to 170 days.
 
GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ironton, Leland, and Logan soils.  Ironton soils are coarse-loamy and do not have natric horizons.  Leland soils have ochric epipedons.  Logan soils are poorly drained and do not have natric horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained or moderately well drained; medium surface runoff; slow permeability (moderately low or moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity).  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 2.5 and 5 feet (moderately deep and deep free water occurrence classes) between April and September.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Harrisville soils are used for rangeland, irrigated cropland, and urban development.  Irrigated areas are used for growing alfalfa, small grains, sugar beets, and improved pasture.  The native vegetation in rangeland is mainly Sandberg's bluegrass, inland saltgrass, foxtail, gumweed, peppergrass, black greasewood, and Wyoming big sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Utah.  These soils are not extensive with about 7,200 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 28A.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 8 inches (Ap horizon).

Natric horizon - The zone from 8 to 22 inches (Btn and Btkn horizons).

Calcic horizon - The zone from 14 to 33 inches (Btkn and Bkn horizons).

Endosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 30 and 60 inches at certain times during normal years (parts of the Bkn, C1, and C2 horizons).

Particle-size control section - The zone from 8 to 22 inches (Btn and Btkn horizons).


This revision of February 2006 updates the taxonomic class from Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Mollic Natrustalfs based on the presence of a mollic epipedon and the assumed moisture regime being xeric instead of ustic.

The superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has partial characterization data by the Soils Laboratory from Utah State University (USU) Logan, UT and is published on pages 138-139, Table 11 of the Soil Survey of Davis-Weber Area, Utah.  The pH values in the typical pedon are from the original pedon description.
