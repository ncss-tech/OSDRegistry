HOYPUS SERIES

The Hoypus series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in glacial outwash. These soils are on outwash plains and hillslopes and have slopes of 3 to 50 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, isotic, mesic Typic Xerorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hoypus gravelly sandy loam, forested, located at 190 feet elevation. When described on June 16, 2004 the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted. All textures are apparent field textures.)

    Oi--0 to 1 inches; slightly decomposed needles and twigs; abrupt smooth boundary.

    A--1 to 5 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine to medium and common coarse roots; many very fine and fine irregular and interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.4); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick)

    Bw1--5 to 20 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) loamy sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; single grained; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine, medium and common coarse roots; many very fine to medium interstitial and irregular pores; 10 percent gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.3); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick)

    Bw2--20 to 36 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) very gravelly loamy sand, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; single grained; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; many very fine to medium irregular and interstitial pores; 55 percent gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.5); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 18 inches thick)

    C--36 to 60 inches; variegated colors 50 percent light, 30 percent dark, 20 percent medium, extremely gravelly sand; single grained; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; many very fine irregular and interstitial pores; 60 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.9).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this family.  Similar soils with mixed mineralogy include the Atter, Carlsborg, Marblespring, Spens, and Valcreek series. Atter soils are dry for over 90 days in the summer and have a mean annual soil temperature of 52 to 59 degrees F. Carlsborg soils have 60 to 85 percent rock fragments including 15 to 30 percent cobbles in the control section.  Marblespring soils have albic materials (E horizons) and lamellae. Spens soils lack a B horizon and have a solum less than 10 inches thick.  Valcreek soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hoypus soils are on hillslopes and glacial outwash plains at elevations of 0 to 1,000 feet. Slopes are 3 to 50 percent. These soils formed in glacial outwash. The climate is characterized by cool, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Average annual precipitation is 18 to 30 inches. Average January temperature is 38 degrees F., average July temperature is 60 degrees F., and the average annual temperature is 49 degrees F. The frost-free season is 200 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Agnew, Cassolary, Catla, Whidbey, Dick, LaConner, Roche and the competing Carlsborg soils. Agnew and Cassolary soils are very deep and found on terraces and terrace escarpments. Catla soils are shallow to a densic contact and found on hills and till plains. Whidbey soils are moderately deep to a densic contact and are found on hills. Dick soils are very deep and found on outwash plains. LaConner soils are moderately deep to a densic contact and are found on till plains and terraces. Roche soils are moderately deep to a densic contact and are found on hills and outwash plains. Carlsborg soils are very deep and found on river terraces and old alluvial fans.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; moderately rapid permeability in the A Horizon and very rapid permeability in the Bw and C horizons.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Timber production and homesites are the principal uses. Small areas are used for pasture. Potential natural vegetation consists of Douglas-fir and Pacific madrone. Understory species include Oregon grape, oceanspray, bald hip rose, brackenfern, honeysuckle, blackcap, and strawberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Washington. Series is moderately extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Island County, Washington, 1950.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and other features:
Ochric epipedon - 0 to 5 inches
Particle size control section - 10 to 40 inches

The Bw horizons are too coarse textured to meet cambic horizon criteria. Sub horizons of the Bw horizon with sandy loam textures are less than 6 inches thick.
