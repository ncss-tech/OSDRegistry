HUSTON SERIES

The Huston series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils with moderately rapid permeability that formed in alluvium from igneous rocks. Slopes range from 8 to 65 percent in canyons and mountain valleys. The average annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the average annual temperature is about 46 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Ultic Haploxerolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Huston gravelly coarse sandy loam, forested -- on a 55 percent convex southwest-facing slope at 3,175 feet elevation. The surface has about 2 percent stone cover. When described on August 28, 1997, the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(0 to 14 inches thick)

   Bw--26 to 46 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine, few medium irregular and tubular pores; 35 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; 25 percent pararock fragments; slightly acid (pH 6.1); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 20 inches thick) 

   C--46 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) stratified very gravelly coarse sandy loam and very gravelly loamy coarse sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine, few medium irregular and tubular pores; 35 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; 25 percent pararock fragments; discontinuous lamellae between some strata, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; 2 to 5 mm thick, 1 to 4 inches apart; slightly acid (pH 6.3); clear smooth boundary.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bald, Briedwell, Fivelakes, Lyville, Mowako, Rockford, Spokel and Suta series. Baldsoils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact. Briedwell soils average 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have an average annual soil temperature of 50 to 53 degrees F. Fivelakes soils do not have an O horizon, are neutral throughout and dry 90 to 105 days. Lyville soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a lithic contact and dry 90 to 105 days. Mowako soils average 18 to 30 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact. Rockford soils average 18 to 30 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Spokel soils are dry 45 to 65 days and are dominated by greater than 60 percent angular granitic gravel size fragments in the particle-size control section and have no stratification of textures in the substratum within 60 inches. Suta soils average 18 to 23 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are 40 to 60 inches deep to a lithic contact. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Huston soils are strongly sloping to very steep on dominantly south-facing fan remnant escarpments at elevations of 2,700 to 5,000 feet. These soils formed in  old alluvium from igneous (dominantly granitic) rocks. Slopes range from 8 to 65 percent. Average annual precipitation is 20 to 26 inches. Average annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F. Frost-free period is 90 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Stardust and Zeb soils. Stardust soils are fine-loamy and occur on summits of fan remnants. Zeb soils are frigid and occur on north-facing slopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Huston soils are used mainly for timber production. Native vegetation is ponderosa pine and common snowberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West-central Idaho. MLRA 44. Huston soils are of small extent.
