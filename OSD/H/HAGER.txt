HAGER SERIES

The Hager series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from basalt and tuff. Hager soils are on lava plateaus. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the annual temperature is about 8 degrees C

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Arbidge, Dacker, Deerlodge, Ditchcamp, Drysel, Exel, Idow, Lojet, Rakane, Snowmore, Wako, Wellsed, and Wendell series. 

Arbidge, Dacker, Deerlodge, Lojet, and Rakane soils do not have lithic contacts within 150 cm of the soil surface. Ditchcamp, Snowmore, and Wendell soils have lithic contacts within 100 cm of the soil surface. Drysel soils do not have lithic contacts within 150 cm of the soil surface, have mean annual soil temperature of 11 to 13 degrees C, and do not have firm, brittle horizons above the duripan. Exel soils do not have lithic contacts within 150 cm of the soil surface, do not have secondary carbonates, and have slightly acid or neutral reaction. Idow soils have calcic horizons above the duripan and have duripans that are greater than 46 cm thick. Wako soils have calcic horizons above the duripan and have mean annual soil temperature of 10 to 12 degrees C. Wellsed soils do not have lithic contacts within 150 cm of the soil surface and have mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 14 cm degrees C. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hager soils are on lava plateaus. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from basalt and tuff. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,345 to 1,590 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 110 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the McConnel, Old Camp, Pait, and Riddleranch soils. None of these soils have duripans. McConnel soils are very deep, sandy-skeletal, have cambic horizons, and occur on lake terraces. Old Camp soils are loamy-skeletal and are shallow to lithic contacts. Pait soils are loamy-skeletal, very deep, have mollic epipedons and cambic horizons, and are on fan remnants beneath escarpments. Riddleranch soils are loamy-skeletal, moderately deep to lithic contacts, and have mollic epipedons and cambic horizons. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; high surface runoff; moderately slow permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Hager soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, Indian ricegrass, spiny hopsage, and Thurber's needlegrass. Areas with an A horizon less than 13 cm thick support black sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, and Sandberg's bluegrass. The above two plant communities occur in complex. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Oregon. These soils are not extensive with about 8,500 acres of the series mapped to data. MLRA 23.
