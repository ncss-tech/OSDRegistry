HERMLEIGH SERIES


The Hermleigh series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in calcareous clayey Quaternary lacustrine deposits. These soils are in enclosed depressions on alluvial plain remnants. These nearly level soils are 3 to 25 feet below the surrounding plain and range in size from 5 to 150 acres.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. Similar soils are the Eastall, Larzare, Lipan, Padgett, Randall, Reap, and Stamford series.

Lipan: deep wide cracks that remain open for more than 150 cumulative days each year, occur in the Edwards Plateau region of Texas
Randall: occur on the Blackwater Draw formation of Pleistocene age, have a mean annual precipitation of 19 inches or less
Padgett: have deep wide cracks that remain open for more than 150 cumulative days each year, are moderately well drained and occur on floodplains
Reap: are well drained, and occur in broad valleys
Stamford: moderately deep, have hues of 5YR or redder throughout the A horizon, are well drained, and have cracks that remain open for more than 150 cumulative days

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: calcareous clayey Quaternary lacustrine deposits derived from Quaternary and Tertiary material
Landform: in depressions 3 to 25 feet below the surrounding plain and range in size from 5 to more than 150 acres. 
Slope: 0 to 1 percent
Mean annual air temperature range: 59 to 65 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation range: 18 to 25 inches
Precipitation Pattern: Precipitation falls mostly during the months of April through October. November through March is the driest months. Spring precipitation occurs during widely scattered intense thunderstorms.  
Frost-free period: 200 to 240 days
Elevation: 1500 to 2850 feet
Thornthwaite annual P-E indices: 25 to 36

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Pyron, Sagerton, Roscoe and the tentative Dermott and Snyder series. 
Pyron: occurs higher in the landscape and is a Mollisol without slickensides.
Sagerton: occurs higher in the landscape and is a Mollisol without slickensides.
Roscoe: occurs on similar to higher landscape positions and have lower value and chromas in the upper part of the solumn.
Snyder: occurs higher in the landscape and is a Mollisol without slickensides.
Dermott: occurs higher in the landscape on shoulders, summits and breaks into valleys and drains. It is shallow to a petrocalcic.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained, very slow permeability, negligible runoff.  These soils are frequently ponded for very brief to very long periods.  Long or very long duration ponding occurs in most years. After being ponded for a few days, the soil saturates at the surface, forms a perched water table, and wets deeper over time under sustained inundation.

USE AND VEGETATION: Much of the soil is used for growing dryland cotton, grain sorghums, and wheat and rangeland. Principal vegetation in uncultivated areas is buffalograss, tobosa and a few stunted mesquite trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwest portion of the Rolling Red Plains; Land Resource Region H; MLRA 78B and 78C; the series is not extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Scurry County, Texas, 2005, MLRA 78 soil survey area. The name is from a community in Scurry county.

REMARKS: The series was formerly included in the Lipan series. The series was separated from Lipan based on geographic area and parent materials.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle Size Control Section for this pedon: 10 to 40 in.
Ochric Epipedon: 0 to 5 inches (A horizon)
Cambic Horizon: 5 to 32 inches (Bw and Bss horizons)

Vertic feature: 13 to 89 inches (Bss and Bkss horizons) wedge-shaped aggregates and slickensides. Deep wide cracks that are open for less than 150 cumulative days in most years. Gilgai micro relief on undisturbed areas.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data number S03TX-415-001 from Scurry County, Texas.
