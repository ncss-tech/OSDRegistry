HORSETHIEF SERIES

The Horsethief series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in very stony and cobbly colluvium, and slope alluvium derived from sandstone, shale, volcanic, and igneous rocks.  Horsethief soils are on cuestas, hogbacks, and mountain slopes. Slopes range from 10 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.

Tuckerville soils have the top of the argillic horizon less than 24  inches from the mineral soil surface. 
Nordicol soils have a dark A horizon over 10 inches thick.  
Weminuche soils have a loamy control section and have hue of 5YR or redder.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation consists of Engelmann's spruce, subalpine fir, aspen, Rocky Mountain Douglas fir, white fir, whortleberry, mountain snowberry, Thurber fescue, Arizona fescue, and mountain brome.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Colorado.  LRR E, MLRA 48A.  This series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  La Plata County Area, Colorado, 1982.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 2 to 24 inches.  (A, E1, and E2 horizons)
Argillic horizon:  The zone from 32 to 49 inches.  (Bt horizon)
Pale feature:  The top of the argillic horizon is 24 inches or more below the mineral surface.
Particle size control section:  the zone from 32 to 49 inches.  (the argillic horizon)

Keys to Soil Taxonomy:  Classified according to the Eighth Edition, 1998

Type location is moved from La Plata Soil Survey Area to Animas-Dolores Soil Survey Area in 1996.

The 4/2002 revision narrows the series concept to include only a typic-udic moisture regime. Outwash and till were also deleted from the parent materials. Vegetation was revised to reflect only the vegetation representative of typic-udic. It is recognized that more narrowing of the concept is needed, particularly to exclude soil properties that correspond to the precip zones and parent materials that are no longer part of the series.
