HATUR SERIES

The Hatur series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone and dolostone.  Hatur soils are on mountain side slopes.  Slopes are l5 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic Typic Cryrendolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hatur very gravelly loam--rangeland (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 10 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many medium, fine, and very fine roots; common fine interstitial and common fine tubular pores; 40 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary.  (8 to 18 cm thick)

    A2--10 to 25 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many medium, fine, and very fine roots; common fine and very fine tubular pores; 45 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (13 to 28 cm thick)

    Bw--25 to 48 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common medium and fine roots; common medium and fine tubular pores; 65 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth boundary.  (13 to 28 cm thick)

    C--48 to 89 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine interstitial pores; 65 percent gravel and l0 percent cobbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (18 to 43 cm thick)

    R--89 cm; limestone.

TYPE LOCATION:  Eureka County, Nevada; approximately 32 miles northwest of Eureka; about 1,200 feet north and 800 feet west of the southeast corner of section 32., T., 23 N., R. 50 E.; USGS Roberts Creek Mountain 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle latitude 39 degrees 48 minutes 47 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 22 minutes 3 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.8133333 latitude, -116.3677778 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually moist, dry for 45 to 60 days in late summer and early fall, xeric soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 6 to 8 degrees C.
Average summer soil temperature: 11 to 13 degrees C.
Carbonates:  60 to 80 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 25 to 36 cm.
Depth to bedrock: 50 to 100 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  12 to 25 percent.
Rock fragments:  60 to 80 percent, mostly gravel, when averaged.  

A horizon
Value:  4 or 5 dry.
Chroma:  2 or 3.

Bw horizon
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4.
Texture: Extremely gravelly loam or extremely gravelly sandy loam.

C horizon
Value:  4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Texture: Extremely gravelly loam or extremely gravelly sandy loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Dekoom and Redmanson series.  

Dekoom soils are very deep and have 40 to 60 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Redmanson soils lack bedrock within 100 cm.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hatur soils are on mountain side slopes. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone or dolostone.  Slopes are l5 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 2,290 to 2,900 meters.  The climate is cool, continental, with cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 660 mm, that comes mostly as snow; mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free season is about 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is Haunchee soils. Haunchee soils have bedrock within 50 cm.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mountain big sagebrush, Idaho fescue and curlleaf mountainmahogany.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.
