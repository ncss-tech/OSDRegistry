USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are cultivated. The principal crops are corn, soybean, small grain, and grass-legume hay. The native vegetation is mixed big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, other grasses of the tall grass prairie and deciduous trees (oak-hickory).

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 20 to 70 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 160 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 20 centimeters (Ap horizon);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 20 to 135 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, Btg1, and Btg2 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

Oxyaquic subgroup based on a zone of saturation within 100 centimeters for 20 or more consecutive days or 30 or more cumulative days in normal years.

Future investigations are needed on map units of Hedrick soils to determine if a paleosol contact is consistently encountered within the series control section.
