HANSFORD SERIES

The Hansford series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey lacustrine sediments of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level soils are on playa floors.  Slope range is 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm (18 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F)

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Epiaquerts

These soils are intermittently moist in September through October and April through June.
