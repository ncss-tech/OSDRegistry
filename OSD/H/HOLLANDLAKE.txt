HOLLANDLAKE SERIES

The Hollandlake series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alpine till. These soils are on till plains, moraines, and mountains in glaciated valleys. Slopes are 4 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Eutric Glossocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Hollandlake gravelly loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; undecomposed and slightly decomposed forest litter.

    E--2 to 6 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderate fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; 20 percent pebbles; moderately acid (pH 5.7); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick)

    E/B--6 to 14 inches; E part (about 75 percent) is light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist that surrounds the B part; B part (about 25 percent) is yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; texture mixed is gravelly loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and medium roots; 25 percent pebbles; moderately acid (pH 5.7); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 12 inches thick)

    Bt/E--14 to 24 inches; B part (75 percent) is yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist with interfingering of E part; E part (25 percent) is light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; texture mixed is very gravelly loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 35 percent pebbles and 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary. (6 to 14 inches thick)

    Bt--24 to 60 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very gravelly clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 35 percent pebbles and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - till plains; moraines; mountains.
Elevation - 4,000 to 5,000 feet.
Slope - 4 to 60 percent.
Parent material - alpine till.
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs.
Mean annual precipitation - 30 to 40 inches, much of which falls as snow and spring rain.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Hollandlake soils are used for timber production, watersheds, and as wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is subalpine fir, western larch, Douglas fir, grand fir, and lodgepole pine with an understory of queencup beadlily, twinflower, blue huckleberry, and common beargrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Hollandlake soils are moderately extensive in western Montana.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Missoula County, Montana, 1985.

REMARKS: Soil interpretation record: MT0429. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 14 inches (E, E/B horizons); an albic horizon from 2 to 6 inches (E horizon); glossic horizons from 6 to 24 inches (E/Bt, Bt/E horizons); an argillic horizon from 14 to 60 inches; a particle-size control section from 14 to 34 inches which is the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon (Bt/E, Bt horizons). Hollandlake soils have a cryic temperature regime and a udic moisture regime. Base saturation (by NH4Oac) is estimated to be 50 percent or more throughout.
