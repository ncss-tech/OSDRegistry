HURDYGURDY SERIES

The Hurdygurdy series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in ash influenced loess over glacial till. Hurdygurdy soils are on mountains. Slopes range from 5 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 50 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 33 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Medial over loamy-skeletal, amorphic over mixed, superactive Andic Humicryods

TYPICAL PEDON: Hurdygurdy - on a slope of 45 percent under shrubs and grasses. (All colors are for moist soil)

	Oe--0 to 5 inches; black (7.5YR 2.5/1); moderately decomposed plant material; very strongly acid (pH 4.5); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 7 inches thick) 

	E--5 to 8 inches; dark gray (7.5YR 4/1) silt loam; weak fine granular structure; friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, common medium, and few coarse roots; strongly acid (pH 5.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 4 inches thick) 

	Bhs--8 to 18 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) silt loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, common medium, and few coarse roots; strongly acid (pH 5.2); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 11 inches thick) 

	2BC--18 to 25 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) very gravelly sandy loam; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine, and few medium roots; 30 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; strongly acid (pH 5.2); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick) 

	2C--25 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly sandy loam; massive; friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; 35 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; strongly acid (pH 5.2).

TYPE LOCATION: Anchorage, Alaska; about 1 1/2 miles southeast of Flattop Mountain, Alaska; in the SW 1/4 of the NW 1/4, section 4, T. 11 N., R. 2 W.; Anchorage A8SE 1:25,000 quad, Seward Meridian; UTM north 6773696 and UTM east 0356709, zone 6.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to glacial till from 15 to 20 inches. Total content of coarse fragments in the upper part of the control section ranges from 0 to 15 percent, 0 to 10 percent gravel, and  0 to 5 percent cobbles. Total content of coarse fragments in the lower part of the control section range from 35 to 60 percent, 30 to 60 percent gravel, and 10 to 45 percent cobbles.

The E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.

The Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.

The 2BC horizon (where present) has value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 4. The Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.

The 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. The texture is sandy loam or loam modified by 40 to 60 percent coarse fragments, 30 to 60 percent gravel, and 10 to 40 percent cobbles. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.

COMPETING SERIES: This is  the Talkeetna series. Talkeetna series are presumed to have a colder soil temperature.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Hurdygurdy soils occur on mountains. Slopes range from 5 to 70 percent. The soils formed in ash influenced loess over glacial till. Mean annual temperature ranges from 25 to 37 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 50 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Siwash soils. Siwash soils are l13 to 26 inches deep to hard bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, medium to very high runoff. Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION: Wildlife habitat and recreation.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South Central Alaska Mountains. The series is of small extent.
