HUMBARSPRINGS SERIES

The Humbarsprings series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Humbarsprings soils are on fans and terraces adjacent to major drainages.  Slopes range from 3 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Humbarsprings gravelly loam - grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 7 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; strongly effervescent; 20 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (7 to 10 inches thick.)

    Bw--7 to 10 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; violently effervescent; 20 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick.)

    Bk1--10 to 22 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; 15.0 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; common fine distinct carbonate masses; violently effervescent; 20 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (10 to 14 inches thick.)

    2Bk2--22 to 35 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; single grain; loose, loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; common medium distinct carbonate masses; violently effervescent throughout; 16 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick.)

    2Bk3--35 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) gravelly loamy fine sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 35.0 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; violently effervescent; 25 percent gravel; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).
