HARPS SERIES

The Harps series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in till or alluvium derived from till.  Harps soils are on narrow rims or shorelines of depressions on till plains and moraines.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 675 millimeters.

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are artificially drained and cultivated. The principal corps are corn, soybeans, small grains, and legume hay.  Reed canarygrass commonly dominates partially drained pasture.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Webster County, Iowa, 1968.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 160 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 41 centimeters (Ap, Ak1 and Ak2 horizons);
calcic horizon--the zone from a depth of 20 to 160 centimeters (Ak1, Ak2, Bkg1, Bkg2, Bkg3, and Bgk4 horizons);
aquic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

A moderately coarse substratum phase is recognized in the southern part of MLRA 103 and a moderately fine substratum phase is recognized in the northern part of MLRA 103.  This difference is based on statistical analysis of lab data throughout the MLRA.
