HUKILL SERIES

The Hukill series consists of deep, well drained soils that
formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from andesite or
andesite tuff.  Hukill soils are on plateaus and have slopes of 1
to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 38 inches
and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, halloysitic, mesic Typic Rhodoxeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hukill gravelly clay loam - on a 1 percent slope
in a forested area at 2,680 feet elevation.  When described, the
soil was dry throughout.  (Colors are for moist soil unless
otherwise stated.)

O--1/2 inch to 0; conifer needles and forest litter, loose
and partially decomposed in lower part.

A--0 to 2 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) gravelly loam,
dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) dry; moderate very fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common medium and coarse roots; many irregular pores; 25 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.
(2 to 4 inches thick)

AB--2 to 6 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) gravelly clay
loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) dry; moderate very fine
subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common medium and coarse roots; many very fine tubular pores; 25 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 8 inches thick)

Bt1--6 to 11 inches; dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) gravelly
clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) dry; moderate very fine and
fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and
plastic; common medium and coarse roots; many very fine tubular pores; few thin clay films; 15 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 12 inches thick)

2Bt2--11 to 20 inches; dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4)
gravelly clay, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) dry; moderate fine
subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic;
common medium and coarse roots; common very fine tubular pores; common thin and few moderately thick clay films; 15 percent
gravel; few black stains; moderately acid (pH 5.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 10 inches thick)

2Bt3--20 to 33 inches; dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4)
gravelly clay, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) dry; moderate fine
subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic;
common medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; common thin
and few moderately thick clay films; 15 percent gravel; common
black stains; moderately acid (pH 5.6); gradual wavy boundary.
(12 to 15 inches thick)

2Bt4--33 to 42 inches; dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4)
gravelly clay, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic;
common medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; common thin
clay films; 25 percent gravel; common black stains; strongly acid
(pH 5.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 15 inches thick)

2Crt--42 inches; Saprolitic andesitic tuff; thin red (2.5YR
4/6) clay films in fractures; common black stains.

TYPE LOCATION:  Jackson County, Oregon; 2 1/2  miles east of
Butte Falls; approximately 50 feet north and 50 feet west of the southeast corner of sec. 1, T. 35 S., R. 2 E., Willamette
Meridian.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 40 to 60 inches.  The
mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 54 degrees F.
These soils are usually moist, but are dry between depths of 4 to
12 inches for 60 to 90 consecutive days or more in the four
months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 10 to 25 percent partially weathered gravel.

The A horizon has hue of 5YR, 2.5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 moist
and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and 3 or 4 dry.

The 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR moist 2.5YR or 5YR dry, value of
3 moist and 4 dry and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry.  It is
gravelly clay, clay, or gravelly clay loam, with 35 to 45 percent clay.  It is strongly or moderately acid.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hukill soils are on plateaus at elevations
of 2,000 to 3,800 feet.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.  The soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from andesite or andesitic tuff.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees
F.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 45 inches.  The
frost-free period is 100 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Freezener and
Geppert soils.  The Geppert soils are loamy-skeletal.  Freezener soils have hue of 5YR and 2.5YR and moist value of 3 or 4 in the argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Timber production, pasture, hay, building
sites, grazing, and recreation.  The native vegetation consists
of Douglas fir, white fir sugar pine, ponderosa pine, Pacific madrone, common snowberry and western fescue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Oregon.  The series is inextensive.
