HOOTER SERIES

The Hooter series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess over alluvium weathered from loess, basalt and volcanic cinders.  They occur on volcanic domes.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  Average annual temperature is about 38 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is about 25 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Cryic Paleborolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hooter silt loam supporting a Douglas fir/ pine grass plant community type, woodland; on a 7 percent south facing slope; about 6,280 feet elevation.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

(4 to 16 inches thick)

     2Bt/E--24 to 30 inches; 80 percent yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) stony silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist Bt material and 20 percent very pale brown (10YR 7/3), brown (10YR 5/3) moist E material; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 5 percent pebbles, 10 percent cobbles, and 15 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 14 inches thick)

     2Bt--30 to 35 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) stony clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; few fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces peds and lining pores; 5 percent pebbles, 10 percent cobbles, and 15 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (4 to 18 inches thick)

    2R--35 inches; hard basalt.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alpon, Ercan, Nopla (T), Pavo, and Pintlar series.  Alpon, Ercan, Nopla, Pavo, and Pintlar soils are more than 40 inches to bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hooter soils are on domes and shields.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 6,000 to 7,000 feet.  The soil formed in local alluvium derived from loess, basalt and andesite.  The average annual precipitation is about 20 to 30 inches.  The average annual air temperature is about 37 to 40 degrees F.  The frost-free season is less than 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Potrmound series.  Potrmound soils are found intermixed with the Hooter soils.  Potrmound soils have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; runoff is slow to medium; permeability is moderately slow.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Hooter soils are used for timber production, recreation, and wildlife habitat.  Principal vegetation is Douglas fir and pinegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern Idaho in the Island Park Caldera. This series is of moderate extent.
