HOCKLEY SERIES

The Hockley series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy sediments derived from the Willis Formation.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils occur on interfluves of the coastal plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5, but are typically less than 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F.), and mean annual precipitation is about 1143 mm (45 in).

Pine trees have encroached on many areas.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle size control section: 58 to 108 cm (23 to 43 in).  (Bt horizon)
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 58 cm (0 to 23 in).  (A1 and A2 horizons) 
Argillic horizon: 58 to 254 cm (23 to 100 in).  (Bt, Btvc1, B't horizons)

Additional Comments: This series recognizes graded phases. The series description was updated during the soil data join and recorrelation initiative in 2014. MLRA 150 Soil Survey office sampled and redescribed the typical pedon during the update of MLRA 150A. The surface texture was changed from a fine sandy loam to a loamy fine sand. 

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data number S00TX-473-1 from Waller County, Texas.  

The mineralogy is supported by laboratory data on sample 72TX-101-3 (72L107).

ADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data from the Texas A&M University Soil Characterization Lab on sample S00TX-473-1 and the National Soil Survey Lab on sample 72TX-101-3 (72L107)
