HAMBURG SERIES

The Hamburg series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils on moderately steep to very steep convex shoulders, backslopes, or ridges on uplands. These soils formed in calcareous loess. Slopes range from 20 to 90 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 81 centimeters (32 inches).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Typic Udorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Hamburg silt loam, on a south-facing slope of 35 percent, in a native pasture.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 A--0 to 10 centimeters (0 to 4 inches); dark brown (10YR 3/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; weak fine and very fine granular structure; very friable; many fine and very fine roots; common worm casts; slightly effervescent; neutral; clear smooth boundary. [0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches) thick]

 AC--10 to 36 centimeters (4 to 14 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam; weak very fine granular structure; very friable; many fine and very fine roots; common worm casts; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline; diffuse smooth boundary. [0 to 51 centimeters (0 to 20 inches) thick]

 C1--36 to 63 centimeters (14 to 25 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam; massive with some vertical cracks; very friable; common fine and very fine roots; few worm casts; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline; diffuse smooth boundary. [10 to 51 centimeters (4 to 20 inches) thick]

 C2--63 to 152 centimeters (25 to 60 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam; massive with some vertical cracks; very friable; few fine roots few worm casts; few small calcium carbonate concretions; few fine faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) and few fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations and few fine faint light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) redoximorphic depletions; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Holt County, Missouri; 4 miles south of Mound City; about 1,200 feet south and 750 feet west of the northeast corner of sec. 30, T. 61 N., R. 38 W; Kimsey Creek topographic quadrangle; lat. 40.070085 degrees and long. -95.222944 degrees; WGS84.

C horizon:
Hue--10YR
Value--4 to 6
Chroma--2 to 4
Texture--silt loam, silt, or very fine sandy loam
Clay content--6 to 12 percent
Sand content: 10 to 50 percent, mostly very fine sand

Redoximorphic features--depletions or concentrations below a depth of 51 centimeters (20 inches) are believed to be relict features

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bold, Mula, and Netawaka series.
Bold--have a total sand content of less than 10 percent in the particle-size control section
Mula--have a clay content of 12 and 18 percent in the particle-size control section and have a calcic horizon
Netawaka--have a clay content of 12 and 18 percent in the series control section

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material--calcareous loess
Landform--moderately steep to very steep convex shoulders, backslopes, or ridges on uplands
Slopes--20 to 90 percent
Mean annual air temperature--7 to 13 degrees C (45 to 55 degrees F).
Mean annual precipitation--61 to 102 centimeters (24 to 40 inches)
Elevation--1,100 to 1,500 feet above sea level
Frost-free period--145 to 175 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Castana, Ida, Knox, and Napier soils.
Castana--are at the lower elevations and have a mollic epipedon 25 to 61 centimeters (10 to 24 inches) thick
Ida--are in similar landscape positions to those of the Hamburg soils and have a clay content of 18 to 25 percent in the particle-size control section
Knox--are in similar landscape positions to those of the Hamburg soils and have a clay content of 25 to 35 percent in the particle-size control section
Napier--are at the lower elevations on footslopes and alluvial fans and have a mollic epipedon 61 to 102 centimeters (24 to 40 inches) thick

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--somewhat excessively drained--a saturated zone does not occur within a depth of 6 feet during the wettest periods of most years
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--1.00 to 10.00 micrometers per second
Surface runoff potential--medium or high

USE AND VEGETATION:
Almost all areas are used for pasture or wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is little bluestem, big bluestem, indiangrass, switchgrass, and other grasses of the short and tall grass prairie and thin stands of white oak, bur oak and eastern redcedar.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
LRR M, MLRAs 107, 115; northwestern Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, and Kansas. The series is of moderate extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Atchison County, Missouri, 1909.

REMARKS:
Particle size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 102 centimeters (10 to 40 inches) (AC, C1, and C2 horizons)

These soils typically have distinct natural terracettes that apparently formed as a result of soil slump.
