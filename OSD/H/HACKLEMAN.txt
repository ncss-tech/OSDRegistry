HACKLEMAN SERIES

The Hackleman Series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over residuum and colluvium derived from welded tuff or basalt.  Hackleman soils are on hills, and lava plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is 7 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Dester, Littlegrass, and Whiskeyrun series. 
Dester soils contain very coarse ashy sandy loam and coarse ashy sandy loams textures with paragravel pumice fragments in the volcanic ash influenced layers. Littlegrass and Whiskeyrun soils are greater than 100 cm to lithic contact. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hackleman soils are on hills,  and lava plateaus. This soil formed in volcanic ash over residuum and colluvium derived from welded tuff or basalt. Slopes are 0 to 35 percent. Elevations range from 1,150 to 1,300 m (3,800 to 4,300 ft). Mean annual precipitation is 250 mm to 330 mm (10 to 13 in), and the mean annual temperature is 5 to 8 degrees C (41 to 47 F) . The frost free period is 50 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Carryback, Connleyhills, Embal, Goodtack, Ninemile series. Carryback soils average greater than 35 percent clay in the control section and occur on plateaus. Connleyhills soils are clayey-skeletal and occur on hillslopes and plateaus. Embal soils occur on swales and are greater than 150cm to bedrock. Goodtack soils are shallow to duripan. Ninemile soils are shallow to lithic contact.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Hackleman soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, Thurber's needlegrass, Sandberg bluegrass, basin big sagebrush, and Wyoming big sagebrush. The typical ecological site is Droughty Loam 11-13 PZ (R023XY316OR).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Oregon, MLRA D-23. These soils are not extensive. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon.

Argillic horizon:  26 to 61 cm (2Bt and 2Btk horizons)
Particle-size control section:  26 to 61 cm (2Bt and 2Btk horizons) 
Lithic contact: 61 cm 
Vitritorrandic feature: 0 to 26 cm (A and AB horizons) has 5 to 20 percent glass and ammonium oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the iron is 0.2 to 0.4 percent.

02/2015: The Hackleman soil was created to describe the ash influenced surface layers not recognized by the Reluctan soil mapped in the same area. Further investigation may be needed to determine if Reluctan soils have ash influenced surface layers that have not been described.
The coordinates were recorded with a GPS unit and the PLSS details were measured in ArcGIS from the coordinates.
