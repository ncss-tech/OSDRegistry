HALLSUMMIT SERIES

The Hallsummit series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in thick loamy and clayey sediments on Tertiary-aged Coastal Plains. These soils are on broad sloping interfluves. Slope is dominantly 1 to 8 but ranges up to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1,318 mm (52 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C (65 degrees F).

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Red River Parish, Louisiana; 1973. The Hallsummit name is derived from a small community in Red River Parish, Louisiana.

REMARKS: The Hallsummit series was updated in 2002 to specify that it must have a clay tuck within a depth of 152 cm (60 in) and cannot have geologic C materials within a depth of 152 cm (60 in). The Hallsummit series was renamed in 2021. Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 in) (A and E horizons)
Argillic horizon: 18 to 185 cm (7 to 73 in) (Bt horizons)
