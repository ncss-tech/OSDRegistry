HARTWICK SERIES

The Hartwick series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in sandy and gravelly glaciofluvial deposits on outwash plains and ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, frigid Entic Haplorthods

TYPICAL PEDON: Hartwick sand, on a 1 percent slope in a forested area beneath a 2.5 cm (1 inch) layer of fresh, undecomposed needles, twigs, and grass, at an elevation of about 381 meters (1250 feet). (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 A--0 to 5 cm (2 inches); black (N 2.5/) sand, black (10YR 2/1) dry; mixed with 20 percent brown (7.5YR 5/2) uncoated sand grains; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; many fine, common medium, and few coarse roots; about 3 percent fine gravel; very strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [2.5 to 10 cm (1 to 4 inches) thick]

 E--5 to 10 cm (2 to 4 inches); brown (7.5YR 5/2) sand, pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) dry; very weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; very friable; many fine, common medium, and few coarse roots; about 3 percent fine gravel; strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. [2.5 to 13 cm (1 to 5 inches) thick]

 Bs1--10 to 20 cm (4 to 8 inches); dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) sand; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; many fine, common medium, and few coarse roots; about 8 percent fine and 2 percent medium gravel and 1 percent cobbles; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. [10 to 20 cm (4 to 8 inches) thick]

 Bs2--20 to 61 cm (8 to 24 inches); strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) very gravelly sand; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; very friable; common fine and few medium and coarse roots; columns of yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) (70 percent) and dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) (30 percent) moderately cemented ortstein 2.5 to 8 cm (1 to 3 inches) wide extend through this horizon; columns are 61 to 91 cm (24 to 36 inches) apart; ortstein occupies about 5 percent of the horizon; about 20 percent fine, 10 percent medium, and 5 percent coarse gravel and 1 percent cobbles; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. [20 to 51 cm (8 to 20 inches) thick]

 BC--61 to 76 cm (24 to 30 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) sand; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure parting to single grain; very friable to loose; few fine to coarse roots; about 5 percent fine and 2 percent medium gravel; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. [0 to 25 cm (10 inches) thick]

 C1--76 to 99 cm (30 to 39 inches); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly sand; single grain; loose; few fine and medium roots; about 35 percent fine, 10 percent medium, and 5 percent coarse gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary. [10 to 30 cm (4 to 12 inches) thick]

 C2--99 to 203 cm (39 to 80 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) and light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sand; single grain; loose; about 5 percent fine and 2 percent medium gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Crawford County, Michigan; 600 feet east and 550 feet south of the northwest corner of sec. 3, T. 27 N., R. 3 W.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Duel, East Lake, Ishpeming, Karlin, Kiva, Rousseau, Rubicon, Sayner, and Sultz series. Duel and Ishpeming soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). East Lake soils have more than 25 percent gravel below a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Karlin, Rubicon, Sayner, and Sultz soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Kiva soils contain more than 10 percent clay in the upper part of the series control section. Rousseau soils average less than 10 percent gravel in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hartwick soils are in paleo drainage channels on ground moraines and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 813 mm (27 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 5.6 to 7.2 degrees C (42 to 45 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the well drained to excessively drained Blue Lake, Kalkaska, and Rubicon soils. They occur on similar or slightly higher landscape positions. The moderately well drained Croswell soils occur on lower landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Excessively drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high. Permeability is rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of this soil are forested. Pine plantations make up a small portion of this area. Common tree species include quaking aspen, red maple, eastern white pine, red pine, northern red oak, and sugar maple.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 94A in northern Lower Michigan. The series is of small extent.
