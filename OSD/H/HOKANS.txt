HOKANS SERIES

The Hokans series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till of the Late Wisconsin glaciation.  These soils are on nearly level to gently undulating moraines on till plains.  Slope ranges from 1 to 6 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C (41 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 665 millimeters (26 inches). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Hapludolls

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Swift County, Minnesota. 2000. 

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 150 centimeters

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 38 centimeters (0 to 15 inches) (Ap and A horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 38 to 56 centimeters (15 to 22 inches) (Bw horizon);
calcic horizon--the zone from a depth of 56 to 102 centimeters (22 to 40 inches) (Bk horizon);

These soils were formerly included with the Barnes soils. In the eastern part of MLRA 102A soil saturation frequently occurs at depths of 1 to 1.5 meters in normal years.
