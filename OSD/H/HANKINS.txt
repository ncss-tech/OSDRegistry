SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Trout Creek-Shaniko Area, Oregon; 1970.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are
Particle size control section--25 to 75 cm (2AB, 2Bt1, and part of the 2Bt2 horizon)
Mollic epipedon--3 to 104 cm (A1, A2, 2AB, 2Bt1, and 2Bt2 horizons)
Volcanic glass--3 to 25 cm (A1 and A2 horizons)
Argillic horizon--25 to 117 cm (2BA, 2Bt1, 2Bt2, and 2BC horizons)
Pale feature--abrupt textural change to 25cm with an absolute increase in clay content of 20 percent
Vertic subgroup--the calculated LE is over 6.0 centimeters within the upper 100 cm
Lithologic Discontinuity--25 cm
Paralithic contact--117 cm

In 2017, the type location was moved from Grant County back to the original 1970 type location within the Trout Creek-Shaniko soil survey area. This was done to preserve the original concept of coarse ash textures in the surface horizons.
