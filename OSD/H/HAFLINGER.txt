HAFLINGER SERIES

The Haflinger series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in cobbly coarse textured alluvium of volcanic origin.  These soils are on low terraces and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 70 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Entic Humudepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Haflinger cobbly loam - cutover timberland.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 8 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) cobbly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; moderate very fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; 20 percent cobbles and 10 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)

    A2--8 to 17 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) cobbly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic, common fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; 10 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.8); gradual smooth boundary.  (7 to 13 inches thick)

    C1--17 to 24 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) very cobbly loamy sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; single grained; loose; nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 20 percent gravel and 30 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6); abrupt wavy boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

    C2--24 to 60 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) extremely cobbly sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; single grained; loose; nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; 5 percent gravel and 50 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6).

TYPE LOCATION: Lane County, Oregon; about 50 miles east of Eugene in the McKenzie River valley, near the multiple use sign south of Buchart Bridge on the road to Cougar Reservoir; southwest 1/4 northwest 1/4 of sec. 19, T. 16 S., R. 5 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is usually moist, but is dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches for less than 45 consecutive days during the summer.  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The particle-size control section dominantly is loamy sand or sand with 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  It is cobbly loam or cobbly sandy loam and averages 10 to 20 percent gravel and 15 to 30 percent cobbles.

The C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is very cobbly loamy sand, sand, or extremely cobbly sand, and averages 35 to 60 percent cobbles and 15 to 35 percent gravel.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bonneville, Gearhart, and Smith Creek series in other families.  Bonneville and Smith Creek soils have a xeric moisture regime.  Gearhart soils have an isomesic soil temperature regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Haflinger soils are on river terraces and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  They are at elevations of 900 to 1,500 feet.  The soils formed in coarse textured alluvium and outwash dominantly from basic igeneous origin with some volcanic ash.  The climate is humid with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 65 to 75 inches.  The mean January temperature is 34 degrees F; mean July temperature is 64 degrees F; and mean annual temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 130 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cupola, Jimbo, and Saturn soils.  Cupola soils are medial-skeletal.  Jimbo soils are coarse-loamy and lack rock fragments above a depth of 40 inches.  Saturn soils are fine-loamy over fragmental.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Excessively drained; slow runoff; moderately rapid over rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Homesites, recreation, and timber production.  Native vegetation is mainly Douglas-fir, western hemlock, incense-cedar, salal, western swordfern, red huckleberry, Pacific rhododendron, vine maple, and numerous small plants.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Upper drainage basins of the McKenzie River in the western Cascade Mountains; MLRA 3.  The series is not extensive.
