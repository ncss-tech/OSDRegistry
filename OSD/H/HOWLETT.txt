HOWLETT SERIES

The Howlett series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from sandstone.  Howlett soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 5 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Howlett cobbly sandy loam, on a north facing, convex, 22 percent slope in mixed conifers at an elevation of 9,350 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on July 15, 1983 the soil was moist from 0 to 65 inches.  The surface is covered by 1 percent stones.

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; slightly decomposed plant material. 

    E--2 to 14 inches; pinkish gray (5YR 6/2) cobbly sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine, medium and coarse roots; 10 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, 1 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.  (9 to 20 inches thick)

    Bt1--14 to 23 inches; weak red (2.5YR 5/2) gravelly sandy clay loam, weak red (2.5YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine to coarse roots; common continuous clay films on faces of peds; 15 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.1); clear smooth boundary.  

    Bt2--23 to 47 inches; reddish brown (2.5YR 5/3) gravelly sandy clay loam, reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; many continuous clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; slightly acid pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt1 and Bt2 horizons is 28 to 40 inches thick)

    BCt--47 to 65 inches; reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) very cobbly sandy clay loam, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; few continuous clay films on faces of peds; 15 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles; neutral pH 6.6).
