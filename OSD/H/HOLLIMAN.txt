HOLLIMAN SERIES

The Holliman series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granitoid. The Holliman soils are on alluvial fans and inset fans. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 210 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 14 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, nonacid, thermic Ustic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Holliman sand, on a southwest facing, 8 percent slope under rangeland at an elevation of 1537 meters. (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted. 4/6/2016 actual site observation date.) 

     A--0 to 9 cm (0 to 4 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 90 percent sand; 7 percent silt; 3 percent clay; common very fine roots throughout; many very fine irregular pores; 7 percent fine gravel, 6 percent medium and coarse gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (4 to 15 cm, 2 to 6 inches thick) 

     C1--9 to 30 cm (4 to 12 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) loamy sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 78 percent sand; 15 percent silt; 7 percent clay; few fine roots throughout and few very fine roots throughout; common very fine irregular pores; 7 percent fine gravel, 7 percent medium and coarse gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 25 cm, 0 to 10 inches thick)

     C2--30 to 100 cm (12 to 39 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 70 percent sand; 22 percent silt; 8 percent clay; few fine roots throughout and few medium roots throughout and common very fine roots throughout; common very fine irregular and common very fine tubular pores; 5 percent fine gravel, 5 percent medium and coarse gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary.

     C3--100 to 155 cm (39 to 61 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 70 percent sand; 22 percent silt; 8 percent clay; few very fine roots throughout; common very fine irregular pores; 5 percent fine gravel, 5 percent medium and coarse gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6). (Combined thickness of the C2 and C3 horizons is 80 to 140 cm, 32 to 55 inches.)

TYPE LOCATION: San Bernardino County, California; about 5 miles east and 4 miles south of Cima; about 1,190 feet west and 1,800 feet north of the southeast corner of section 30, T. 13 N., R. 15 E., San Bernardino Baseline and Meridian; USGS Mid Hills, California 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; 35 degrees, 10 minutes, 34.90 seconds north latitude and 115 degrees, 24 minutes, 23.00 seconds west longitude; UTM zone 11 645112e, 3893764n, NAD83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: usually dry, moist in some part from December to March and intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days during July to September following summer convection storms; aridic moisture regime that borders on ustic.

Soil temperature: 15 to 18 degrees C (59 to 64 degrees F). 
Surface rock fragments: 20 to 65 percent, dominantly gravel. 

Control section
Rock fragments: 5 to 25 percent, dominantly gravel.
Clay content: averages 6 to 10 percent, ranges from 3 to 12.
Texture of the fine earth fraction: averages sandy loam. 

A horizon
Value: 4 or 5 dry. 
Chroma: 2 or 3 moist.
Clay content: 2 to 6 percent.
Rock fragments: 5 to 15 percent.
Reaction: neutral to slightly alkaline.

C horizons
Value: 4 or 5 dry.
Chroma: 3 or 4 dry or moist.
Texture of the fine earth fraction: sandy loam and loamy sand.
Clay content: 3 to 12 percent.
Rock fragments: 5 to 25 percent, in the control section. 
Structure: weak or medium, subangular blocky or massive. 
Consistence: soft to moderately hard.
Note: Some pedons have very gravelly or extremely gravelly sand or coarse sand horizon in the lower profile. 

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Holliman soils are on alluvial fans and inset fans. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. The soils formed in alluvium derived from granitoid. Elevation ranges from 1300 to 1700 meters (~4260 to 5580 feet). The mean annual precipitation is 175 to 225 mm (~7 to 9 in.). The mean annual air temperature is about 13 to 16 degrees C (~55 to 61 degrees F). The frost-free period is 210 to 270 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cedarwash (T) and Rocksalad (T) soils. Cedarwash soils are on fan remnants and have an argillic horizon. Rocksalad soils are in drainageways and fan aprons, and have a sandy-skeletal particle size control section. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very low runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Holliman soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is Cooper's wolfberry, purple sage, desert peach and basin big sagebrush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southeastern California; MLRA 30. These soils are of small extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California.

SERIES PROPOSED: San Bernardino County, California, Soil Survey of Mojave National Preserve Area, California, 2019. The name is coined from Holliman Spring located to the south in Round Valley. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 18 cm (A and part of the C1 horizons)
Particle size control section - the zone from 25 to 100 cm (Part of the C1 and C2 horizons)
