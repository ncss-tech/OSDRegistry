HENRIETTA SERIES

The Henrietta series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in organic materials less than 41 cm (16 inches) thick and the underlying loamy and sandy sediments. They are on glacial drainageways, lake plains, outwash plains, and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, nonacid, mesic Histic Humaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Henrietta muck, on a nearly level slope in a cultivated field at an elevation of 277 meters (908 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Oap--0 to 30 cm (12 inches); black (N 2.5/) broken face and rubbed muck; 3 percent fiber; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; common fine roots; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [20 to 38 cm (8 to 15 inches) thick]

 Bg1--30 to 46 cm (12 to 18 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loamy fine sand; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; common fine roots; black (N 2.5/) muck in large 3 to 6 mm (1/8 to 1/4 inch) root channels; common fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; 3 percent gravel; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. [0 to 20 cm (8 inches) thick]

 Bg2--46 to 84 cm (18 to 33 inches); stratified gray (10YR 6/1) silt loam and fine sandy loam and light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sand; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable (silt loam and fine sandy loam part); single grain; loose (fine sand part); few fine roots; black (N 2.5/) muck in root channels 3 to 6 mm (1/8 to 1/4 inch diameter); 3 percent gravel; neutral; gradual wavy boundary. [25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 inches) thick]

 Bg3--84 to 109 cm (33 to 43 inches); gray (10YR 6/1) stratified silt loam and fine sandy loam; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; black (N 2.5/) muck in root channels 3 to 6 mm (1/8 to 1/4 inch diameter); many medium prominent light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) masses of oxidized iron; 3 percent gravel; slightly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. [0 to 30 cm (12 inches) thick]

 Cg--109 to 152 cm (43 to 60 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loamy fine sand; massive; very friable; thin lenses of silt loam and fine sandy loam; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Jackson County, Michigan; about 3 1/2 miles southwest of Munith; 1,800 feet south and 750 feet east of the northwest corner of sec. 26, T. 1 S., R. 1 E.; USGS Gilletts Lake topographic quadrangle; lat. 42 degrees 21 minutes 34.2 seconds N. and long. 84 degrees 17 minutes 17.3 seconds W., NAD 27; UTM Zone 16, 723332 easting and 4693258 northing, NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Thickness of the solum: 51 to 127 cm (20 to 50 inches)
Particle-size control section: averages 5 to 18 percent clay and 35 to 55 percent fine sand or coarser

Oap horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR, or is neutral
Value: 2, 2.5, or 3
Chroma: 0 to 3
Structure: weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky; some pedons are massive
Mineral content: up to 60 percent by volume
Fiber content: less than 15 percent when rubbed
Reaction: moderately acid to slightly alkaline

Bg horizon:
Hue: 10YR to 5Y
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: dominantly silt loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam with strata of sandy clay loam, loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or sand
Structure: weak or moderate subangular blocky
Rock fragment content: 0 to 14 percent
Reaction: moderately acid to slightly alkaline

Cg horizon:
Hue: 10YR to 5Y
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: stratified silt loam, loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or sand
Rock fragment content: 0 to 14 percent
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline; most pedons contain carbonates 

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. Haug, Linwood, Martisco, Palms, Thomas, and Twig series are in related families. Haug and Twig soils have a frigid temperature regime. Martisco soils are carbonatic. Linwood and Palms soils have organic layers that are thicker than 41 cm (16 inches). Thomas soils contain more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Henrietta soils are on glacial drainageways, lake plains, outwash plains, and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Henrietta soils formed in organic materials less than 41 cm (16 inches) thick and the underlying loamy and sandy sediments. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 1067 mm (27 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.2 to 12.8 degrees C (45 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 198 days. Elevation is 174 to 466 meters (570 to 1,530 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Henrietta soils are associated with the Dixboro, Edwards, Gilford, Houghton, Lamson, and Palms soils. Dixboro, Gilford, and Lamson soils are on higher elevations and lack the histic epipedon that is present in the Henrietta soils. Edwards, Houghton, and Palms soils are on the same landform position and have thicker histic layers than the Henrietta soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of these soils are used for cropland. Some small areas are used for pasture and woodland.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 98, 101, 111B, 111C, and 140 in southern part of lower Michigan, northern Indiana, and New York. The series is of small extent.
