HOOVERS SERIES

The Hoovers series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in loamy slope alluvium derived from sandstone and shale over loamy residuum derived from  sandstone.  Hoovers soils are on dipslopes on cuestas and summits on mesas.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Lithic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hoovers very flaggy loam, 4 percent slope at an elevation of 5,645 feet in rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

	A--0 to 6 inches (0 to 15 cm); brown (7.5YR 5/4) very flaggy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent, strongly effervescent; 20 percent channers, 30 percent flagstones; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick)

	Bk1--6 to 14 inches (15 to 36 cm); pale brown (10YR 6/3) very flaggy clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; very few very fine roots; 5 percent calcium carbonate segregated as seams and pendants on rock fragments, 20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent, violently effervescent; 25 percent channers, 30 percent flagstones; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. 

	Bk2--14 to 18 inches (36 to 46 cm); light gray (10YR 7/2) very flaggy clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 8 percent calcium carbonate segregated as seams and pendants on rock fragments, 20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent, violently effervescent; 20 percent channers, 25 percent flagstones; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt wavy boundary.  (Total thickness of the Bk horizons is 6 to 18 inches.)

	R--18 inches (46 cm); unweathered sandstone bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Montrose County, Colorado; about 650 feet east and 1,700 feet south of the northwest corner of section 16, T. 50 N., R. 11 W.  Latitude 38 degrees, 36 minutes 6 seconds N, longitude 108 degrees, 6 minutes 43 seconds W. NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture:  The soil moisture control section is affected by precipitation that is evenly distributed throughout the year, with the exception of a slight increase in the spring and a significant increase in late summer; typic aridic moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature:  51 to 53 degrees F
Depth to lithic contact:  10 to 20 inches to sandstone
Depth to secondary calcium carbonate:  4 to 6 inches
Depth to calcic horizon:  4 to 6 inches

Particle-size control section (weighted average):  
  Clay content:  20 to 34 percent
  Rock fragments:  35 to 60 percent sandstone channers and flagstones


A horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR
Value:  4 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist
Chroma:  3 to 6, dry or moist
Clay content:  15 to 26 percent
Rock fragments:  15 to 35 percent sandstone channers; 5 to 30 percent sandstone flagstones
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  0 to 10 percent
Reaction:  moderately alkaline

Bk horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR to 2.5Y
Value:  6 to 8 dry, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma:  1 to 4 dry or moist
Texture:  very flaggy clay loam, very channery loam
Clay content:  23 to 34 percent
Rock fragments:  20 to 50 percent sandstone channers; 5 to 30 percent sandstone flagstones
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  18 to 25 percent
Gypsum content: 0 to 4 percent (mostly just above bedrock contact)
Reaction:  moderately to strongly alkaline

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Crotoncanyon and Rochpah  series.  The Crotoncanyon and Rochpah series have mean annual soil temperatures greater than 53 degrees F

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  loamy slope alluvium derived from sandstone and shale over loamy residuum derived from sandstone
Landform:  dipslopes on cuestas and summits on mesas
Slopes:  1 to 15 percent
Elevation:  5,000 to 5,700 feet
Mean annual temperature:  49 to 51 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation:  10 to 12 inches
Relative effective annual precipitation:  8 to 10 inches
Precipitation pattern:  The soil moisture control section is affected by precipitation that is evenly distributed throughout the year, with the exception of a slight increase in the spring and a significant increase in late summer.
Freeze-free period:  140 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Roatcap series.  Roatcap soils have bedrock between 20 and 40 inches and have a gypsic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderate to moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally for livestock grazing.  Native vegetation consists of galleta, saline wildrye, Indian ricegrass, and shadscale.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern edge of the Uncompahgre Plateau in Western Colorado; LRR D, MLRA 36; minor extent.

SERIES PROPOSED:  Montrose County, Colorado, 1986, Ridgway Soil Survey Area. The name is taken from a nearby community and quad sheet name.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 18 inches (25 to 46 cm).  (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 6 inches (0 to 15 cm).  (A horizon)
Calcic horizon:  The zone from 6 to 18 inches (15 to 46 cm).  (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)
Lithic contact:  The contact with sandstone at 18 inches (46 cm).  (R layer)

The classification was changed from Lithic Ustic Haplocalcids to Lithic Haplocalcids April 2004 because the vegetation indicated a drier regime than what was predicted from the precipitation in the area.  The soil moisture regime is now considered to be typic aridic.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
