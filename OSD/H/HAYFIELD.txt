HAYFIELD SERIES

The Hayfield series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of silty or loamy sediments and the underlying sandy and gravelly outwash.  These soils are on linear or concave slopes on outwash plains, valley trains, treads and risers on stream terraces, and glaciated uplands.  Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquollic Hapludalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON: Hayfield loam, on a linear slope of less than 1 percent, in a cultivated field, at an elevation of about 360 meters above sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.) 

 Ap--0 to 20 centimeters; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; friable; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (15 to 23 centimeters thick) 

 E--20 to 33 centimeters; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak medium platy structure; friable; common fine pores; common patchy and continuous thin very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) organic stains on peds; few fine distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) masses of iron accumulation; moderately acid; abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 15 centimeters thick) 

 Bt1--33 to 61 centimeters; brown (10YR 4/3) loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine pores; thin and medium patchy grayish brown (10YR 5/2) coats on peds; few faint clay films in pores; few fine faint light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) masses of iron accumulation; few fine faint grayish brown (10YR 5/2) masses of iron depletion; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. 

 Bt2--61 to 74 centimeters; brown (10YR 4/3) loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine pores; common clay bridges between sand grains, few faint clay films on faces of peds and in pores; many fine faint grayish brown (10YR 5/2) masses of iron depletion; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 25 to 76 centimeters.) 

 2C--74 to 203 centimeters; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) coarse sand; single grain; loose; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation; common medium distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) masses of iron depletion; about 5 percent rock fragments; slightly acid.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 33 to 100 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, and 2C horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (Ap, E, Bt1, Bt2, and 2C horizons). 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 33 centimeters (Ap and E horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 33 to 74 centimeters (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons);
abrupt textural change--at the upper boundary of the 2C horizon;
udic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
