HUNGRY SERIES

The Hungry series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from serpentinitic rocks.  Hungry soils are on mountain side slopes and have slopes of 35 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 1880 mm (74 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 11 C. (52 degrees F.). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, magnesic, frigid Typic Haploxerepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hungry very gravelly clay loam on an east facing slope of 60 percent under conifers at an elevation of 1,390 m. (4,560 feet). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.  When described on 10/27/77 the soil was dry throughout the upper 84 cm and moist below. 

    Oi--0 to 4 cm; fresh and decomposing needle litter; abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 6 cm thick) 

    A1--4 to 22 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very gravelly clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine, common fine, and few medium roots throughout; many very fine interstitial pores; 50 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.7); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 25 cm thick) 

    Bw1--22 to 39 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very gravelly clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots throughout; many very fine interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear wavy boundary. (13 to 30 cm thick) 

    Bw2--39 to 80 cm; pink (5YR 7/4) extremely cobbly clay loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium and coarse roots throughout; many very fine interstitial pores; 20 percent gravel and 50 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.7); clear wavy boundary. (30 to 64 cm thick) 

    C--80 to 138 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) very cobbly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and medium roots throughout; many very fine interstitial pores; 15 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.3); abrupt wavy boundary. (25 to 51 cm thick) 

    R--138 cm; slightly weathered serpentinite. 

TYPE LOCATION:  Humboldt County, California; near Friday Camp in road cut on Titlow Hill Road about 1.5 kilometers (2.4 miles)from Friday Ridge Road junction; USGS Grouse Mountain Quadrangle; UTM zone 10 441044mE, 4521102mN; NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture: The soil moisture control section (20 and 61 centimeters) is dry in all parts from mid-June to mid-October and moist in all parts from November to April. The soils have a xeric soil moisture regime.

Soil Temperature:  The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to be 6 to 8 degrees C. Mean summer soil temperature is estimated to be 9 to 10 degrees C. The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures is estimated to be 6 degrees C or more. The soils have a frigid soil temperature regime.

Base Saturation: by Hach Kit is 60 to 65 percent at 31 cm.  

Soil Reaction:  Slightly or moderately acid throughout and the Ca/Mg ratio is less than 2.

Depth to a lithic contact: 100 to 150 centimeters.

Particle Size Control Section (weighted average):

Clay: ranges 28 to 35 percent.
Rock fragments: 35 to 65 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Parks series. Parks soils are 100 to 150 centimeters to a paralithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hungry soils are on mountain side slopes.  Slopes are 35 to 70 percent.  The soils formed in material weathered from serpentinite.  Elevations are 1,219 to 1,830 meters. (4500 to 6000 feet)  The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cool wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation varies from 1,750 to 2,030 millimeters (70 to 80 inches). Mean January temperature is 6 degrees C (43 degrees F); mean July temperature is 17 degrees C (63 degrees C), and mean annual temperature is 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).  Frost-free season is estimated to be about 75 to 150 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Laketwin and Madbutte.  Both of these soils are found nearby but are derived from schist.  

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity, moderately slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for watershed, wildlife habitat, and timber production.  Native vegetation is sugar pine, Jeffery pine, incense cedar, beargrass, huckleberry oak, with a few Douglas-fir. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Siskiyou-Trinity Area, MLRA 5. The soils are not extensive.
