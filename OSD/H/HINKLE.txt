HINKLE SERIES

The Hinkle series consists of very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey material weathered from old alluvium of granitic outwash. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on broad summits and shoulder slopes of terrace sediments in the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78C) and the Wichita Mountains (MLRA 82B). Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 660 mm (26 in).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the closely competing Foard series and the Hollister, Lawton, and Tillman series. 
Foard soils: are on the same positions, but have lower sodium content 
Hollister, Lawton, and Tillman soils: have mollic epipedons and do not have natric horizons 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage class: well drained 
Permeability: very slow
Runoff: negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes, high on 1 to 3 percent slopes

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used for small grains. Some areas are used for cotton, grain sorghum, tame pasture or rangeland. Native vegetation is mid grasses. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Oklahoma. LRR-H; Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78C) and the Wichita Mountains (MLRA 82B). The series is moderately extensive. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Canadian County, Oklahoma; 1972. 

REMARKS: 
Hinkle soils were formerly correlated as slick spots in recent soil surveys.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 in) (A horizon)
Natric horizon: 15 to 150 cm (6 to 60 in) (Bt horizon)
Vertic feature: this soil has cracks within 125 cm (49 in) of the mineral soil surface that are 5 mm or more wide through a thickness of 30 cm (12 in) or more for some time in most years, and slickensides in a layer 15 cm (6 in) or more thick that has its upper boundary within 125 cm (49 in) of the mineral soil surface; or a linear extensibility of 6.0 or more between the mineral soil surface and a depth of 100 cm (40 in).
