HEGLAR SERIES

The Heglar series consists of very deep, well-drained, moderately
permeable soils that formed in silty alluvium and loess. They are on 
fan terraces and hillslopes and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent. The 
average annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the average annual temperature is about 7.8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Calcixerepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Heglar silt loam - range - on an 11 percent simple slope, west aspect, 1,510 meter elevation. (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise stated. When described on Sept. 27, 1982, the soil was dry below 5 inches.)

    A--0 to 13 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR3/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and medium, few fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 15 cm thick)

    Bw1--13 to 25 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak very coarse prismatic structure parting to weak very coarse subangular blocky; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; many very fine and few fine tubular pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)

    Bw2--25 to 33 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; 5 percent firm and very firm when moist nodules; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 8 cm thick)

    Bk1--33 to 43 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; moderate thick and very thick platy structure; hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent (29 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 33 cm thick)

   Bk2--43 to 69 cm; light gray (10YR 7/3) silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent (30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); 25 percent friable when moist nodules; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); gradual smooth boundary.  (15 to 43 cm thick)

    Bk3--69 to 91 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent (23 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); 20 percent hard, friable when moist nodules; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); gradual smooth boundary.  (18 to 38 cm thick)

    Bk4--91 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; moderately effervescent (20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); violently effervescent carbonate segregated in few fine irregularly shaped seams and filaments; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0).

TYPE LOCATION: Cassia County, Idaho, about 3 miles east of Albion, Idaho; about 200 feet east and 450 feet north of the southwest corner of sec. 35, T. 11 S., R. 25 E.; USGS Albion 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 42 degrees 25 minutes 01 seconds N and longitude 113 degrees 30 minutes 38 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 42.4169444 latitude, -113.5105556 longitude.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Hillfield series. Hillfield soils formed in lacustrine sediments. They have stratified C horizons with textures ranging from fine sand to silty clay loam. They have laminated sediments and lack hard nodules.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Heglar soils are on fan terraces and hillslopes. Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent. Elevation ranges from 4,400 to 5,600 feet. The soil formed in loess and silty alluvium. The average annual precipitation is about 300 to 410 mm, the average annual air temperature is about 7.2 to 8.9 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 100 to 125 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bahem, Declo, Rexburg, and Watercanyon soils. Bahem and Declo soils are calcareous throughout and have an aridic moisture regime. Rexburg soils have a mollic epipedon and are frigid. Watercanyon soils are frigid. Bahem and Declo soils are on fan terraces. Rexburg and Watercanyon soils are on uplands and mountain sides above Heglar or have northerly aspects.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow to rapid runoff; moderate saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Heglar soils are used for range and dryland crops. The natural vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  This series is moderately extensive in southern Idaho. MLRA 13 and 25.
