HARRIS SERIES

The Harris series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils. These soils formed in saline clay derived from Halocene age coastal sediments. Slope is less than 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (70 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1270 mm (50 in).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Aransas and Franeau series. Similar soils are the Agee, Barbary, Caplen, Surfside, Tracosa, and Velasco series. 

Aransas soils have high runoff. 

Franeau soils are on higher landscape. 

Agee soils are nonsaline in all horizons. 

Barbary soils have very-fine particle-size control sections and have n-value more than 0.7 to a depth of 40 in or more. 

Caplen soils have n-value more than 1.0 to a depth of more than 40 ines. Surfside soils have vertic properties and have very-fine particle-size control sections. 

Tracosa soils have a ochric epipedon and have a peraquic moisture regime. 

Velasco soils have a mollic epipedon more than 30 in thick, B horizons with hue redder than 7.5YR, and a very-fine particle-size control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: saline clay derived from Halocene age fluviomarine deposits 
Landscape: Low Coastal Plain 
Landform: Intermediate to brackish marshes 
Slope: less than 1 percent 
Mean annual air temperature range: 20 to 22 degrees C (68 to 72 degrees F) 
Mean annual precipitation range: 1219 to 1575 mm (48 to 62 in) 
Precipitation Pattern: Precipitation is fairly uniform throughout the year with slight peaks in the fall and spring months 
Frost-free period: 270 to 300 days 
Elevation: 0 to 5 m (0 to 15 ft) 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the similar Beaumont, Tracosa, and Surfside series and the Francitas, Galveston, Ijam, Narta, Stowell, and Veston series. 

Beaumont soils are on slightly higher elevations and are better drained. 
Galveston soils are sandy throughout. 
Ijam and Veston soils have an ochric epipedon, and also, Veston soils have a fine-silty control section. 
Narta soils have a natric horizon. 
Stowell soils have a argillic horizon and have a fine-loamy control section. 
Tracosa soils are in lower landscape positions. Surfside soils are in slightly higher landscape positions. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained. Runoff is high. A permanent water table fluctuates from the soil surface to a depth of about 76 cm (30 in). Harris soils are flooded with saline and brackish water to a depth of 0.3 m (1 ft) during high tides. Flooding to a depth of several meters occur during major storms. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. Rice is grown on a small acreage where the soil is protected from flooding by salt water, and water control is maintained. Native vegetation is water-loving and salt tolerant grasses and sedges such as marshhay cordgrass, common reed and seashore saltgrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Texas Gulf Coast from Calhoun County to the Sabine River: LRR T; MLRA 150B and 151 of Texas;. The series is of large extent.
