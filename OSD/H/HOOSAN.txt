HOOSAN SERIES

The Hoosan series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in clayey alluvium.  Hoosan soils are on terraces, fans, and foot slopes.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive Calcic Pachic Haplocryolls

COMPETING SERIES:

Ryman (CO) - does not have horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hoosan soils are on terraces, fans, and foot slopes in the mountain valleys.  Slope gradients are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 4700 to 5600 feet.  Hoosan soils formed in clayey alluvium weathered from hard calcareous clayey shales, limestone, or calcareous sandstone.  The climate is cool with long cold winters and moist springs and summers.  Mean annual temperature is 30 to 42 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 19 to 30 inches.  The growing season is 50 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Adel, Kildor, Raynesford, Skaggs, and Waybe series.  Kildor and Skaggs soils are moderately deep to shale or limestone.  Adel and Raynesford soils have a fine-loamy control section.  The Waybe soils are shallow to clayey shale.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for hay, pasture, cropland, and rangeland.  Native vegetation consists of basin wildrye, western wheatgrass, Columbia needlegrass, bearded wheatgrass, big bluegrass, basin wildrye, forbs, and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Intermountain valleys of central Montana.  Hoosan soils are inextensive.
