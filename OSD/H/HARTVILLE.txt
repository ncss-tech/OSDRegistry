HARTVILLE SERIES 

The Hartville series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium or colluvium on high terraces, strath terraces, and foot slopes along major stream valleys.  Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 42 inches, and mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, mesic Aquic Hapludalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hartville silt loam - on a 2 percent southeast-facing slope in a pasture at an elevation of 1,415 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

   Ap--0 to 7 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; weak very fine granular structure; very friable; few fine strongly cemented iron-manganese concretions; very strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 9 inches thick) 

   E--7 to 11 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam; moderate very fine granular structure; very friable; few fine strongly cemented iron-manganese concretions; very strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 6 inches thick) 

   BE--11 to 14 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam; moderate very fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine moderately cemented iron-manganese concretions; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 9 inches thick) 

   Bt1--14 to 20 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silty clay loam; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few faint clay films on faces of peds; few fine moderately cemented iron-manganese concretions; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.

   Bt2--20 to 41 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silty clay; weak fine subangular blocky structure; firm; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; common prominent gray (10YR 5/1) iron depletions in ped interiors; few fine moderately cemented iron-manganese concretions; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.

   Bt3--41 to 51 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay; weak fine angular and subangular blocky structure; very firm; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; common prominent gray (10YR 5/1) iron depletions in ped interiors; few fine moderately cemented iron-manganese concretions; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. 

   Bt4--51 to 66 inches; mottled gray (10YR 6/1), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), and pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay; weak fine angular blocky structure; very firm; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; few fine black moderately cemented iron-manganese concretions; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 24 to 80 inches.) 

   2BC--66 to 78 inches; mottled yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) and light gray (10YR 7/1) very gravelly clay; weak very fine angular blocky structure, light gray material is massive; very firm; many coarse black masses of iron and manganese accumulation; 60 percent subrounded chert gravel; neutral. 

TYPE LOCATION:  Wright County, Missouri; about 1.5 miles southwest of Hartville, 2,568 feet south and 660 feet west of the northeast corner, sec. 2, T. 29 N., R. 15 W; USGS Hartville quadrangle.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 48 to 80 or more inches. Rock fragments by volume range from 0 to 20 percent in the Ap, AE, E, BE, and upper Bt horizons, 0 to 25 percent in the lower Bt horizon, and 0 to 70 percent in the 2Bt, 2BC, and 2C horizons. The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches is 55 to 59 degrees F. 

The Ap horizon has value of 3 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.

The E or AE horizon has has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral. 

The BE horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam. 

The upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. There are iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay. The lower part of the Bt horizon is variable in color ranging in hue from 10R to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 1 to 8.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Reaction is extremely acid to mildly alkaline. Some pedons have a Btg horizon with chroma of 2 or less. 

The 2Bt, 2Btg, 2BC, and 2C horizons (where present) have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay, or their gravelly or very gravelly analogues. Reaction is extremely acid to moderately alkaline. 

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Banister, Branchville, Cardinal, Celina, Eudy, Jerktail, Loudon, Tarlton, and Whippany series. Banister soils formed in clayey alluvium.  Branchville soils have 15 to 60 percent sandstone fragments in the upper part of the series control section. Cardinal soils have a mean annual soil temperature of less than 53 degrees F. Celina soils have sola less than 40 inches thick and have free carbonates from 18 to 40 inches. Eudy soils are 20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact. Jerktail soils have a lithic contact from 60 to 80 inches. Loudon soils have carbonates from 32 to 65 inches and have a lithic or paralithic contact from 40 to 70 inches. Tarlton soils have a lithic or paralithic contact from 20 to 40 inches. Whippany soils have a mean annual soil temperature of less than 55 degrees F. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hartville soils are on high stream terraces, strath terraces, and footslopes along major stream valleys.  They formed in colluvium and alluvium mainly from limestone and shale.  Slopes are linear and slightly concave.  Most areas receive runoff from higher adjacent areas.  Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches, and mean annual temperature from 54 to 57 degrees F. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Freeburg, Gatewood, Gunlock, Moniteau, Ocie, and Razort soils.  Freeburg and Moniteau soils are fine-silty and Razort soils are fine-loamy.  These soils are on lower terraces and floodplains below Hartville soils.  Gatewood soils are very-fine, Gunlock soils are moderately well drained and Ocie soils are loamy-skeletal over clayey.  These soils are on upland sideslopes and footslopes above the Hartville soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  Runoff potential is ypically high to very high, but is negligible in concave positions. Permeability is slow, and the saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low. A seasonal high water table is at 1.5 to 3.0 feet during the winter and early spring in most years.  Some areas are subject to rare flooding.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used for pasture and hayland.  A small percentage is cropped to row crops and small grains.  Native vegetation is hardwood forest. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The Ozarks Region (MLRAs 116A and 116B) of southern Missouri. The series is of moderate extent.
