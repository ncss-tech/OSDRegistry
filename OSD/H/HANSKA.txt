HANSKA SERIES

The Hanska series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of loamy sediments and the underlying sandy glacial outwash or lacustrine sediments. These soils are on slightly concave to slightly convex slopes on glacial outwash plains, lake plains and valley trains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 765 millimeters. Mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Brown County, Minnesota, 1949.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 48 centimeters (Ap and A horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 48 to 97 centimeters (Bg1 and 2Bg2 horizons);
aquic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
