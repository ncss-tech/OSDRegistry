HAPPYDITCH SERIES

The Happyditch series consists of very deep, well drained, rapidly permeable soils formed in sandy alluvium. These soils are on flood plains in the river valleys of the Central High Tablelands (MLRA 72). Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F (13 degrees C), and mean annual precipitation is 18 inches (46 centimeters). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Aridic Ustifluvents 

TYPICAL PEDON: Happyditch - loamy fine sand - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.) 

   A--0 to 7 inches (0 to 18 centimeters); brown (10YR 5/3) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and medium roots throughout; strongly effervescent throughout; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary. (4 to 12 inches thick, 10 to 30 centimeters) 

   AC--7 to 18 inches (18 to 46 centimeters); pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy fine sand stratified with thin layers of fine sandy loam and loam textures, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and medium roots throughout and common coarse throughout; strongly effervescent throughout; slightly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 15 inches thick, 0 to 38 centimeters) 

   C1--18 to 50 inches (46 to 127 centimeters); very pale brown (10YR 7/4) fine sand stratified with thin layers of fine sandy loam and loam textures, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots throughout; neutral; gradual wavy boundary. 

   C2--50 to 64 inches (127 to 163 centimeters) ; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sand stratified with thin layers of fine sandy loam and loam textures, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 10 percent subrounded mixed gravel; neutral; gradual wavy boundary. 

   C3--64 to 76 inches (163 to 193 centimeters); pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sand stratified with thin layers of loam texture, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; common fine and medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) irregular shaped iron accumulations throughout; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; neutral; gradual wavy boundary. 

   C4--76 to 80 inches (193 to 203 centimeters); pale brown (10YR 6/3) sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 2 percent subrounded mixed gravel; neutral. 

TYPE LOCATION: Morton County, Kansas; about 6 miles (9.5 kilometers) north and 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) west of Rolla; 2800 feet (853 meters) north and 2300 feet (701 meeters) west of the southeast corner, sec. 3, T. 33 S., R. 40 W; 37 degrees, 12 minutes, 27 seconds north latitude; 101 degrees, 39 minutes, 13 seconds west longitude. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture regime: ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic
Soil temperature regime: mesic
Mean annual soil temperature: 54 to 58 degrees F (12 to 14 degrees C).
Particle-size control section: sandy
Depth to bedrock: deeper than 80 inches (203 centimeters)
Depth to secondary calcium carbonate: 0 to 30 inches (0 to 75 centimeters)
Thickness of the ochric epipedon: 4 to 9 inches (10 to 23 centimeters) 

A horizon: 
Hue: 10YR
Value: 5 or 6 (dry) 4 or 5 (moist)
Chroma: 3 to 4
Texture: loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or sand
Reaction: neutral or slightly alkaline 

AC horizon: 
Hue: 10YR
Value: 5 or 6 (dry) 4 or 5 (moist)
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or sand
Reaction: neutral or slightly alkaline 

C horizon: 
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR 
Value: 5 to 7 (dry) 3 to 5 (moist)
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: fine sand, or sand
Reaction: neutral or slightly alkaline 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Broadwater (NE), Levante (NM), Pathfinder (NE) series. The Broadwater and Levante series contain greater than 15 percent gravel in the lower portion of the soil profile. The Pathfinder series has iron masses within the soil profile. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Happyditch soils are on flood plains. They are rarely to frequently flooded. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. They are formed in sandy alluvium. Mean annual temperature is 54 to 58 degrees F (12 to 14 degrees C)., average annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches ( 40 to 50 centimeters). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Atchison, Glenberg, Optima, and Otero, series. Atchison soils have a fine-loamy control section and are on higher positions. Glenberg soils have a coarse-loamy control section. Optima soils are not stratified and are on higher positions. Otero soils have a coarse-loamy control section and are on higher positions. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow runoff; rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are mainly used for rangeland. Native vegetation consists of scattered cottonwood, salt cedar, grasses, and brush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwest Kansas. The series is of small extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Morton County, Kansas, 1994 

REMARKS: This series is being proposed to replace Bankard series. Bankard series is mapped in a drier climate. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - The zone from the surface to a depth of 7 inches (0 to 18 centimeters).
