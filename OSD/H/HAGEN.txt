HAGEN SERIES

The Hagen series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glaciofluvial deposits mixed with minor amounts of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. Hagen soils are on terraces and terrace escarpments. Slopes are 0 to 40 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TYPE LOCATION: Spokane County, Washington; About 1.25 miles north of Dartford, Washington.  About 300 feet north and 2550 feet east of the southwest corner of Section 30, Township 27N, Range 43E. , W.M.; USGS Deer Park, Wash. Topographic quadrangle (Latitude 47 degrees, 48 minutes, 8 seconds N. and Longitude 117 degrees, 25 minutes, 15 seconds W.) NAD83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: These soils are dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 75 to 90 consecutive days in the summer and autumn. The average annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 51 degrees F. The particle-size control section is loamy sand, loamy fine sand or sand. Coarse fragments average less than 5 percent.  Depth to loamy sand or loamy fine sand ranges from 12 to 24 inches. The upper 7 to 20 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.20 to 1.40 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.4 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent (air-dried).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hagen soils are on outwash terraces at elevations of 1,400 to 2,400 feet. Slopes are 0 to 40 percent. The soils formed in glaciofluvial deposits mixed with minor amounts of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. These soils have warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 17 to 24 inches. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F.; average January temperature is 25 degrees F., and average July temperature is 67 degrees F. The frost-free period is 100 to 130 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bisbee, Bonner, Clayton, Eloika, Koerling and Marble soils. Bisbee soils lack lamellae and are on dune-like terraces. Bonner soils have a coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal control section and are on terraces. Clayton, Eloika and Koerling soils have a coarse-loamy control section and are on terraces. Marble soils have a texture of loamy fine sand or coarser throughout the particle-size control section and are on dune-like terraces. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for the production of timber; cleared areas are used for alfalfa hay production. Potential natural vegetation is lodgepole pine, ponderosa pine, scattered Douglas fir and western larch, pinegrass, strawberry, yarrow and kinnickinnick. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern Washington; MLRA 43. Series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Spokane County, Washington, 1964. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 7 inches (Ap horizon)
Cambic horizon - the zone from 7 to 15 inches (Bw horizon)
Vitrandic feature - the zone from 0 to 15 inches
Lamellic feature - the zone from 15 to 52 inches
Particle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches (lower part of Bw horizon, the E&Bt1, and upper E&Bt2 horizons) 

The classification of this series revised as of 5/00 from sandy, mixed, mesic Typic Xerorthents to sandy, mixed, mesic Vitrandic Haploxerepts based on revisions to Soil Taxonomy and recognition of a cambic horizon in the series concept. The 5/00 draft also reflected a change in drainage class from somewhat excessively drained to well drained based on the presence of lamellae and their effect on water movement.

Further investigation was completed  in regards to the soil temperature regime. As of 02/2003 the type location has been moved to reflect a more typical habitat and temperature regime.  The original type location resided in an area that has been correlated to Kaniksu, in a frigid soil temperature regime.

Mineralogy changed to isotic 10/01.
