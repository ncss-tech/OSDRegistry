HEWOLF SERIES

The Hewolf series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium.  These soils are on low stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Fluventic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hewolf gravelly loam, in irrigated grass pasture.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

    Ap--0 to 7 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; 20 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 11 inches thick)

    Bw--7 to 13 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very gravelly sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; 40 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 8 inches thick)

    2C--13 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely gravelly sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; 60 percent pebbles; neutral.  (pH 7.0)

TYPE LOCATION:  Sanders County, Montana; 700 feet south and 1500 feet east of the northwest corner of sec. 27, T. 18 N., R. 21 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  

Soil temperature - 43 to 47 degrees F.

Moisture control section - between 12 and 35 inches.

Mollic epipedon thickness - 7 to 11 inches.  The soil when mixed to a depth of 7 inches meets the requirements of a mollic epipedon.  Unmixed areas have an erratic carbon distribution.

Depth to seasonal high water table - 60 to 72 inches.

Control section - 0 to 6 percent clay and 35 to 75 percent rock fragments.


A horizon - Value:  4 or 5 dry; 2 or 3 moist

Chroma:  1, 2 or 3

Clay content:  8 to 15 percent

Rock fragments:  15 to 35 percent - 0 to 5 percent cobbles; 15 to 30 percent pebbles 

Reaction:  pH 6.6 to 7.3


Bw horizon - Value:  5 or 6 dry; 4 or 5 moist

Chroma:  2 or 3

Texture:  sandy loam, fine sandy loam

Clay content:  5 to 15 percent

Rock fragments:  35 to 60 percent - 0 to 10 percent cobbles; 35 to 50 percent pebbles

Reaction:  pH 6.6 to 7.3


2C - Value:  6 or 7 dry; 4, 5 or 6 moist

Chroma:  2 or 3

Texture:  sand or loamy sand

Clay content:  0 to 5 percent

Rock fragments:  45 to 75 percent - 0 to 10 percent cobbles; 45 to 65 percent pebbles

Reaction:  pH 6.6 to 7.3

COMPETING SERIES:

Mippon (WA) - have mollic colors to a depth of 60 inches; do not have a cambic horizon.

Smout (ID) - have a mollic epipedon 11 to 18 inches thick; do not have a cambic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - low stream terraces in mountain valleys.

Elevation - 2500 to 2900 feet.

Slope - 0 to 2 percent.

Parent material - alluvium.

Climate - long cold winters, moist springs, warm, dry summers.

Mean annual precipitation - 14 to 18 inches, much of which falls as snow and spring rains.

Mean annual temperature - 41 to 45 degrees F.

Frost-free period - 90 to 110 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; moderately rapid over rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used as irrigated and dryland pasture and cropland, and wildlife habitat.  The potential native vegetation is mainly mid and short grasses with riparian shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  These soils are of limited extent in northwestern Montana mountain valleys.
