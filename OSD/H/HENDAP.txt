HENDAP SERIES

The Hendap series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks and calcareous loess.  Hendap soils are on mountain side slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Lithic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Hendap very stony coarse sandy loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The surface is partially covered by approximately 30 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones.

     Oi--0 to 3 cm; slightly decomposed pinyon and juniper needles, twigs, cones and berries; slightly effervescent; abrupt smooth boundary.

     A1--3 to 5 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very stony coarse sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine interstitial pores; 30 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; 10 percent stones; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 8 cm thick)

     A2--5 to 20 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very stony coarse sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; 30 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones; strongly effervescent (less than 2 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to 18 cm thick)

     C--20 to 36 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine, fine and medium and common coarse roots; 55 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles; violently effervescent (4 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear irregular boundary.  (8 to 15 cm thick)

     R--36 cm; granitic bedrock; highly weathered in the upper 10 cm.

TYPE LOCATION:  Elko County, Nevada; approximately 550 feet  south and 1,450 feet west of the northeast corner of section 33, T. 28 N., R. 68 E.; USGS White Horse Mountain 7.5 minute quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 15 minutes 35 seconds N and longitude 114 degrees 18 minutes 04 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.2597222 latitude, -114.3011111 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist late fall through early spring, dry late spring through mid fall; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean Annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon: 18 to 25 cm thick.
Depth to bedrock: 25 to 50 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 6 to 12 percent.
Rock fragments: Averages 40 to 70 percent, dominantly 2 to 5 mm granitic fragments. 30 to 65 percent, gravel; 5 to 20 percent cobbles; 0 to 5 percent,stones.

A horizons 
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 5 percent of the less than 2 mm fraction.
Carbonates: Slightly effervescent or strongly effervescent.

C horizon 
Texture: Extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand and extremely gravelly coarse sandy loam.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 10 percent of the less than 2 mm fraction.
Carbonates: Slightly effervescent to violently effervescent

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Aldax, Bakeoven, Borid, Couleedam, Cox, and Lickskillet series. 

Aldax soils have mollic epipedons that include the entire profile. Bakeoven and Lickskillet soils contain more than 18 percent clay in the control section. Borid, Couleedam and Cox soils are noneffervescent.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hendap soils are on mountain side slopes.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks and calcareous loess.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. Elevations are 1,830 to 2,595 meters.  The climate is cold, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 410 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cucamungo soils.  Cucamungo soils have and argillic horizon and a frigid soil temperature.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; rapid runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Woodland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly singleleaf pinyon, Utah juniper, black sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Nevada. MLRA 28B.  These soils are not extensive.

SERIES PROPOSED:  Elko County, Nevada, Southeast Part, 1991. The name is coined.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the mineral surface (3 cm) to a depth of approximately 20 cm (A1 and A2 horizons).
Lithic contact - The point at approximately 36 cm (R layer).
Particle-size control section - The zone from the mineral surface (3 cm) to 36 cm (A1, A2 and C horizons).

Classification was updated to 11th edition on 07/2011 changed Lithic Haploxerolls to Aridic Lithic Haploxerolls.
