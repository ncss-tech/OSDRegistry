SERIES ESTABLISHED: Halifax County, Virginia, 2004.

REMARKS: Halifax soils were previously mapped as Helena soils. The creation of a mesic region within the southern Piedmont necessitated a new series be established as a counterpart to the Helena series. 

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 13 inches (Ap horizon)
Aquic conditions--periodic saturation and reduction in a zone from 25 to 60 inches at some time during the year.
Argillic horizon--the zone from 13 to 58 inches (Btg horizons)
Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches
