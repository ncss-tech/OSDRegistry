HIORE SERIES 

The Hiore series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium, slope alluvium and residuum derived from coarse-grained igneous rocks.  These soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryepts 

TYPICAL PEDON: Hiore coarse sandy loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

  Oi--0 to 1 inch; forest litter of partially decomposed needles and twigs. 

  A1--1 to 3 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) coarse sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium and coarse roots; many very fine and very fine pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary.

  A2--3 to 8 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine pores; 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual smooth boundary. (4 to 14 inches thick) 

  Bw1--8 to 23 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and few medium roots; common fine pores; 30 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual smooth boundary.

(Combined thickness of Bw horizons - 20 to 34 inches). 

  BC--36 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly loamy coarse sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 60 percent gravel; few medium roots; neutral (pH 7.2).

USE AND VEGETATION: Hiore soils are used mainly for timber production, understory grazing, watersheds, and as wildlife habitat.  The potential native vegetation is mainly Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine, rough fescue, pine grass, elk sedge, common juniper, and woods pussytoes. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Hiore soils are of small extent in Southwestern Montana. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Jefferson County, Montana, 1998. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon from - 0 to 8 inches (Oi, A1, A2 horizons)
Cambic horizon from - 8 to 36 inches (Bw1, Bw2 horizons)
Particle-size control section from - 11 to 41 inches (part of Bw1, Bw2, part of BC horizons)

Hiore soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime. 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Soil interpretation record MT1530.

Note: The 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Eutrocryepts to Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.

Note: The current profile has a sandy-skeletal textural family.  A new type location with a loamy-skeletal textural family will be found by the Dillon, MT Soil Survey Office. Currently, the following surveys are using Hiore - MT605, MT627, MT632, MT635, MT637 and MT670. (04/19/2011)
