HERBERGER SERIES

The Herberger series consists of moderately deep to a densic layer, well drained soils formed in tuffaceous sediments over glaciofluvial deposits with a minor influence of volcanic ash in the surface layers. They are found on fan remnants and outwash plains.  Slopes are 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches (430 millimeters), and the mean annual temperature is 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, smectitic, frigid Pachic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Herberger ashy clay loam - rangeland, on a 2 percent slope at an elevation of 1,460 meters.  (When described on September 14, 2011, the soil was dry throughout.  Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

3Cd2--45 to 57 inches (114 to 145 cm); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) dense glacial till crushes to loamy coarse sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3) dry; massive; hard, very firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; 10 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are Arva, Broadhead, Bumpheads, Cristo, Henefer, Lostpepper, Rugar, Schnipps, and Sweitberg series.  All of these soils lack a densic layer.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Herberger soils are on outwash plains and fan remnants.  Elevations range from 1,370 to 1,525 meters.  Slopes are 2 to 20 percent.  They formed in tuffaceous sediments over glaciofluvial deposits with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface layers.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches (350 to 500 millimeters).  The mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C.  The frost free period is 30 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Fopiano, Gerow, Laycock, Lemke (T), Luckycreek, Pothole (T), Prag, Rastus, Silvies, Skullgulch, Southworth (T), and Sylvaille (T) soils.  Fopiano and Prag soils are found on sideslopes of fan remnants.  Fopiano soils are shallow to a paralithic contact whereas Prag is moderately deep.  Gerow and Silvies soils are located on broad floodplains.  Gerow and Silvies soils have redoximorphic concentrations within 76 cm of the soil surface.  Laycock and Southworth soils are on hills, have an "O" horizon, and are shallow and moderately deep to shale bedrock, respectively.  Lemke soils are on fan remnants and have an "O" horizon and are shallow to a densic layer.  Luckycreek soils are on broad terraces, are fine-loamy, and very deep to any bedrock.  Pothole soils occur as bowl-shaped depressions on fan remnants and are in the "fine-loamy ovDer clayey" family.  Rastus soils are moderately deep to a duripan and are located on fan remnants with Herburger soils.  Skullgulch soils are in small swales of fan remnants and lack any root restrictive layer and are in the fine family.  Sylvaille soils are on outwash plains, are loamy, and are shallow to a densic layer.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow permeability 

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The potential native vegetation is dominated by mountain big sagebrush, Idaho fescue, Sandberg bluegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, parsnip flower buckwheat, and prairie junegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central Oregon.  MLRA B10.  This series is not extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES PROPOSED:  Grant County, Oregon.  2011.  The name is derived from Herberger Spring and the Herberger family who were early residents of Bear Valley.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon (pachic):  zone from the surface to 61 cm (A, 2Bt1, and 2Bt2 horizons)

Vitrandic feature:  zone from the surface to 0 to 10 cm (A horizon).  The A horizon is not sufficiently thick to qualify for the vitrandic subgroup.

Argillic horizon: zone from 10 to 61 cm (2Bt1 and 2Bt2 horizons)

Particle-size control section:  zone from 10 to 60 cm (2Bt1 and 2Bt2 horizons)

Densic layers:  zone from 61 to 145 cm (3Cd1 and 3Cd2 horizons)

Soil moisture regime: Xeric

Frequently the soil surface is littered with sub-rounded, gravel-sized fragments of shale, tuff, limestone, serpentine, and occasionally obsidian.
