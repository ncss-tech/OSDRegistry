HALL SERIES

The Hall series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in loess or alluvium.  These soils are on uplands and stream terraces of Central Nebraska Loess Hills, MLRA 71. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C. (51 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 660 millimeters (26 inches) at the type location.

Detroit, Hastings and Wood River soils are on similar landform positions and have greater than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section.  
Holdrege soils are on similar landform positions and have a dark surface (mollic epipedon) less than 50 centimeters (10 inches) thick.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage: well
Runoff: low to medium
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: moderately high

USE AND VEGETATION:  Nearly all the acreage is in cultivated cropland.  
Much of the cropland is irrigated. Corn, grain sorghum, soybeans, and alfalfa are the principal crops. A small acreage is still in native grass, mainly mid and tall species.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Nebraska and possibly north-central Kansas.(LRR H Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range, MLRA 71, Central Nebraska Loess Hills, MLRA 73, Rolling Plains and Breaks, and MLRA 75 Central Loess Plains, LRR M Central Feed Grains and Livestock Region, MLRA 102C Loess Uplands, LRR G Western Great Plains Range and Irrigated Region, MLRA 65 Nebraska Sand Hills.) The series is extensive.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:  Mollic epipedon: 0 to 61 centimeters (0 to 24 inches) (Ap, A, Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)

Modified format by LRM in 10/2005 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.

7/2011 JLG
Added soil temperature regime, added mean annul soil temperature, added depth to argillic horizon, added particle size clay and sand in RIC, added sand and clay percent to horizon data in RIC, added quadrangle information, updated competing series, added frost free days, and updated additional laboratory data. Changed precipitation values from centimeters to millimeters. 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Data for typical pedon is from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska; pedon 52NE079003. Additional laboratory data- National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska; pedon 52NE079002, 49NE079010, and 79NE073001. Physical and chemical data for two profiles of Hall soils are given on pages 56-59 of Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 5, "Soil Survey Laboratory Data and Descriptions for Some Soils of Nebraska."
