HOPPERS SERIES

The Hoppers series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in interbedded sandstone, siltstone, and shale residuum.  These soils are found on hills.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record: MT1624. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to 15 inches (A, Bt1 horizons)
Argillic horizon (which is also the particle-size control section) - the zone from 8 to 26 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizons)
Paralithic contact - the zone from 26 to 33 inches (Cr horizon)
Lithic contact - at 33 inches (R horizon) 

Hoppers soils have an ustic moisture regime and a frigid temperature regime.
