HERMIT SERIES

The Hermit series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in tephra.  Hermit soils are on mountains.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Medial over loamy, mixed, superactive Xeric Haplocryands

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hermit sandy loam on a NE facing 9 percent slope under a cover of white fir and ponderosa pine at an elevation of 6400 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.  When described August 12, 1985, the soil was dry throughout).

    Oi--2 to 0 inches; recent and decomposed fir and pine litter.

    A1--0 to 3 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); abrupt wavy boundary.

    A2--3 to 8 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and medium and few very fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear smooth boundary.

    A3--8 to 15 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and few medium and coarse roots; few very fine tubular and common very fine interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the A1, A2, and A3  horizons is 14 to 18 inches).

    2Bw--15 to 26 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common medium and fine and few coarse roots; common very fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary.  (11 to 15 inches thick).

    3Bt--26 to 42 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common medium and few fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; few thin clay films on gravel; 50 percent weathered gravel; NaF pH 9.4; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary.  (15 to 27 inches thick).

    3Cr--42 inches; soft weathered andesite.

TYPE LOCATION:  Modoc County, California; about 12 miles southeast of Canby; 2,400 feet west and 1,500 feet south of the northeast corner of sec. 26, T. 40 N., R. 10 E., Canby SE (Hermit Butte) quadrangle (7.5 minute series).

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 25 to 42 inches thick.   Depth to paralithic contact is 40 to 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 38 to 44 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 44 to 46 degrees F. with an O horizon.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. from mid May to early November and exceeds 47 degrees F. from mid July to early September.  The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from mid July to mid September (50 to 75 days) and is moist in all parts from early November to mid June.  Base saturation by ammonium acetate ranges from 50 to 75 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid or moderately acid.

The A horizon color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/3 or 7.5YR 4/2. Moist color is 10YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3 or 7.5YR 3/2.  Organic matter ranges from 2.0 to 4.0 percent.  Clay content ranges from 9 to 15 percent.  Rock fragments, mostly gravel range from 0 to 15 percent.  Average 15 bar water is 18 to 21 percent.  Bulk density ranges from 0.70 to 0.85.  Glass ranges from 7 to 15 percent. Aluminum and 1/2 iron (by ammonium oxalate) is 2.0 or more.  Bulk density is less than 0.85 g/cm3.

The 2Bw horizon color is 10YR 4/3, 5/3 or 7.5YR 4/2. Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3 or 7.5YR 3/2.  Organic matter ranges from 1.0 to 3 percent.  Clay content ranges from 15 to 18 percent.  Rock fragments, mostly gravel, range from 0 to 15 percent.  Bulk density ranges from 1.00 to 1.20.

The 3Bt horizon color is 10YR 4/3, 5/3 or 5/2.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3 or 7.5YR 3/2.  Organic matter ranges from 1.0 to 2.0 percent.  Clay content ranges from 18 to 27 percent.  Rock fragments, mostly weathered gravel range from 35 to 60 percent.  Bulk density ranges from 1.0 to 1.2.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hermit soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  These soils formed in tephra.  Elevation is 6000 to 7100 feet.   The climate is subhumid with cool dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 20 to 25 inches.  Snowfall is 48 to 72 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 38 to 43 degrees F.  The mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F.  The mean July temperature is about 55 degrees F. Frost-free period is 40 to 50 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Canyoncreek, Gosch, and Witcher soils.  Canyoncreek soils are medial over loamy-skeletal.  Gosch soils are loamy-skeletal, have an ochric epipedon and are frigid.  Witcher soils have an ochric epipedon and are frigid.  Gosch and Witcher soils have andic soil properties from the surface to about 10 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  This soil is used for timber production.  Small areas are used as urban development.  The vegetation is white fir, ponderosa pine, snowbrush, ceanothus, sierra chinkapin, sticky currant and bitter cherry, western serviceberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern California.  The soils are not extensive.  MLRA is 22.
