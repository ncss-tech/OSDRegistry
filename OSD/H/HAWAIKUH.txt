HAWAIKUH SERIES

The Hawaikuh series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slow and slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium, fan alluvium, and stream alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Hawaikuh soils are on fan terraces on valley sides and stream terraces on valley floors. Slopes range from 1 to  6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Hawaikuh silt loam--rangeland (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)
 A--0 to 3 inches; yellowish red (5YR 4/6) silt loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; weak medium granular structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; few medium and many fine and very fine roots; common fine irregular pores; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick)
 Btk1--3 to 12 inches; red (2.5YR 4/6) silty clay loam, reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; common fine irregular pores; many prominent clay films on faces of peds; strongly effervescent; calcium carbonate occurs as few fine irregular soft masses; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.
 Btk2--12 to 29 inches; red (2.5YR 4/6) clay loam, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; common prominent clay films on faces of peds; strongly effervescent; calcium carbonate occurs as common fine irregular soft filaments and masses; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (The combined thickness of the Btk horizons is 26 to 35 inches.)
 Bk1--29 to 39 inches; red (2.5YR 5/6) sandy clay loam, reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; calcium carbonate occurs as common fine irregular soft filaments and masses; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.
 Bk2--39 to 54 inches; reddish brown (2.5YR 5/4) sandy loam, reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; strongly effervescent; calcium carbonate occurs as common fine irregular soft filaments and masses; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.
Bk3--54 to 65 inches; light red (2.5YR 6/6) silty clay loam, reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; violently effervescent; calcium carbonate occurs as common fine irregular soft filaments and masses; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4). (The combined thickness of the Bk horizons is 30 to 40 inches.)

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Chafin (NM), Lonti (AZ), Mags (CO), Padilla (AZ), Servilleta (NM), Silver (NM) and Tobish (UT) series. Chaffin, Mags and Silver soils have hues yellower than 7.5YR. Lonti soils have 5 to 35 percent rock fragments and do not have secondary calcium carbonate in the argillic horizon. Padilla soils have an argillic horizon that extends beyond 40 inches, and are not stratified in the Bk horizon. Servilleta soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Tobish soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Hawaikuh soils formed in alluvium, fan alluvium, and stream alluvium derived from sandstone and shale and are on fan teraces on valley sides and stream terraces on valley floors. Slopes are 1 to  6 percent. Elevations range from 5,800 to 6,900 feet. The mean annual air temperature is 49 to 54 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches. The frost free period is 120 to 165 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the shallow Tekapo soils on escarpments; the medium textured. Aquima and Redpen soils on fan terraces; the medium textured and very-fine textured Ojocal and Venadito soils on flood plains and alluvial fans. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, medium runoff, and moderately slow and slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: This series is used for livestock grazing. The present vegetation is blue grama, western wheatgrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, needleandthread, galleta, sand dropseed, Indian ricegrass, fourwing saltbush, winterfat, spineless horsebrush, and rubber rabbitbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West central New Mexico and northern Arizona. MLRA 35, LRR-D. This series is of moderate extent.
