HODEDO SERIES

The Hodedo series consists of moderately deep over an indurated duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Hodedo soils are on fan piedmont remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Argiduridic Durixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hodedo cobbly loam--woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is covered with 1 to 3 percent stones.

    A--0 to 15 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) cobbly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium platy structure parting to moderate medium granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; many fine and very fine vesicular pores; 10 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (15 to 25 cm thick)

    Bt1--15 to 28 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) cobbly clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak medium angular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine interstitial and tubular pores; common faint pressure faces on peds; 15 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 20 cm thick)

    Bt2--28 to 51 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) gravelly clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; strong medium angular blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common distinct pressure faces on peds; 20 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (18 to 30 cm thick)

    Bqkm--51 to 74 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) indurated duripan, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; extremely hard, extremely firm, strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (20 to 30 cm thick)

    Cq--74 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely cobbly loamy coarse sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; hard, firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine interstitial pores; continuously weakly silica-cemented; 20 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  Eureka County, Nevada; approximately 27 miles west of Eureka about 2,620 feet east and 990 feet north of the southwest corner of section 5, T. 18 N., R. 49 E.; USGS Antelope Peak 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 27 minutes 35 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 28 minutes 35 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.4597222 latitude, -116.4808333 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist winter and spring, dry July through October; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 18 to 30 cm.
Depth of indurated duripan: 50 to 66 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay:  35 to 45 percent.
Rock fragments:  15 to 35 percent, gravel and cobbles.

A horizon
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Reaction: Slightly acid or neutral.

Bt horizon
Hue:  10YR or 7.5YR.
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4.
Texture:  Gravelly clay loam, cobbly clay loam or cobbly clay.
Structure: angular blocky or subangular blocky.
Consistence: Slightly hard to very hard, friable or firm, sticky or very sticky and plastic or very plastic.
Reaction: Slightly acid or neutral.

Bqkm horizon
Value:  7 or 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist.
C horizon: Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Reaction: Slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Edemaps and Tanner series.   

Edemaps have bedrock at 50 to 90 cm. Tanner soils have a duripan less than 20 cm thick.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hodedo soils are on remnants on the upper parts of fan piedmonts.  These soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 1,895 to 2,290 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with warm dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Coils soil which lacks a mollic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Woodland, livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly singleleaf pinyon, Utah juniper, big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, bluegrass, and Idaho fescue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 28B.
