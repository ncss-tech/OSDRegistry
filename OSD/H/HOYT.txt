HOYT SERIES

The Hoyt series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium derived from igneous bedrock and glacial till.  These soils are on mountains, moraines, hills and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hoyt loam, 8 to 15 percent slopes, in woodland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--1 inch to 0; partially decomposed twigs and needles.

    A1--0 to 6 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; common very fine irregular pores; 10 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 8 inches)

    A2--6 to 12 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; common skeletans of light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) unstained sand and silt grains; 15 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt1--12 to 23 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; common faint dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; 15 percent pebbles; 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 13 inches thick)

    Bt2--23 to 37 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) gravelly sandy clay loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and few medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; common distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; 15 percent pebbles; 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 21 inches thick)

    BC--37 to 60 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) gravelly coarse sandy loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; massive; soft, friable, moderately sticky and nonplastic; few fine and medium roots; 15 percent pebbles; 5 percent cobbles; common very fine irregular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).
