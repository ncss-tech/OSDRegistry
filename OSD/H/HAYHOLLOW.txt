HAYHOLLOW SERIES

The Hayhollow series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed from mixed stream alluvium.  Hayhollow soils are on flood plains and stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, nonacid, thermic Aridic Ustifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hayhollow sand - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; slightly decomposed oak and sycamore leaves

    C1--2 to 9 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) sand, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; single grained; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine vesicular pores; 10 percent gravel; noneffervescent; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    C2--9 to 22 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine and few medium roots; many fine irregular and tubular pores; noneffervescent; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt smooth boundary.

    C3--22 to 34 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) sand, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine, fine and few medium roots; many fine irregular and tubular pores, common fine vesicular pores; slightly effervescent; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.

    C4--34 to 51 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; common medium vesicular and many fine irregular and tubular pores; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary.

    C5-- 51 to 60 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; many medium irregular and tubular pores; noneffervescent; moderately acid (pH 6.0).  (combined thickness of C2, C3, C4 and C5 is 10 to 60 inches)

TYPE LOCATION:  Cochise County, Arizona; located at a latitude of 31 degrees, 20 minutes, 34 seconds North and longitude of 109 degrees, 04 minutes, 07 seconds West. Located 1.6 miles east from locked gate in Guadalupe Canyon Wash.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July - September and December - February.  Driest during May and June.  Aridic ustic soil moisture regime.

Soil Temperature - 59 to 64 degrees F.
	      
Rock fragments:  less than 35 percent, but can range to 50 percent in any one horizon 

Reaction:  moderately acid to neutral

Clay content:  3 to 15 percent 

Organic Matter: 1 to 3 percent

C horizon
Hue:  10YR, 7.5YR
Value:  2 through 5 dry, 2 through 4 moist
Chroma:  1 through 4, dry or moist
Texture:  sand, sandy loam, coarse sand and fine sandy loam

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Levelland (TX) series. The Levelland soils formed in parent material weathered from the Blackwater Draw Formation on the Southern High Plains-MLRA 77.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hayhollow soils are on flood plains and stream terraces at elevations of 4,300 to 5,300 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  These soils formed mixed stream alluvium. The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December and January.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 62 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 160 to 210 days.  

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Magoffin and Cherrycow soils. Magoffin and Cherrycow soils are shallow and moderately deep to bedrock.
  
DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Hayhollow soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation includes sideoats grama, blue grama, cane beardgrass, deergrass, oak, juniper, sycamore, and cottonwood.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Arizona.  Hayhollow soils are of limited extent. This soil occurs in LRR-D, MLRA 41.
