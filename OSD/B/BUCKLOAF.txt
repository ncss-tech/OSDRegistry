BUCKLOAF SERIES

The Buckloaf series consists of moderately-deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum weathered from sandstone and shale. These soils are on hills, mesas and pediments. Slopes are 1 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Ustic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Buckloaf channery loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 7 cm brown (10YR 4/3) channery loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3), moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable, soft, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 20 percent channers; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 15 cm thick)

    Bk1--7 to 50 cm dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) very channery loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4), moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; many fine tubular pores; 50 percent channers; 5 percent irregular carbonate masses in matrix; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); clear wavy boundary. (20 to 45 cm thick)

    Bk2--50 to 90 cm light gray (10YR 7/2) extremely channery loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; many fine tubular pores; 70 percent channers; 80 percent irregular carbonate masses throughout; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); clear smooth boundary. (35 to 65 cm thick)

    R--90 cm; indurated sandstone bedrock.

Slope - 1 to 6 percent
Parent Material - slope alluvium over residuum weathered from sandstone and shale
Climate - long, cold winters; cool, moist springs; short, cool summers
Mean annual precipitation - 225 to 280 mm with peak periods of precipitation occurring during the spring

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Buckloaf soils are primarily used for rangeland. The potential native vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, squirreltail, Sandberg bluegrass, Indian ricegrass, and other forbs and grasses.   

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Buckloaf soils are of large extent in southwestern Wyoming. MLRA - 34A.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES PROPOSED: Sublette County, Wyoming, 2014. The series name is coined from a local area.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - 0 to 7 cm (A horizon)
Secondary calcium carbonate accumulations - 7 to 90 cm (Bk1, Bk2 horizons)
Calcic horizon - 50 to 90 cm (Bk2 horizon) 
Lithic contact - at 90 cm (R horizon)
Particle-size control section - from 25 to 90 cm (part of Bk1, Bk2 horizons).

Buckloaf soils have a frigid temperature regime and an aridic moisture regime that is bordering on ustic.
