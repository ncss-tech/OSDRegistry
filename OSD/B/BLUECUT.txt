BLUECUT SERIES

The Bluecut series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granite and gneiss or granitoid rocks. The Bluecut soils are on fan aprons over fan remnants and fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series at this time. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Bluecut soils are on fan aprons over fan remnants and fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. These soils formed in alluvium derived granite and gneiss or granitoid rocks. Elevation is 645 to 1310 meters (2,115 to 4,295 feet). The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 175 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is 13 to 20 degrees C. The frost free season is 210 to 320 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Morongo and Yander soils. The Morongo soils are found on fan aprons, are sandy throughout and do not have a diagnostic horizon.  The Yander soils are found on fan aprons over pediment surfaces and have a paralithic contact between 100 and 150 centimeters.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; low to medium runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Bluecut soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat. Vegetation is blackbrush, creosote bush, burrobush, and big galleta.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Mojave Desert of southeastern California; MLRA 30. These soils are of small extent.
