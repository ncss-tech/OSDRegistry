BROWNCHURCH SERIES

The Brownchurch series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in
loamy slope alluvium over silty slope alluvium.  These soils are on hills in bedrock controlled uplands.  Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the loamy slope alluvium and moderate in the silty slope alluvium.  Slope ranges from 12 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 810 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Mollic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Brownchurch sandy loam on a concave, northwest-facing slope of 22 percent, in a cultivated field, at an elevation of 286 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) About 6 percent of the surface is covered by channers.  The fragments are dolostone and sandstone.

    2Bt5--122 to 157 centimeters; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam; weak coarse prismatic structure; friable; few faint brown (10YR 4/3) clay films on faces of peds; few fine roots; about 2 percent dolostone and 2 percent sandstone channers; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary.(Combined thickness of the 2Bt horizons is 50 to 102 centimeters)

    2BC--157 to 203 centimeters; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silt loam; weak coarse prismatic structure; friable; few fine distinct brown (7.5YR 5/4) masses of iron accumulation; about 3 percent dolostone and 2 percent sandstone channers; moderately acid.

TYPE LOCATION: Richland County, Wisconsin; located about 1 mile northwest of Richland Center; about 1,420 feet east and 1,420 feet south of the northwest corner of sec. 7, T. 10 N., R. 1 E.; Richland Center USGS topographic quadrangle; latitude 43 degrees 21 minutes, 41 seconds N; longitude 90 degrees, 25 minutes, 28 seconds W. NAD 83. 

Type location lat long was wrong, MLRA SS Leader sent a corrected lat long to the MO on 10/30/2008.  However; that corrected location is in the woods on a southeast facing slope, so it seems that is still not correct so the MO used its historic type location which puts this pedon on a NW slope in a cultivated field.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Churchtown, Gaphill, and Rockbluff soils near the Type Location.  The Churchtown soils are in similar positions on the landscape.  The Churchtown soils are fine-silty.  The Gaphill and Rockbluff soils are in the steeper backslope positions above the Brownchurch soils.  The Gaphill soils have bedrock within 203 centimeters.  The Rockbluff soils are sandy and have bedrock within 203 centimeters.

Drainage--well drained--a saturated zone does not occur within a depth of 1.8 meters during April to June in normal years

Runoff--low to medium

USE AND VEGETATION: The less sloping areas are used for cropland. Commonly grown crops are corn, small grain, and legume hay.  The steeper slopes are commonly used for woodland. Native vegetation is deciduous trees.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Richland County, Wisconsin, 2002.  Source of the name is from a county road.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: The zone from 0 to 15 centimeters. 
Argillic horizon: The zone from 15 to 157 centimeters.

Brownchurch soils are recognized below backslopes where the sandstone is a significant factor in creating the loamy slope alluvium. The Churchtown series occurs in the same landform position in nearby areas where the sandstone has less influence and are fine-silty. Redox features in the lower part of the profile are relict or an indicator of a zone of near saturation of short duration during wet periods. The internal drainage appears to be restricted by structure differences in the lower part of the argillic horizon and 2BC or 2C horizon. Brownchurch soils, however, are considered to be well drained.
