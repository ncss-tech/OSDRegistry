BOLENT SERIES

The Bolent series consists of very deep somewhat poorly drained soils on flood plains.  They formed in recent sandy alluvium.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 10 degrees C. (49 degrees F.) and the mean annual precipitation is about 51 centimeters (20 inches) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Aquic Ustifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Bolent loamy fine sand, on a 1 percent slope in native grass.  (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise stated.)

  A--0 to 13 centimeters (0 to 5 inches); dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) loamy fine sand, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; many fine and very fine and few medium roots; slightly alkaline; strongly effervescent; abrupt smooth boundary.  (10 to 23 centimeters (4 to 9 inches) thick)

  C1--13 to 41 centimeters (5 to 16 inches); light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) fine sand, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; stratified with grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; loose; many fine and very fine and few medium roots; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.

  C2--41 to 76 centimeters (16 to 30 inches); grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; stratified with light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) fine sand, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; many fine and medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; iron masses in matrix; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; common fine and very fine roots; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.

  Cg1--76 to 99 centimeters (30 to 39 inches); pale yellow (2.5Y 8/2) fine sand, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) moist; single grain; loose; common fine and very fine roots; about 3 percent by volume sandstone fragments ranging from 1/10 to 3/4 inch in diameter; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.

  Cg2--99 to 203 centimeters (39 to 80 inches); light gray (2.5Y 7/2) sand, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) moist; single grain, loose; few very fine roots; about 3 percent by volume sandstone fragments ranging from 1/10 to 3/4 inch in diameter; slightly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Cherry County, Nebraska; 1.2 kilometers (3/4 mile) southeast of Crookston; 610 meters (2000 feet) west and 549 meters (1800 feet) north of the southeast corner, sec. 16, T. 34 N., R. 29 W.  USGS Crookston East topographic quadrangle; latitude 42 degrees, 55 minutes, 6 seconds North and longitude 100 degrees, 44 minutes, 11 seconds West.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: moist in some part September to June; intermittently moist from July to September
Depth to carbonates: typically the surface calcareous, the control section is noncalcareous but calcareous throughout allowed
Redoximorphic features: few to many coarse to fine reddish brown, brown, yellowish brown, and yellow iron masses in the soil matrix 41 to 76 centimeters (16 to 30 inches)
Depth to endosaturation: 46 to 91 centimeters (18 to 36 inches)
Thickness of mollic/ochric epipedon: 10 to 24 centimeters (4 to 9.5 inches)

Chroma: 1 to 3
Texture: loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, sand and coarse sand; In some pedons these horizons are stratified layers of silt loam to gravelly coarse sand.  Some pedons contain up to 5 percent by volume sandstone fragments; 2 to 75 mm in size. Pedons also contain rounded, gravel 5 to 15 percent by volume; 2 to 75 mm in size
Reaction: neutral to moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: No competing soil series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: river valleys
Landform: flood plains
Slopes: 0 to 2 percent
Elevation: 610 to 1067 meters (2000 to 3500 feet)
Parent material: recent sandy alluvium
Mean annual temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C. (47 to 52 degrees F.)
Mean annual precipitation: 43 to 61 centimeters (17 to 24 inches)
Frost-free period: 130 to 150 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This are the Almeria, Barney, Calamus and Inavale soils.
Almeria and Barney soils are lower on the landscape and have a seasonal high water table at less than 46 centimeters (1.5 feet).
Calamus soils are higher on the landscape and are coarser textured.
Inavale soils are higher on the landscape and have a seasonal high water table at below 183 centimeters (6 feet).

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage: somewhat poorly drained
Runoff: very low
Saturated hydraulic conductivity:   very high  
Seasonal high water table: 46 to 91 centimeters (1.5 feet to 3 feet).  
Flooding: rarely to occasionally 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in native grasses.
It is used for rangeland or hayland with limited acreage of alfalfa.  
Native grasses are dominantly little bluestem, big bluestem, switchgrass, indiangrass and sedges.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Bolent soils are of moderate extent in western Nebraska and possibly south central South Dakota.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Loup County, Nebraska, 1986.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are: Ochric epipedon: 0 to 13 centimeters (0 to 5 inches) (A horizon)
Aquic conditions: redox features in the matrix below 41 centimeters (16 inches)

Some areas of these soils have been included with Boel soils in the past. A horizons having values less than 5.5 dry and 3.5 moist are less than 7 inches thick.  

OSD Modification 
6/2002 RRZ.  Loam was added to the surface texture; Surface epipedon(Ochric) increased to 9.5 inches;  COS with up to 15 percent gravel by volume added to C horizon; Salinity up to 2mmhos/cc added to surface horizons (capillary fringe)
