BAVIZA SERIES

The Baviza series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in eolian and alluvial sediments. Baviza soils are on fan remnants and fan skirts. Slope ranges from 1 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 72 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, hyperthermic Ustic Torripsamments

TYPICAL PEDON: Baviza loamy fine sand, on a north facing, 2.0 percent slope - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.) 

    A--0 to 3 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine and medium subangular blocky; loose, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (2 to 19 inches thick)

    C1--3 to 29 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; single grain; loose, loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 1 percent igneous gravel; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.

    C2--29 to 47 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; single grain; loose, loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 5 percent distinct white (10YR 8/1), dry, coats of calcium carbonate on rock fragments; 15 percent igneous gravel; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. 

    C3--47 to 80 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; single grain; loose, loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 5 percent distinct coats of calcium carbonate on rock fragments; 17 percent igneous gravel; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline. (Combined thickness of the C horizon is 61 inches or more)

TYPE LOCATION: Presidio County, TX; from the intersection of U.S. Highway 67 and FM 170 north of Presidio, 23.2 miles northwest on FM 170; 135 feet east in rangeland.  USGS topographic quadrangle: Adobes ,TX.  Latitude: 29 degrees, 49 minutes, 39.04 seconds North, Longitude: 104 degrees, 36 minutes, 4.84 seconds West NAD 83.  UTM coordinates: 538516 m E, 3299739 m N, Zone 13. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil Moisture: An Ustic aridic soil moisture regime. The moisture control section is moist for less than 20 days cumulative during July through September. In addition, the moisture control section does not receive significant amounts of precipitation from December through March. 

Mean annual soil temperature: 72 to 78 degrees F.

Particle-size control section (weighted average): 
Clay content: 1 to 12 percent
Sand content: more than 80 percent
Rock fragment content: 0 to 35 percent

A horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR

C2 and C3 horizons
Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR
Value: 4 to 8 dry, 3 to 8 moist

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Baviza soils occur on Holocene-age terraces on fan remnants and fan skirts. Slope ranges from 1 to 8 percent. These soils formed in sandy alluvium or eolian sediments derived from igneous rocks. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 13 inches. Most precipitation occurs as high intensity rain during afternoon thunderstorms from June to September. Precipitation during the months of January, February, and March is less than 13 percent of the annual total. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 68 to 72 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 240 to 280 days.  Elevation is 1,800 to 4,000 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Corazones (TX), Melado (T-TX), and Pantera (TX) series. Corazones soils contain more than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and occur on higher fan remnants. Pantera soils contain more than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and occur on lower flood plains. Melado soils contain more than 35 percent clay content in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Excessively drained. Permeability is very rapid. Runoff is negligible on 1 to 5 percent slopes and very low on 5 to 8 percent slopes. Baviza soils are subject to occasional or rare flooding.  

USE AND VEGETATION: Used as rangeland for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Vegetation zone is desert shrubland. Woody vegetation consists of scattered pricklypear, ocotillo, cholla, soaptree yucca, creosotebush, elbowbush, and whitethorn acacia.  Herbaceous plants include bush muhly, sand dropseed, sixweeks grama, and spurges. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Werst Texas. MLRA 42. The series is of small extent.
