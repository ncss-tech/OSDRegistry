BEAVERFLAT SERIES

The Beaverflat series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium over sand.  These soils are on  alluvial fans and relict stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Beaverflat loam, cropland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 7 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse platy structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 7 inches thick)

    Bt1--7 to 15 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate coarse and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds and in pores; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary.

    Bt2--15 to 30 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds and in pores; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 14 to 27 inches.)

    BC--30 to 34 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; very hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 12 inches thick)

    2C--34 to 60 inches; variegated colored sand; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 10 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8).

COMPETING SERIES:

Attewan (MT) - have a Bk horizon above the 2C horizon; have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the 2C horizon.

Degrand (MT) - have a Bk horizon above the 2C horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - alluvial fans; relict stream terraces.

Elevation - 3,000 to 3,800 feet.

Slope - 0 to 4 percent.

Parent material - alluvium that is 20 to 40 inches deep over sand or loamy sand.

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers.

Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 14 inches.

Mean annual temperature - 41 to 45 degrees F.

Frost-free period - 110 to 135 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability in the A and B horizons and rapid permeability in the 2C horizon.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Beaverflat soils are used mainly for nonirrigated crops.  Potential native vegetation in uncultivated areas is mainly western wheatgrass, needleandthread, prairie sandreed, bluebunch wheatgrass, blue grama, little bluestem, forbs, and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Beaverflat soils are not extensive in southeastern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Carter County, Montana, 1992.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT1136.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from 0 to 15 inches (Ap and Bt1 horizons); an argillic horizon from 7 to 30 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons); and a particle-size control section from 7 to 40 inches (Bt1, Bt2, BC, and 2C horizons).  Beaverflat soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
