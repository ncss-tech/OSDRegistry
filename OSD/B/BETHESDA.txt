DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage Class (Agricultural): Well drained
Internal Free Water Occurrence: None
Flooding Frequency and Duration: None
Ponding Frequency and Duration: None
Index Surface Runoff: Very high
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: Low through moderately high in the upper part, and very low through moderately high in the lower part
Shrink-Swell Potential: Low

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses: Wildlife habitat and recreational areas. The rough topography and coarse fragment content of unreclaimed areas make it impractical for agriculture and difficult for standard forest harvesting practices. Some reclaimed areas are used for hay or pasture, and increasingly, are also used for homesites. Reclaimed areas typically exhibit higher bulk densities, much lower saturated hydraulic conductivities and low organic matter in the surface horizon, making establishment of vegetation difficult.
Dominant Vegetation: Unreclaimed areas are naturally seeded deciduous forests with some barren areas. Reclaimed areas are usually open grassland, including some legumes. A few reclaimed areas have been planted to trees, but mortality is high because of soil compaction.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Distribution: Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia
Extent: Large, about 683,000 acres identified at the time of this revision

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: MORGANTOWN, WEST VIRGINIA

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Belmont County, Ohio, 1978

REMARKS: Bethesda soils were previously mapped as a variety of strip mine spoil and udorthents units.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 13 cm (Ap horizon)
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 200 cm

The 8/2001 revision included numerous changes to most parts of the OSD, including updating to the 8th edition Keys to Soil Taxonomy standards.
The 6/2006 revision updated this series to the 9th edition Keys to Soil Taxonomy standards. Several other changes were made including changes to the COMPETING SERIES and GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS sections.
