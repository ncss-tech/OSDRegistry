BILLYCREEK SERIES

The Billycreek series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy material weathered from sandstone and transported short distances. Billycreek soils are on mountain sides and canyon walls and have slopes of 6 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches. The mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed Lamellic Dystrocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Billycreek loamy fine sand, forested. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    O1--0 to 2 inches; forest duff.

    E--2 to 10 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; very weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, loose; some tongues of dark organic material moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual smooth boundary. (6 to 10 inches thick)

    A&B--10 to 26 inches; (A2) very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; (B2) few lamellae, brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy clay loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, loose; 10 percent small, flat, or angular sandstone fragments; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary. (12 to 30 inches thick)

    R--26 inches; hard, noncalcareous sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION:  Washakie County, Wyoming; about 1,850 feet south and about 300 feet west of NE corner of sec. 13, T.47N., R.87W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. The control section is fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand. Small, flat or angular rock fragments of sandstone range from 0 to 15 percent.

The E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3. It is slightly acid or moderately acid.

The A&B horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR. The lamellae are usually fine and discontinuous, ranging in thickness from 1/16 to 1/4 inch, and the combined thickness is less than 6 inches. The lamellae are sandy loam or sandy clay loam. This horizon is slightly acid or moderately acid.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Bryan series. Bryan soils have a paralithic contact at 40 to 80 inches. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Billycreek soils are on mountainsides and canyon walls. Slopes are 6 to 60 percent. The soils formed in alluvial or colluvial material weathered from sandstone. Elevation is 6,500 to 9,000 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 19 to 25 inches. The mean annual temperature is 37 degrees to 44 degrees F. The mean summer temperature is 54 degrees to 57 degrees F. The frost-free season is less than 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cloud Peak and Wetterhorn soils. Cloud Peak soils have an argillic horizon and are loamy-skeletal. Wetterhorn soils have an argillic horizon and are fine.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; slow to rapid runoff; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for forestry, grazing, recreation, and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is lodgepole pine, Douglas-fir, and pinegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  In the Bighorn Mountains of north-central Wyoming. The series is of small extent.
