BROADAX SERIES

The Broadax series consists of very deep and deep, well drained soils formed in loess on hills. Slopes are 0 to 40 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

(7 to 12 inches thick)

COMPETING SERIES: These are the McKay, Morrow, Nephi, Parleys, and Wannacott, series.

Morrow soils - 20 to 40 inches to lithic contact (basalt)
Nephi soils - hue of 7.5YR or 5YR in Bt horizon; particle-size control section calcareous throughout
Parleys soils - calcic horizon with 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 30 to greater than 60 inches to redox concentrations (well and moderately well drained)
Wannacot soils - 20 to 40 inches to densic contact (glacial till material)

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Broadax soils are on hillslopes and plateaus at elevations of 800 to 3,500 feet. Slopes are 0 to 40 percent. The soils formed in old loess mixed with recent loess in the upper part. Summers are hot and dry and winters are cool and moist. The mean annual precipitation is dominantly 15 to 18 inches: the low precipitation phase ranges to 12 to 16 inches; some areas in eastern Washington and Idaho range to 20 inches. The average July temperature is 69 degrees F. and the average January temperature is 27 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free season is 105 to 170 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Anders, Bagdad, Benge, Calouse, Dragoon, and Reardan soils. Anders soils lack an argillic horizon and are moderately deep to basalt bedrock (lithic contact). Benge soils lack an argillic horizon and are sandy-skeletal in the lower part of the particle-size control section. Bagdad soils are coarse-silty. Calouse soils lack an argillic horizon and have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick. Dragoon soils are underlain by a paralithic contact with granite at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Reardan soils are in a fine family.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderate or moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mostly for cropland but other minor uses include livestock grazing and timber production. Dryland small grains are common crops. Native vegetation is Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, balsamroot, and scattered big sagebrush on the low precipitation phase and ponderosa pine with an understory of Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, common snowberry and rose on the high precipitation phase.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Washington and northern Idaho. MLRA 8. The series is of moderate extent.
