BOOTJACK SERIES

The Bootjack series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. Permeability is moderately slow in the upper part and very    rapid below. They are on terraces, outwash plains, and floodplains and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, nonacid Aeric Cryaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Bootjack silty clay loam, in a nearly level meadow at an elevation of 6,420 feet. (When described on July 26, 1978, this soil was moist to 35 inches and saturated below. Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--1.5 to 0 inches; undecomposed roots from grasses and sedges.

    Ag--0 to 4 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to strong fine granular; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many very fine and fine roots; few fine prominent dark yellowish brown irregularly shaped masses of iron accumulation (10YR 3/6) moist; moderately acid (pH 5.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (3 to 7 inches thick)

    Bg1--4 to 12 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; common fine roots; common fine prominent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) and few fine faint dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist irregularly shaped masses of iron accumulation; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 12 inches thick)

    Bg2--12 to 18 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; common fine roots; many fine and medium prominent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) and common fine faint grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist irregularly shaped masses of iron accumulation; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 10 inches thick)

    Bg3--18 to 23 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; common fine roots; many coarse prominent dark gray (5Y 4/1) moist irregularly shaped masses of iron depletion and many medium prominent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) moist irregularly shaped masses of iron accumulation; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 12 inches thick)

    2C--23 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; single grain; loose; 70 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0).

TYPE LOCATION: Fremont County, Idaho; about 3 1/2 miles northeast of Macks Inn; 990 feet north and 1,980 feet east of the southwest corner of section 9, T.14N., R.44E.

Ag horizon Hue - 10YR or 2.5Y 
Value - 4 through 7 dry, 2 through 5 moist
Chroma - 1 or 2 dry or moist

Chroma - 1 to 3 dry or moist 
Texture - SIL, L, CL, GR-L 
Rock fragments - 0 to 20 percent
Reaction - strongly acid to neutral

2C horizon Hue - 10YR, 2.5Y or variegated 
Value - 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist 
Chroma - 1 or 2 dry or moist 
Texture - ranges from LFS to GRX-COS 
Reaction - moderately acid to neutral

COMPETING SERIES: No other series are currently recognized in this family. Capehorn is in a similar family. It differs by being medial in the upper part of the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bootjack soils are nearly level on terraces, outwash plains, and floodplains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,700 to 7,500 feet. The soil formed in fine textured alluvium in the upper part and gravelly alluvium in the lower part, predominantly from welded rhyolitic tuff, obsidian and diatomaceous sources. The average annual precipitation is about 20 to 30 inches, mostly as snowfall. The average annual air temperature is about 36 to 40 degrees F. The frost-free season is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Fourme, Henryslake, and Sawtelpeak soils. Fourme soils are well drained, have mollic epipedons and lie on adjacent higher terraces. Henryslake soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section. Sawtelpeak soils have more than 35 percent clay in the control section. Both Henryslake and Sawtelpeak soils have mollic epipedons and occur on similar landscapes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained. Slow runoff. Moderately slow permeability in the upper part and very rapid below. These soils are flooded following the spring snowmelt.

USE AND VEGETATION: Bootjack soils are used principally for grazing. The potential natural vegetation is mainly Kentucky bluegrass, timothy, and sedges.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Bootjack soils are of small extent in southeastern Idaho.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Fremont County, Idaho, 1989.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to approximately 4 inches (the Ag horizon).

Cambic horizon - the zone from 4 to 23 inches (the Bg1, Bg2, and Bg3 horizons).

Particle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of the Bg1, the Bg2, Bg3, and part of the 2C horizons)
