BOOTJACK SERIES

The Bootjack series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. Permeability is moderately slow in the upper part and very rapid below. They are on terraces, outwash plains, and floodplains and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 640 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, nonacid Aeric Cryaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Bootjack silty clay loam, in a nearly level meadow at an elevation of about 1960 meters. (When described on July 26, 1978, this soil was moist to 89 cm and saturated below. Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 4 cm; undecomposed roots from grasses and sedges.

    Ag--4 to 14 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to strong fine granular; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many very fine and fine roots; few fine prominent dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/6) moist; irregularly shaped masses of iron accumulation; moderately acid (pH 5.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (10 to 18 cm thick)

    Bg1--14 to 34 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; common fine roots; common fine prominent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) and few fine faint dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist irregularly shaped masses of iron accumulation; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. 

    Bg2--34 to 49 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; common fine roots; many fine and medium prominent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) and common fine faint grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist irregularly shaped masses of iron accumulation; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary.

    Bg3--49 to 62 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; common fine roots; many coarse prominent dark gray (5Y 4/1) moist irregularly shaped masses of iron depletion and many medium prominent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) moist irregularly shaped masses of iron accumulation; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of Bg horizons - 23 to 85 cm)

    2C--62 to 156 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; single grain; loose; 70 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0).

TYPE LOCATION: Fremont County, Idaho; about 6 km northeast of Macks Inn; about 300 meters north and 605 meters east of the southwest corner of section 9, T.14N., R.44E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Mean annual soil temperature--8 to 6 degrees C
Mean summer soil temperature--7 to 9 degrees C (Thin O horizon was not used in determining the soil temperature regime)
Depth to sand and gravel--40 to 100 cm
Depth to high water table--0 to 45 cm

Ag horizon 
Hue--10YR or 2.5Y 
Value--4 through 7 dry, 2 through 5 moist
Chroma--1 or 2 dry or moist 
Reaction--pH 5.1 to 6.5

Bg horizons 
Hue--10YR or 2.5Y 
Value--6 to 8 dry, 4 to 6 moist 
Chroma--1 to 3 dry or moist 
Texture--Silt loam, Loam, clay loam, gravelly loam 
Rock fragment content--0 to 20 percent
Reaction--pH 5.1 to 7.3

2C horizon 
Hue--10YR, 2.5Y or variegated 
Value--6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist 
Chroma--1 or 2 dry or moist 
Texture--loamy fine sand to extremely gravelly coarse sand 
Reaction--pH 5.6 to 7.3

COMPETING SERIES: No other series are currently recognized in this family. Capehorn is in a similar family. It differs by being medial in the upper part of the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform--nearly level on terraces, outwash plains, and floodplains
Elevation--1750 to 2300 meters
Slope--0 to 2 percent
Parent material--fine textured alluvium in the upper part and gravelly alluvium in the lower part, predominantly from welded rhyolitic tuff, obsidian and diatomaceous sources
Mean annual precipitation--510 to 760 mm, mostly as snowfall
Mea annual air temperature--2 to 4 degrees C
Frost-free period--30 to 60 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained. Slow runoff. Moderately slow permeability in the upper part and very rapid below. These soils are flooded following the spring snowmelt.

USE AND VEGETATION: Bootjack soils are used principally for grazing. The potential natural vegetation is mainly Kentucky bluegrass, timothy, and sedges.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Bootjack soils are of small extent in southeastern Idaho. MLRAs 13, 43B

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.
