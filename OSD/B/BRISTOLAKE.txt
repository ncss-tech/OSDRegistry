BRISTOLAKE SERIES

The Bristolake series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granite. Bristolake soils are on fan skirts and fan aprons and have slopes of 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 72 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, hyperthermic Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Bristolake-Carrizo association, 0 to 4 percent slopes at an elevation of 690 feet.  (Colors are for a dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The surface is covered by approximately 50 percent gravel.

    A--0 to 3 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong medium thick platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common very fine and few fine interstitial pores; electrical conductivity 1 dS/m; 10 percent gravel; slightly effervescent (4 percent calcium carbonate); moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick)

    C1--3 to 12 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) stratified very gravelly coarse sand to gravelly sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; moderately hard and slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine, fine and few medium interstitial pores; averages 45 percent gravel; strongly effervescent (4 percent calcium carbonate); strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); abrupt smooth boundary.

    C2--12 to 60 inches;  pale brown (10YR 6/3) stratified sand to very gravelly coarse sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; moderately hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine interstitial to many very fine interstitial pores; electrical conductivity 5 dS/m; sodium adsorption ratio is 8; averages 25 percent gravel; strongly effervescent (4 percent calcium carbonate); strongly alkaline (pH 8.5).

TYPE LOCATION: San Bernardino County, California; about 7 miles southwest of Amboy, California, near the southern margin of the Amboy Crater lava flow; 670 feet south and 2020 feet east of the northwest corner of section 10, T. 4 N., R. 11 E.; 34 degrees, 27 minutes, 16.1 seconds north latitude and 115 degrees, 48 minutes, 50.5 seconds west longitude; Lead Mountain NE quadrangle; UTM 11S, 0608941e 3812990n; NAS-C.

Organic matter: 0 to 0.5 percent.


Particle-size control section - Rock fragments: Averages 15 to 35 percent, ranges from 5 to 55 percent.

Clay content: 1 to 8 percent.


A horizon - Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.

Chroma: 2, 3 or 4 moist.

Calcium carbonate equivalent:  1 to 5 percent.

Electrical conductivity: 0 to 4 dS/m. 

Sodium adsorption ratio: 0 to 4.


C1 horizon - Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR.

Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.

Chroma: 3 or 4.

Textures: Coarse sand through loamy fine sand.

Dry consistence: Soft through moderately hard.

Effervescence: Non-effervescent through strongly effervescent.

Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

Calcium carbonate equivalence: 0 to 5 percent.

Electrical conductivity: 0 to 4 dS/m. 

Sodium adsorption ratio: 0 to 4.


C2 horizon - Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR.

Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.

Chroma: 2, 3 or 4.

Textures: Coarse sand through loamy fine sand.

Structure: Massive or single grained.

Dry consistence: Soft through moderately hard.

Effervescence: Non-effervescent through strongly effervescent.

Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

Calcium carbonate equivalence: 0 to 5 percent.

Electrical conductivity: 4 to 16 dS/m. 

Sodium adsorption ratio: 5 to 12.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bristolake soils are on fan skirts and fan aprons. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. These soils formed in  alluvium derived from granite. Elevations are 600 to 2020 feet. The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 2 to 6 inches; mean annual air temperature is 69 to 74 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 300 to 360 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Carrizo soils. Carrizo soils have sandy-skeletal textural control sections.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; negligible to very low runoff; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Bristolake soils are used for military exercises and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly allscale, fourwing saltbush and creosotebush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave desert of southeastern California, U.S.A.; MLRA 30. These soils are of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: PHOENIX, ARIZONA

SERIES ESTABLISHED: San Bernardino County, California, Marine Corps Air/Ground Combat Center Soil Survey Area, 2000. The name is coined from Bristol Lake.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the profile are:

1. Ochric epipedon -- 0 to 3 inches (A horizon).
2. Particle-size control section -- 10 to 40 inches (Part of the C1 and part of the C2 horizons). 

Responsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 4/2015. The last revision to the series was 6/2000. ET
