BELSAC SERIES

The Belsac series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from siltstone or dolostone influenced by calcareous loess.  The Belsac soils are on mountain side slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Pachic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Belsac very gravelly loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     Bk2--61 to 94 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, few fine and medium roots; few fine tubular pores; thin carbonate coats cover rock fragments with thin carbonate pendants on the underside of rock fragments; 40 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; violently effervescent (10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 38 cm thick)

   Cr--94 cm; fractured siltstone with carbonate coats along fractures with few gypsum crystals.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Baconcamp, Badgerton, Badhap, Behanco, Behanin, Boatman, Boydhollow, Bullrey, Busterback, Caballo, Campone, Croesus, Dressel, Gateview, Goodski, Hapgood, Harcany, Hobacker, Lionhead, Lolon, Marcetta, Mundos, Nagitsy, Namela, Nazaton, Papaspila, Parkcity, Poleline, Povey, Snacreek, Snopoc, Spearhead, Splitbutte, Sweethollow and Tonigut series.  

Baconcamp, Goodski, and Namela soils do not have Bk horizons. Badgerton, Behanco, Behanin, Boatman, Boydhollow, Bullrey, Caballo, Campone, Dressel, Gateview, Hapgood, Harcany, Hobacker, Lolon, Marcetta, Mundos, Nazaton, Parkcity, Poleline, Povey, Snacreek, Snopoc, Spearhead Sweethollow, and Tonigut soils have soil profiles 100 cm or more thick.  Busterback and Papaspila soils are very deep and do not contain calcium carbonate.  Croesus soils have a particle-size control section with less than 18 percent clay and lack Bk horizons with an effervescent matrix.  Nagitsy soils have noncalcareous soils profiles, cambic horizons and are medium acid or slightly acid.  Namela soils do not have Bk horizons.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Belsac soils are on mountain side slopes.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from siltstone or dolostone influenced by calcareous loess.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. Elevations are 1,895 to 2,595 meters.  The climate is cold, continental with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 410 to 460 mm, additional moisture may be derived as a result of snow accumulation through drifting; mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 60 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Amene soils.  Amene soils are shallow to a lithic contact and are carbonatic.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained, medium or rapid runoff, moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, snowberry, serviceberry, Idaho fescue and mountain brome.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeast Nevada.  These soils are not extensive. MLRA 25, 28B.
