BARNETMINE SERIES

The Barnetmine series consists of very shallow and shallow to bedrock, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and/or colluvium derived from granitoid. The Barnetmine soils are on north facing hills. Slopes range from 15 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, nonacid, mesic, shallow Ustic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Barnetmine very cobbly fine sandy loam, on a north facing, 30 percent slope under woodland at an elevation of 1583 meters. (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted. 4/10/2014 actual site observation date.) The soil surface is covered by approximately 10 percent fine gravel, 20 percent medium and coarse gravel, 23 percent cobbles, 8 percent stones, 4 percent boulders.

     A--0 to 6 cm (0 to 2 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) very cobbly fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3), moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots throughout; common very fine irregular pores; 2 percent fine gravel, 6 percent medium and coarse gravel, 20 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 7 cm thick)

     Bw--6 to 20 cm (2 to 8 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) cobbly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4), moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots throughout; common very fine irregular pores; 8 percent fine gravel, 2 percent medium and coarse gravel, 20 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 25 cm thick)

     C--20 to 38 cm (8 to 15 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) very gravelly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4), moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very coarse roots throughout and common very fine roots throughout; common very fine irregular pores; 5 percent fine gravel, 30 percent medium and coarse gravel, 20 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt irregular boundary. (0 to 25 cm thick)

     Cr--38 to 63 cm (15 to 25 inches); weakly coherent granitoid bedrock (fractures 10 to <45 cm apart); weakly coherent. 

TYPE LOCATION: San Bernardino County, California; about 12 miles southeast of Cima, California and 2 miles east-southeast of Government Holes; 500 feet east and 1700 feet south of the northwest corner of section 12, T. 12 N., R. 15 E., San Bernardino Baseline and Meridian; USGS Pinto Valley, California 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; 35 degrees, 8 minutes, 16.20 seconds north latitude and 115 degrees, 19 minutes, 48.90 seconds west longitude; UTM zone 11 652119e, 3889603n, NAD83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil temperature: 12 to 15 degrees C
Depth to paralithic contact: 10 to 50 cm

Control section

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Rooney (CO) series. Rooney soils are formed in sandstone conglomerate and shale, and has a mean annual soil temperature of 10 to 12 degrees F. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Barnetmine soils are on north facing hills. Slopes range from 15 to 60 percent. The soils formed in residuum and/or colluvium derived from granitoid. Elevation ranges from 1400 to 1750 meters. The mean annual precipitation is 175 to 250 mm. The mean annual temperature is about 10 to 13 degrees C. The frost-free period is 180 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cetrepas, Twingold, and Vallegold soils. Cetrepas soils have an argillic horizon. Twingold soils are 100 to 150 cm to a paralithic contact, have a thermic soil temperature regime and an argillic horizon with a coarse-loamy particle-size control section. Vallegold soils have an argillic horizon and a thermic soil temperature regime. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat excessively drained; very high runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity in the upper part and moderately low in the bedrock substratum. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Barnetmine soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is mountain sagebrush and single-leaf pinyon, and big galleta, blackgrama, desert globemallow and desert bitterbrush in burned areas. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Basin and Range of California, U.S.A.; MLRA 30. The series is of small extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California.

SERIES PROPOSED: San Bernardino County, California, Soil Survey of Mojave National Preserve Area, California, 2023. The name is coined from Barnett Mine located in the survey area.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 18 cm. (A and Bw horizons)
Paralithic contact - the zone from 38 to 63 cm. (Cr horizon)
Particle size control section - the zone from 25 to 38 cm. (Part of the Bw and C horizons)
