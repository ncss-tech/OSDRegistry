BEANBLOSSOM SERIES


The Beanblossom series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in 0 to 24 inches of medium-textured alluvium and the underlying loamy-skeletal alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains and alluvial fans. Slope ranges from 1 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1067 millimeters (42 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 11.7 degrees C (53 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, active, mesic Fluventic Dystrudepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Beanblossom channery silt loam on a 1 percent slope in an idle field at an elevation of about 189 meters (620 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

	Ap--0 to 13 centimeters (0 to 5 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; weak fine and medium granular structure; friable; many fine roots; about 10 percent pebbles (mixed lithology but mainly siltstone); strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.

	Bw--13 to 61 centimeters (5 to 24 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silt loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; common very fine and fine roots; about 5 percent pebbles (mixed lithology but mainly siltstone); moderately acid; clear wavy boundary.

	2C1--61 to 122 centimeters (24 to 48 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) extremely channery silt loam; massive; very friable; few fine roots; about 70 percent channers (mixed lithology but mainly siltstone); moderately acid; clear wavy boundary.

	2C2--122 to 137 centimeters (48 to 54 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very channery silt loam; massive; very friable; about 45 percent channers (mixed lithology but mainly siltstone); moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary.

	3Cr--137 to 152 centimeters (54 to 60 inches); moderately cemented siltstone bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION: Jackson County, Indiana; about 6 miles west of Houston; 460 feet south and 430 feet west of the northeast corner of sec. 22, T. 7 N., R. 2 E. USGS Belmont, Ind. Topographic quadrangle; lat. 39 degrees 08 minutes 52 seconds N., and long. 086 degrees 18 minutes 30 seconds W., NAD 27. UTM Zone 16, 561917 easting and 4320491 northing, NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Depth to the base of the cambic horizon: 20 to 34 inches 
Depth to a paralithic contact: 40 to 60 inches 
Particle-size control section averages 10 to 22 percent clay, and 35 to 75 percent rock fragments. 
Size of the rock fragments is dominantly less than 3 inches, but fragments range to 6 inches.  Rock fragments are dominantly pebbles in the solum, and dominantly channers in the substratum. The pebbles are of mixed lithology.  The channers are dominantly strongly or very strongly cemented siltstone and very fine-grained sandstone.
Reaction is moderately acid to neutral in one or more horizons in the 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section.

Ap horizon: 
Hue: 10YR 
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 3 or 4 
Texture: commonly silt loam or loam, and less commonly the gravelly or channery analogues of silt loam or loam
Rock fragment content: 0 to 30 percent 
Reaction: strongly acid to neutral.

A horizon, less than 6 inches thick: 
Hue: 10YR 
Value: 3 or 4
Chroma: 2 or 3 
Texture: commonly silt loam or loam, and less commonly the gravelly or channery analogues of silt loam or loam
Rock fragment content: 0 to 30 percent 
Reaction: strongly acid to neutral.

Bw or 2Bw horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 3 to 6
Texture: commonly silt loam or loam, and less commonly their channery, very channery, gravelly or very gravelly analogues 
Rock fragment content: 5 to 50 percent
Reaction: strongly acid to neutral.

2C horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 3 to 6 
Texture: very channery or extremely channery analogues of silt loam or loam 
Rock fragment content: 35 to 80 percent
Reaction: moderately acid or slightly acid

3Cr horizon:
Weakly or moderately cemented siltstone or shale

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Trestle series. Trestle soils are more than 60 inches to a lithic or paralithic contact. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Beanblossom soils are on flood plains and alluvial fans below steep and very steep
hillslopes. They formed in 0 to 24 inches of medium-textured alluvium and the underlying loamy-skeletal alluvium  Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 millimeters (40 to 46 inches) and mean annual temperature ranges from 11.1 to 13.9 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F). Frost free period is 170 to 200 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cuba, Haymond and Steff soils on flood plains; and the
Brownstown, Gilwood, Gnawbone, Kurtz, Trevlac, Wellrock, and Wrays soils on hills. The well drained Cuba and Haymond soils, and the moderately well drained Steff soils formed in silty alluvium that has less than 10 percent rock fragments in the 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section. Brownstown soils have a lithic contact between 20 and 40 inches. Gilwood, Gnawbone, Kurtz, Trevlac, Wellrock and Wrays soils have an argillic horizon in the series control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. The potential for surface water runoff is very low or low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the medium-textured alluvium (4.23 to 42.34 micrometers/s) and high or very high in the underlying loamy-skeletal alluvium (14.11 to 141.14 micrometers/s). Permeability is moderately rapid or rapid. An intermittent apparent high water table is at a depth of 3.5 to 5 feet from December through April in normal years.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Beanblossom soils are used for hay, pasture or woodland. A few areas are used for cropland. Native vegetation is deciduous forest, dominantly sycamore, elm, hickory, beech, maple, and tulip poplar.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Indiana. Beanblossom soils are of moderate extent in east part of
MLRA 120C.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Brown County, Indiana, 1985.

REMARKS: The Beanblossom soils were included with the Burnside soils in the past, and correlated as nonacid family taxadjuncts. The CEC activity class is estimated based on soils formed in similar parent materials.  The series type location was moved in 2001 to a more representative area of how the soils have been correlated throughout the MLRA. Redoximorphic depletions may or may not be identifiable at 107 centimeters (3.5 feet) or below.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are 1) Ochric epipedon: the zone from 0 to 13 centimeters (0 to 5 inches) (Ap horizon); 2) Cambic horizon: the zone from 13 to 61 centimeters (5 to 24 inches) (Bw1, Bw2 horizons); and 3) Paralithic contact at 137 centimeters (54 inches).

ADDITIONAL DATA; Data for this pedon (S81IN13-5) is published in Station Bulletin No.494, Dept. of Agronomy, Agriculture Experiment Station, Purdue University.
