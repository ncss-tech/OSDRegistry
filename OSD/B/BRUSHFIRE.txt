BRUSHFIRE SERIES

The Brushfire series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in outwash derived from granite. These soils are on outwash terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 1.5 degree C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Brushfire loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A1--0 to 12 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/3) loam, very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2), moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine subangular blocky; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, and common fine and medium roots; many fine interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.

    A2--12 to 27 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/3) loam, very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/3), moist; weak medium subangular blocky; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, and common fine and medium roots; common fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the A1 & A2 horizons -- 18 to 30 cm)

    Bw--27 to 75 cm; strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) very gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4), moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many fine tubular pores; 30 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (40 to 60 cm thick)

    BC--75 to 150 cm; strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) very gravelly sandy loam, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6), moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine subangular blocky; soft, very friable, non-sticky and non-plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2).
