TYPICAL PEDON: Brockatonorton sand on an undulating 1 percent slope in a back dune area of a barrier island. (colors are for moist soil) 

 A--0 to 8 cm (0 to 3 inches); light gray (2.5Y 7/2) sand; single grain; loose; very strongly acid; non-saline; clear wavy boundary. (2.5 to 15 cm thick) 

 C--8 to 61 cm (3 to 24 inches); pale yellow (5Y 7/3) sand; single grain; loose; common  1 to 2 mm (1/32 to 1/16 inch) layers of black (N 2/) sand; very strongly acid; non-saline; abrupt wavy boundary. (48 to 76 cm thick) 

 Cg--61 to 127 cm (24 to 50 inches); gray (5Y 6/1) sand; single grain; loose; very strongly acid; non-saline; clear, wavy boundary. (30 to 61 cm thick). 

 Oe--127 to 152 cm (50 to 60 inches); dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) mucky peat; hemic soil material; fiber content is one-fourth by volume after rubbing; 10 percent soft wood fragments; common medium gray (5Y 5/1) sand lenses evidencing iron depletion; neutral; very slightly saline; abrupt, smooth boundary. (5 to 41 cm thick) 

 C'g--152 to 183 cm (60 to 72 inches); gray (5Y 5/1) sand; single grain; loose; few very fine and fine dead roots; neutral; very slightly saline. 

TYPE LOCATION: Worcester County, Maryland; approximately 2 miles south of the Assateague Island entrance on the park road, 50 feet east of the road in a vegetated back dune area. USGS Tingles Island, MD topographic quadrangle; lat 38 degrees, 13 minutes, 0 seconds N and long. 75 degrees, 9 minutes, 0 seconds W.; NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth to Seasonal High Water Table: 50 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches); throughout the year. The water table may be tidally influenced.
Rock Fragment content: 0 to 5 percent fine gravel, by volume, in the C horizon
Soil Reaction: Moderately acid to mildly alkaline
Salinity: Non-saline to moderately saline throughout

RANGE OF INDIVIDUAL HORIZONS:
A horizon:
Color--hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 through 8, and chroma of 2 through 4. 
Texture (fine-earth fraction)--sand, coarse sand, or fine sand

C horizon: 
Color--hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 8, and chroma of 3 through 6.
Texture (fine-earth fraction)--sand, coarse sand, or fine sand
Redoximorphic features--iron depletions in shades of gray frequently occur

O horizon: 
Color--hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 0 through 2.
Composition--mucky peat with or without thin layers of muck.
Other features--soft wood fragments range from 5 to 50 percent by volume.  

Cg horizon: 
Color--hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.
Texture (fine-earth fraction)--sand or loamy sand.

COMPETING SERIES:
These are the Algansee, Altmar, Birchwood, Brems, Deerfield, Elnora, Fortress, Meckling, Morocco, Ottokee, Partridge, Tedrow, and Zaborosky soils. All of these soils lack a buried organic horizon and are not saline in any part.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: Coastal plain; barrier islands
Landform: Back dune
Parent Material: Sandy eolian and marine sediments
Slope: 0 to 5 percent; gently sloping to undulating
Elevation: Generally less than 6 meters (20 feet) above mean sea level
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 11 to 14 degrees C. (52 to 58 degrees F.).
Mean Annual Precipitation: 965 to 1219 mm (38 to 48 inches).
 
GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Broadkill soils--found within tidal marshes; flooded daily by tidal action
Hooksan soils--excessively drained; found on higher elevations on the dunes
Matunuck soils--found within tidal marshes; flooded daily by tidal action
Pawcatuck soils--consist of organic materials to a depth of at least 40 cm (16 inches); flooded daily by tidal action
Transquaking soils--consist of organic materials to a depth of at least 132 cm (52 inches) flooded daily by tidal action
Westbrook soils--consist of organic materials to a depth of at least 40 cm (16 inches); flooded daily by tidal action

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class (Agricultural): Moderately well drained
Internal Free Water Occurrence: Moderately deep and permanent (present continuously)
Flooding Frequency and Duration: Occasional flooding of very brief duration
Ponding Frequency and Duration: None
Index Surface Runoff: Negligible or very low 
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: High or very high

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses: Most areas are in natural vegetation and used for wildlife habitat. A few areas are cleared and used for recreation purposes such as camp sites.
Dominant Native Vegetation: Includes sea rocket, seaside goldenrod, bayberry, salt myrtle, and shore juniper. Small areas of pine trees occur in some areas. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Distribution: The mid-Atlantic shoreline and coastal barrier islands of Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey.
