BEARBOU SERIES

The Bearbou series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils on low stream terraces and floodplains. They formed in mixed alluvium. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Typic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Bearbou silt loam, pastureland (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) When described on September 16, 2003 the soil was slightly moist to 12 inches, moist to 22 inches and saturated below.

(5 to 7 inches thick)

    Bg2--28 to 36 inches; greenish gray (5GY 6/1) gravelly clay loam, dark greenish gray (5GY 4/1) moist; few fine and medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) and few fine prominent brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) dry redox concentrations; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium and coarse subangular blocky; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - low stream terraces and floodplains.
Elevations - 5,850 to 6,700 feet.
Slope - 0 to 2 percent
Parent material  fine mixed alluvium over coarser alluvium.
Climate - long, cool winters; dry, warm summers
Mean annual precipitation - 14 to 22 inches
Mean annual air temperature - 39 to 43 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 70 to 90 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Blackotter (T), Hades, and Nuffer (T) series. Blackotter soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section and are calcareous in all parts to the soil surface. Hades soils are well drained and have argillic horizons. Nuffer soils have a loamy-skeletal particle size control section and are calcareous in all parts to the soil surface. Blackotter and Nuffer soils are on floodplains and low terraces in positions along the rivers below Bearbou soils. Hades soils are on alluvial fans and terraces along the sides and above Bearbou soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained; slow permeability; slow or very slow runoff; rare flooding for brief periods March through May.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for pastureland.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Bearbou soils are of limited extent in southeastern Idaho. MLRA 47.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Bear Lake County, Idaho, 2008. The name is coined from Bear Lake and Caribou Counties, Idaho.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to 22 inches (the A, Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).
Particle-size control section - the zone from 10 inches to 40 inches (part of the Bw2, the Bkg1, Bkg2, and part of the 2g horizons).
Bearbou soils have a frigid temperature regime and an aquic moisture regime.
