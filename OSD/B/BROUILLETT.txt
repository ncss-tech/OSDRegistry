BROUILLETT SERIES

The Brouillett series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy alluvium on flood plains. These soils have moderately slow permeability. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 inches) and mean annual air temperature is about 11.1 degrees C (52 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquic Cumulic Hapludolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Brouillett silt loam - on a nearly level slope in a pasture at an elevation of about 183 meters (600 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

	Bg1--66 to 86 cm (26 to 34 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common very fine roots; many distinct very dark gray (10YR 3/1) organic coatings on faces of peds; common fine and medium rounded black (10YR 2/1) weakly cemented nodules of iron- manganese oxide throughout; slightly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. 

	Bg2--86 to 107 cm (34 to 42 inches); light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silt loam; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; few very fine roots; few distinct very dark gray (10YR 3/1) organic coatings in root channels; many medium and coarse prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of iron in the matrix; common fine and medium rounded black (10YR 2/1) weakly cemented nodules of iron-manganese oxide throughout; about 2 percent fine gravel; slightly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of Bg horizons is 31 to 61 cm (12 to 24 inches).]

	Cg--107 to 152 cm (42 to 60 inches); light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) stratified silt loam and loam; massive; friable; few very fine roots; many medium and coarse prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of iron in the matrix; common fine and medium rounded black (10YR 2/1) weakly cemented nodules of iron- manganese oxide throughout; about 2 percent fine gravel; slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Brouillett soils are on flood plains commonly adjacent to the stream channel. They are on plane or convex slopes with gradient of less than 2 percent. They formed in dark-colored loamy alluvium primarily in areas of late Wisconsin glaciation. Some pedons contain up to 51 cm (20 inches) of lighter colored overwash. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10.0 to 1.2 degrees C (50 to 54 degrees F). and mean annual precipitation ranges from 890 to 1016 mm (35 to 40 inches0. Frost free period ranges from 170 to 200 days, and elevation ranges from 122 to 274 meters (400 to 900 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Comfrey, Genesee, Landes, Ross, Shoals, and Stonelick soils. The Comfrey soils are poorly drained. The Genesee, Landes, Shoals, and Stonelick soils are not cumulic. Ross soils are better drained and are on slightly higher positions. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium. The saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderately slow. The apparent seasonal high water table is at a depth of 31 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) from January to May at sometime in most years. This soil is frequently or occasionally flooded for brief periods. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used for forage production or for cultivated crops. Native vegetation is thought to be either mixed hardwoods or widely scattered mixed hardwoods and prairie grasses and forbs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 103, 108A, and 111D in northern and central Illinois, Indiana, and Minnesota. Extent is moderate.

Taxonomic classification changed to Aquic Cumulic Hapludolls with 3/99 revision. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
mollic epipedon - the zone form the surface of the soil to a depth of 66 cm (26 inches) (A1, A2, and A3 horizons); cumulic property - mollic epipedon more than 61 cm (24 inches) thick and irregular decrease of organic carbon with increasing depth; 
cambic horizon - the zone from 66 to 107 cm (26 to 42 inches) (Bg1, Bg2 horizons); udic moisture regime; mesic temperature regime.
