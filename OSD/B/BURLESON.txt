BURLESON SERIES

The Burleson series consists of very deep to clayey alluvium, moderately well drained soils that formed in calcareous clayey alluvium of Pleistocene age derived from mixed sources. These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on treads of Pleistocene stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: Calcareous clayey alluvium of Pleistocene age derived from mixed sources.
Landscape:  River valleys and dissected plains

Micro-relief:  This is a cyclic soil and undisturbed areas have gilgai micro-relief with micro-knolls 15 to about 30 cm (6 to 12 in) higher than micro-depressions. Distance between the center of the micro-knoll and the center of the micro-depression is about 1.5 to 4.5 m (5 to 15 ft). The micro-knoll makes up about 20 percent, the intermediate, or area between the knoll and depression, about 50 percent, and the micro-depression about 30 percent.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Branyon, Heiden, Houston Black and Leson series and the Kaufman, Ships, and Wilson series.
Branyon soils: are calcareous in the surface and are on similar positions on stream terraces 
Heiden, Houston Black, and Leson soils: on slightly higher broad ridges on dissected plains
Kaufman and Ships soils: have very-fine control sections, and are on lower flood plains 
Wilson soils: have argillic horizons, and are on similar positions 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage class: Moderately well. 
Permeability class: Very slow. 
Runoff: high on 0 to less than 1 percent slopes, very high on 1 to 5 percent slopes. 
Water enters the soil rapidly when it is dry and cracked, and very slowly when it is moist. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Areas in native rangeland produce little bluestem, big bluestem, Indiangrass, eastern gamma, and switchgrass in excellent condition. Pasture grasses include improved bermudagrass, common bermudagrass, and kleingrass.  Cultivated crops are mainly cotton, sorghum, corn and small grains.
 
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Blackland Prairies and Claypan Area of Texas (MLRAs 86A, 86B, 87A, and 87B). The series is extensive.
