BRODY SERIES

The Brody series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess including volcanic ash and in residuum and colluvium from extrusive igneous rocks.  Brody soils are on mountains and have slopes of 7 to 90 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  The average annual precipitation is about 860 mm and the average annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-skeletal, mixed Typic Vitricryands

TYPICAL PEDON:  Brody cobbly silt loam - forested (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 2 cm; undecomposed needles, leaves, cones, and twigs; very strongly acid (pH 4.5); abrupt broken boundary.  (0 to 3 cm thick)

    Oe--2 to 5 cm; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) partially decomposed needles, leaves, cones, and wood; extremely acid (pH 4.4); abrupt broken boundary.  (0 to 5 cm thick)

    Oa--5 to 6 cm; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) well-decomposed organic matter; strongly acid (pH 5.2 ); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 2 cm thick)

    Bs1--6 to 14 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) cobbly silt loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; moderate very fine and fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; many very fine irregular pores; about 20 percent cobbles and gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.9); gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 13 cm thick)

    Bs2--14 to 39 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) cobbly silt loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak very fine and fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; many very fine irregular pores; about 15 percent cobbles and gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary.  (20 to 38 cm thick)

    Bs3--39 to 82 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely gravelly silt loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure that parts to weak very fine and fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; about 75 percent basalt fragments, mostly angular gravel and cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6 .1); gradual irregular boundary.  (13 to 50 cm thick)

    R--82 cm; basalt bedrock.  Fractured in upper part.

Average annual temperature--2 to 6 degrees C
Frost-free season--less than 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for timber production, recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed.  Vegetation is mainly western redcedar, western white pine, grand fir, western larch, Douglas fir, and Pacific yew with an understory of dogwood, lambstongue, huckleberry, Prince's pine, Paxistima, and twinflower.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Brody soils are moderately extensive in north central Idaho and the surrounding regions; MLRAs 43B and 43C
