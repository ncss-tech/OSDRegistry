BICKERDYKE SERIES

The Bickerdyke series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces and sedimentary plains.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Sodic Haplusterts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bickerdyke clay, native rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    E--0 to 1 inch; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; massive crust; hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 3 inches thick)

   Bss--1 to 8 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure, very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine pores; few faint slickensides; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 10 inches thick)

   Bssy--8 to 14 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure, very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine pores; few faint slickensides; common fine gypsum crystals; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 60 inches thick)

   Bssyz--14 to 22 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure, very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine pores; few faint slickensides; common fine nest and seams of gypsum crystals; few fine seams and nests of other salts; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 40 inches thick)

   Byz--22 to 60 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure, very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine pores; common fine nests and seams of gypsum crystals; few fine seams and nests of other salts; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Carter County, Montana, 1992.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT0449.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon (E and Bss horizons); slickensides from 1 to 22 inches (Bss, Bssy, and Bssyz horizons); a particle size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bssy, Bssyz, and part of Byz horizon).  Bickerdyke soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
