BOLAN SERIES

The Bolan series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy eolian material or alluvial sediments. These soils are on convex slopes on till plains, moraines, dissected till plains and treads and risers on stream terraces in river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 14 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 780 millimeters.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Worth County, Iowa, 1972.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 36 centimeters (Ap and A horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 36 to 115 centimeters (BA, Bw, and BC horizons);
udic moisture regime.

This unit was formerly mapped as Waukegan loam, and subsequently as Saude, Wadena, or Waukee soils.

Type location revisited 8/2009. Location moved slightly due to error with previous locale not in correct delineation.  

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
