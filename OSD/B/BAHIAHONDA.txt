Depth to bedrock: 151 centimeters (60 inches) or greater
Rock and shell fragments: 0 to 60 percent, 2 to 75 mm (less than 3 inches)

Particle-size control section (weighted averages):  
Clay content: 0.1 to 8 percent
Sand content: 85 to 99 percent
Silt content: less than 5 percent

Range of Individual Horizons:
A horizon:
Color: Hue 10YR, value 4 or 5, and chroma 1 to 3
Texture: fine sand or sand 
Rock or shell fragments: 0 to 14 percent

C or Cg horizons:

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landscape: Lower Coastal Plain
Landform(s): Eolian dunes and low ridges above beaches on the Key West Islands and/or along the southern coast of the Florida Peninsula
Parent material: sandy eolian and/or marine deposits over oolitic limestone bedrock
Mean annual temperature: 24 to 27 degrees C (75 to 81 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 1067 to 1778 millimeters (42 to 70 inches)
Frost-free period: 365 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  
Cudjoe soils have marly silt loam particle-sized control section, have bedrock at depths less than 50 centimeters (20 inches), and occur on lower landform positions in the tidal zone.
Islamorada, KeyLargo, and Matecumbe soils are composed entirely of organic materials over oolitic limestone, the depth to bedrock is 50 to 100 centimeters, greater than 150 centimeters, and less than 18 centimeters (7 inches) respectively.  All three soils also occur on lower landform positions in the tidal zone where they are very frequently flooded.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage class: Somewhat poorly drained 
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (KSAT): high to very high
Surface runoff: Negligible to very low
Depth to seasonal high-water table: 45 to 106 centimeters (18 to 42 inches) 
Flooding frequency and duration: subject to flooding from storm surge and hurricanes, rare and brief

USE AND VEGETATION:  
Major uses: wildlife habitat and recreational uses.
Dominant vegetation: poisonwood, crabwood, pigeon plum, toarchwood, stopper, gumbo limbo, Deering's tree cactus, aloe vertie, prickley pear, sea grape, and silver palm.  Some areas have pioneer species dominated by Australian pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  MLRA 156A Florida Everglades and Associated Areas.
