BLACKBEAR SERIES

The Blackbear series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium from mixed rock sources over fine grained igneous or sedimentary residuum. These soils are on mountain slopes and structural benches. Slopes are 4 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 700mm and mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Pachic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Blackbear loam - native rangeland, on an 8 percent slope at 2,134 meters elevation. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 13 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary. 

    A2--13 to 26 cm; dark gray (7.5YR 4/1) cobbly loam, very dark gray (7.5YR 3/1) moist; weak medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 10 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the A horizon is 20 to 50 cm) 

    Bt1--26 to 42 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/3) very cobbly clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 30 percent prominent clay films on faces of peds; 15 percent gravel and 40 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary. (20 to 30 cm thick)

    Bt2--42 to 65 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/3) extremely cobbly clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few fine irregular pores; 15 percent prominent clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles and 15 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. (20 to 30 cm thick)

    R--65 to 152 cm; indurated basalt bedrock.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Slidemountain series.  Slidemountain soils are shallow to a lithic contact and occur on convex slope positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well-drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Blackbear soils are used for rangeland, forestry and wildlife.  Native range vegetation is Idaho fescue, rough fescue, sun sedge, poverty grass, Perry's silene and shrubby cinquefoil.  Forested areas are dominated by an overstory of subalpine fir, Englemann spruce, lodgepole and whitebark pine with an understory of huckleberry, grouse whortleberry, arnica, elk sedge, and pine grass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The Blackbear series is of small extent in central and western Montana.  MLRA 43B.  

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.
