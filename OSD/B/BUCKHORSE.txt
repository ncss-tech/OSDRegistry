BUCKHORSE SERIES

The Buckhorse series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, schist, and granitic sandstone, fanglomerate, and mudstone.  Buckhorse soils are on toeslopes of eroded fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Buckhorse soils are on toeslopes of erosional fan remnants.  They formed in alluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist, and from Tertiary granitic sandstone, fanglomerate, and mudstone.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,700 to 7,900 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 15 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Altazano, Encantado, and Tanoan soils.  Altazano soils are coarse-loamy, have stratified alluvial mantles, and occur on adjacent, frequently flooded inset fans.  Encantado soils are sandy-skeletal, have calcic horizons, and occur on shoulders and backslopes of erosional fan remnants.  Tanoan soils are coarse-loamy, have ochric epipedons and calcic horizons, and occur on shoulders and footslopes of erosional fan remnants.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium surface runoff; moderately rapid permeability in the subsoil and in the upper part of the substratum, and moderately rapid or rapid permeability in the lower part of the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Buckhorse soils are used for urban development, livestock grazing, and recreation.  The historic climax vegetation is blue grama, galleta, ring muhly, black grama, and broom snakeweed.  The ecological site is Loamy(R036XB112NM). 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Buckhorse soils are of small extent on the southeastern Espanola Basin part of the Basin and Range province in northcentral New Mexico.  The MLRA is 36.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Santa Fe County, New Mexico; Santa Fe Area Soil Survey Update; 2008.  Buckhorse is a coined name derived from the name Buckman, its region of origin. This series was originally proposed as Buckmen in 1996, and changed to Buckhorse in 2006.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 11 inches. (A and Bt horizons)

Argillic horizon - The zone from 4 to about 37 inches. (Bt, Btk1, and Btk2 horizons)

Calcic horizon - The zone from 11 to about 49 inches. (Btk1, Btk2, and Bk horizons)

ADDITIONAL DATA:  The series type location has been sampled for the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S94NM-049-001.  Reference analyses such as particle-size distribution, organic carbon content, and cation exchange capacity were performed.
