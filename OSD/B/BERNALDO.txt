BERNALDO SERIES

The Bernaldo series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvial deposits. These nearly level to moderately sloping soils are on stream terraces. Slope is 0 to 8 percent but is are dominantly less than 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C (65 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1168 mm (46 in). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Glossic Paleudalfs

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the closely related Attoyac, Besner, and Freestone series, and the Mollville, Gallime, and Woden, series. 
Attoyac, soils: are on higher landscape positions and have deeper water tables.
Besner soils: are on closely associated mounds and convex areas. 
Freestone soils: are on higher landscape positions. 
Gallime soils: have a thicker surface and are on a slightly higher position.  
Mollville soils: are in depressions, have intrusions of albic material in the upper B horizon, and have gray colors near the surface. 
Woden soils: are on similar terraces and have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderate. Runoff on 0 to 1 percent slopes is negligible, 1 to 5 percent is low, and 5 to 8 percent is medium. A perched water table is below a depth of 122 to 183 cm (4 to 6 ft) during the winter and spring seasons in normal years. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Principal use is woodland with dominant species of pine such as loblolly and shortleaf and many oak species and other southern hardwoods. Some areas are in pasture. Pastures are mainly in improved or common bermudagrass, bahiagrass, overseeded with legumes of crimson and arrowleaf clovers, vetch or singletary peas. Small areas are farmed to corn, small grains for grazing, sorghum for grazing and hay, and truck crops. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Coastal Plains of Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana (LRR P; 
MLRA 133B, MLRA 87A and MLRA 86B). The series is of moderate extent.
