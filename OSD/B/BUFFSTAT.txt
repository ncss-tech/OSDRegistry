SERIES ESTABLISHED: Nelson County, Virginia, 1988. 

REMARKS: Buffstat soils were previously mapped as Nason, a thermic counterpart. 

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 4 inches (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 4 to 42 inches (Bt horizons)
Paralithic contact-42 inches
Lithic contact-58 inches
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 52 inches 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Ranges for morphology, chemistry, particle-size distribution, and mineralogy are based on 2 pedons and the thermic counterpart to this soil
