BORDA SERIES

The Borda series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from volcanic rocks.  Borda soils are on hills.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Vertic Paleargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Borda gravelly sandy loam, rangeland. A pavement of gravel and stones covers 50 percent of the surface. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 8 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; slightly acid (pH 6.3); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 cm thick)

    A2--8 to 25 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/2) gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; few fine and many very fine roots; many very fine interstitial and tubular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.3); abrupt wavy boundary.  (8 to 18 cm thick)

    Bt--25 to 61 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; strong medium prismatic structure; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; prominent continuous clay films in pores and as bridges; many slickensides; neutral (pH 7.0); clear slightly wavy boundary.  (25 to 43 cm thick)

    Btk--61 to 86 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist, few fine and medium distinct reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8) mottles; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots in the upper part; common very fine interstitial and tubular pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds and in pores; common fine and medium distinct very pale brown (10YR 8/2) soft masses of carbonate on faces of peds and undecomposed rock fragments, or as fine concretions; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary.  (25 to 43 cm thick)

    Bk--86 to 127 cm; variegated 40 percent very pale brown (10YR 7/3), 40 percent light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) and 20 percent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), yellowish brown (10YR 5/6), and strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) moist; massive; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular and many very fine interstitial pores; strongly effervescent; few fine soft carbonate nodules in pockets and in cracks; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (25 to 50 cm thick)

   R--127 cm; hard fractured andesite.

Calcium carbonate: 1 to 5 percent.
Effervescence:  Slightly effervescent through strongly effervescent.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are Campo, Gooding, Mahala, Phing, Sorf, Twickenham, and Verdigo series.  

Campo soils have an ustic moisture regime.  Gooding soils have a duripan at 100 to 150 cm.  Mahala, Sorf, and Verdigo soils have bedrock at less than 100 cm.  Phing soils are very deep and have an albic horizon (E horizon).  Twickenham soils are very deep and have greater than 10 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Borda soils are on foothills and hills at elevations of 1,554 to 2,134 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  The soils formed in residuum weathered from volcanic rocks.  The annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C; mean annual precipitation is 250 to 400 mm; and the frost-free season is 90 to l30 days.  

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Aldax and Millich soils.  Aldax soils lack an argillic horizon and have bedrock within 50 cm.   Millich soils have bedrock within 50 cm.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; slow permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, bitterbrush, squirreltail, needlegrass, bluegrass, cheatgrass, and buckwheat, with pinyon pine encroaching in some areas.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada and east-central California.  These soils are of moderate extent. MLRA 26.
