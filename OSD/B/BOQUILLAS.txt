BOQUILLAS SERIES

The Boquillas series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed from pyroclastic rock.  Boquillas soils are on plateaus and mesas and have slopes of 1 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Aridic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Boquillas gravelly loam - grazeable woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(6 to 10 inches thick)

    2Bt2--12 to 19 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) gravelly clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; strong medium and coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate very fine and fine subangular blocky; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine, few fine and coarse roots; few very fine interstitial pores; 15 percent hard gravel; few faint clay films on faces of peds; common pressure faces; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 8 inches thick)

    2Bt3--19 to 23 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) gravelly clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; strong medium and coarse prismatic structure parting to strong medium subangular blocky; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine, fine and coarse roots; few very fine interstitial pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 25 percent gravel; common pressure faces; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 4 inches thick)

    3Bk--23 to 38 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) very gravelly clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; massive; very hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few fine and medium roots; 40 percent gravel and 10 percent cobble, calcium carbonate coated; many soft calcium carbonate masses; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (2 to 16 inches thick)

    4Cr--38 inches; hard siliceous tuff; can be dug with a spade after soaking with water.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bethune (CO), Blackpipe (SD), Boneek (SD), Chapin (CO), Collbran (CO), Collide (CO), Emigrant (WY), Huggins (SD), Kube (SD), Leyden (CO), Loma (CO), Nuncho (WY), Nunn (CO), Querc (WY), Raku (CO), Rednun (CO), Richfield (KS), Ryus (KS), Savo (SD), Showlow (AZ), Standley (CO), Thunderbird (AZ), Weld (CO) and Wormser (CO) series.  Chapin and Thunderbird soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Boneek, Collbran, Collide, Kube, Loma, Nuncho, Nunn, Querc, Raku, Rednun, Richfield, Savo, Showlow, Sofia, Standley, and Weld soils do not have bedrock at depths less than 40 inches.  Chapin and Wormser soils formed from sandstone and in addition, Bethune, Wormser and Leyden soils have hue of 10YR or yellower.  Ryus soils are calcareous throughout.  Blackpipe, Emigrant and Huggins soils are moist in the soil moisture control section during May and June.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Boquillas soils are on plateaus and mesas at elevations of 5,800 to 6,300 feet.  They formed in alluvium from basaltic, pumiceous, and siliceous tuff; rhyodacite, dacite, and rhyolite.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period ranges is 120 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cabezon, Faraway, Lynx, Seligman and Springerville soils and the competing Ashfork and Thunderbird soils.  Cabezon, Faraway and Seligman soils have a lithic or paralithic contact at depths less than 20 inches.  Faraway, Lynx, and Springerville soils do not have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff;  slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Boquillas soils are used for livestock grazing, fuelwood production and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation is mainly oneseed juniper, blue grama, sideoats grama, sand dropseed, bottlebrush squirrel tail, algerita, and broom snakeweed.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North central Arizona.  The series is not extensive. MLRA 39.
