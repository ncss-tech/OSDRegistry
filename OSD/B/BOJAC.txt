TYPE LOCATION: Greensville County, Virginia; about 1.34 miles west southwest (250 degrees) of the junction of VA-625 and VA-622 and about 0.47 miles south of VA-625.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Solum Thickness: 30 to 65 inches
Depth to Bedrock: Greater than 60 inches
Depth to Seasonal High Water Table: 48 to 72 inches, November to April
Soil Reaction: extremely acid to slightly acid except where the surface has been limed 
Gravel Content: Quartz gravel make up 0 to 5 percent of the solum and 0 to 15 percent of the C horizon in the non-flooded phase; 0 to 35 percent in the solum and 0 to 50 percent of the C horizon in the flooded phase 

A or Ap horizon:
Color--hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Where the value is 3 and the chroma is 1 or 2, the A horizon is less than 6 inches thick. Texture--loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam

Redoximorphic features--iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less are in some pedons below a depth of 40 inches.

BC or CB horizon (if it occurs)
Color--hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8
