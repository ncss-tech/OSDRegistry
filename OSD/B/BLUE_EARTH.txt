BLUE EARTH SERIES

The Blue Earth series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in 75 to more than 200 centimeters of coprogenous earth and the underlying loamy till, lacustrine sediments, or outwash of Late Wisconsin glaciation. These soils are on plane or slightly concave slopes in former lake basins in moraines, flood plains, and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 735 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Mollic Fluvaquents 

TYPICAL PEDON: Blue Earth mucky silty clay loam, on a plane level slope in the bottom of a former postglacial lake, in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    Ap--0 to 25 centimeters; black (10YR 2/1) mucky silty clay loam (coprogenous earth), dark gray (5Y 4/1) dry; weak fine granular structure; very friable; few snail shells and fragments of snail shells; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (20 to 30 centimeters thick)

    Cg--25 to 173 centimeters; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) mucky silty clay loam (coprogenous earth), very dark gray (5Y 3/1) clay loam, and dark olive gray (5Y 3/2) clay loam; massive with distinct bedding planes; very friable; few fine prominent dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) and few fine dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) redoximorphic concentrations; few to many snail shells in different parts; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline. 

    2Cg1--173 to 183 centimeters; dark olive gray (5Y 3/2) clay loam; massive; friable; few snail shells; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. 

    2Cg2--183 to 203 centimeters; very dark gray (5Y 3/1) clay loam; massive; friable; common snail shells; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

Slacwater--do not have coprogenous earth in the series control section
Uturin--do not have coprogenous earth in the series control section and have a clay content of 35 to 46 percent in the lower third of the series control section

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--75 to more than 200 centimeters of coprogenous earth and the underlying loamy till, lacustrine sediments, or outwash of Late Wisconsin glaciation

Elevation--300 to 400 meters above sea level
Mean annual air temperature--6 to 10 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation--585 to 890 millimeters
Frost-free period--155 to 200 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Clarion, Crippin, Lemond, Linder, and Nicollet soils.
Clarion--are on higher landscape positions on convex slopes, have a frequently saturated zone between depths of 1.2 and 1.8 meters during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation, and have a sand content that averages 30 to 50 percent in the particle-size control section
Crippin--are on higher landscape positions on slightly convex slopes, have a frequently saturated zone between depths of 0.3 and 1 meter during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation, and have a sand content that averages 20 to 35 percent in the particle-size control section
Lemond--are on slightly higher landscape positions on rims of depressions and have a clay content that averages less than 18 percent in the particle-size control section
Linder--are on higher landscape positions on slightly convex slopes, have a frequently saturated zone between depths of 0.3 and 1 meter during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation, and have a rock fragment content of 5 to 30 percent in the lower third of the series control section
Nicollet--are on higher landscape positions on slightly convex slopes, have a frequently saturated zone between depths of 0.3 and 1 meter during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation, and have a sand content that averages 20 to 35 percent in the particle-size control section

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage--very poorly drained--in undrained conditions, a frequently saturated zone occurs at the surface to a depth of 0.3 meter during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--0.10 to 10.00 micrometers per second in the coprogenous earth and 1.00 to 10.00 micrometers per second in the underlying material, 0.01 to 0.10 micrometers per second in the underlying materials in the firm till phase, and 100.00 to 705.00 micrometers per second in the sandy substratum phase
Ponding--frequently ponded up to 1 meter above the surface for long duration

Areas that are drained have variable depths to saturation based on the effectiveness of the drainage network

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are cultivated. The principal crops are corn and soybeans. Some areas are used for pasture or hay. Invasive vegetation (after drainage) is mostly sedges, reeds, and grasses. The soils do not have a history of native vegetation in the conventional sense because these soils were, until recently, sediments in the bottom of lakes. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Physiographic Division--Interior Plains
Physiographic Province--Central Lowland
Physiographic section--Western lake section
MLRA--Central Iowa and Minnesota Till Prairies (103)
LRR M; west-central and central Minnesota and north-central Iowa
Extent--moderate

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota; MLRA SSO 10-5 (Albert Lea, Minnesota)

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Rock County, Minnesota, 1945. 

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
mollic subgroup based on the zone from the surface to a depth of 25 centimeters (Ap horizon), underlain by stratified materials;
aquic moisture regime.

In the past some sloping fens were included in the concept of Blue Earth. Blue Earth is being restricted to ponded basins and lake beds of the Holocene epoch.

Problems remain in the classification of these series because no taxon has been defined in Soil Taxonomy that adequately accommodates soils that have formed entirely in coprogenous earth.

A firm till substratum phase with a moist bulk density range from 1.65 to 1.75 g/cc is recognized in MLRA 103 on the Coteau Slope (bench) physiographic area.

Cation-exchange class is inferred from lab data for similar soils in the surrounding area.
