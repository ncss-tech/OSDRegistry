BOELUS SERIES

The Boelus series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in eolian sand deposited over loess.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is rapid in the sandy part and moderate in the silty part.  These soils are on uplands and stream terraces and have slopes ranging from 0 to 11 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 660 millimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy over loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Udic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Boelus loamy fine sand with a slope of about 4 percent in rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

   A--0 to 28 centimeters; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loamy fine sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. (25 to 50 centimeters thick)

   Bw1--28 to 61 centimeters; brown (10YR 5/3) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse angular blocky structure; soft, very friable; slightly acid; abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 50 centimeters thick)

   2Bw2--61 to 102 centimeters; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, friable; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (20 to 38 centimeters thick)

   2Bw3--102 to 127 centimeters; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silty clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, friable; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 30 centimeters thick)

   2C--127 to 152 centimeters; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silt loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; few fine faint brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) moist relict redoximorphic concentrations; massive; slightly hard, very friable; neutral.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Hadar series in the same family.
Hadar soils have 2B and 2C horizons of loamy glacial till.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent materials - eolian sand deposited over loess
Landscape - upland
Landform - stream terrace
Slope - 0 to 11 percent
Mean annual air temperature - 8 to 11 degrees C,
Mean annual precipitation - 560 to 730 millimeters

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Libory, Loretto, and Thurman soils; and the Dunn, Kenesaw, Moody, Nora, Ortello, and Valentine soils.
Libory soils are lower in the landscape and have redoximorphic concentrations in the 2B and 2C horizons.
Loretto soils are on similar landscapes and have an argillic horizon.
Thurman soils are higher in the landscape and are in the sandy family.
Dunn soils are lower in the landscape and are sandy over clayey.
Kenesaw soils are above Boelus soils in the landscape and are coarse-silty.
Moody and Nora soils are higher in the landscape and are fine-silty.
Ortello soils are on similar landscapes and are coarse-loamy.
Valentine soils are generally above Boelus soils in the landscape, lack a mollic epipedon, and are sandy (in the Psamments suborder).

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class  There are no redoximorphic features within 183 centimeters indicative of contemporary saturation or aquic conditions (well drained).
Saturated hydraulic conductivity - rapid in the sandy part and moderate in the silty part.
Runoff - slow or medium.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of the acreage of this soil is cultivated and some areas are irrigated.  Corn, grain sorghum, winter wheat, and alfalfa are the major crops.  Where in native vegetation, the principal species are sand blue-stem, little bluestem, prairie sandreed, needleandthread, blue grama, and side-oats grama.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Physiographic Division - Interior Plains
Physiographic Province - Central Lowland
Physiographic Section - Dissected Till Plains
Land Resource Regions - Western Great Plains Range and Irrigated Region (LRR G), Central Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range Region (LRR H), and Central Feed Grains and Livestock Region (LRR M).

The series is of moderate extent.
