BENFIELD SERIES

The Benfield series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in pedisediment over residuum weathered from shales. Benfield soils are on hillslopes on uplands in Bluestem Hills, MLRA 76. Slopes range from 3 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 935 millimeters (37 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F), at the type location.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform: hillslopes on uplands
Slopes: 3 to 35 percent
Elevation: 300 to 505 meters (980 to 1650 feet)
Mean annual air temperature: 12 to 14 degrees C (53 to 58 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 810 to 1060 millimeters (32 to 42 inches)
Precipitation pattern: Precipitation is usually evenly distributed throughout the year with the exception of November through February being the driest months and May and June being the wettest months. Summer precipitation occurs during intense summer thunderstorms.
Frost-free period: 160 to 200 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Clime, Florence, Labette, and Tully soils. Clime soils do not have an argillic horizon. They are on similar topographic positions as Benfield soils. 
The deep, clayey-skeletal Florence soils are generally above or below the Benfield soils. 
Labette soils are less sloping and are usually on higher topographic positions. The deep Tully soils are formed from alluvium or colluvium and are on foot slopes below the Benfield soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage: well
Runoff: high to very high 
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: moderately low

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used for rangeland with some gentler slopes cultivated to wheat or grain sorghum. Native vegetation is tall prairie grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Dominantly in the Bluestem Hills of Kansas with minor areas in southern Nebraska and central Kansas; Land Resource Region H; Central Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range Region, MLRA 74, Central Kansas Sandstone Hills; MLRA 75, Central Loess Plains, MLRA 76, Bluestem Hills; Land Resource Region M; Central Feed Grains and Livestock Region, MLRA 106 Nebraska and Kansas Loess-Drift Hills; MLRA 107B, Iowa and Missouri Deep Loess Hills.

02/2003 The type location was redescribed in March 2000. Classification changed from udic argiustolls to udertic argiustolls based on laboratory samples.

02/2016 BKN Updated intro to current standards. Added in metric units. Added clay content, sand content, and fragments to RIC. East facing, convex, 27 percent slope, and elevation of 400 meters was added to the typical pedon. Added quadrangle, latitude, longitude, and datum to type location. Changed geographic setting to tabular and added in landform, slope, elevation, precipitation pattern, MAAT, MAP, and FFD to geographic setting. Deleted competing series. Updated geographically associated soils by deleting Irwin, Kipson, and Sogn. Changed permeability to Ksat. Added LRRs and MLRAs to distribution and extent. Added particle-size control section and secondary carbonates to remarks. Added lab data to additional data.  

06/2020 BKN Added RIC for Btk horizon.
