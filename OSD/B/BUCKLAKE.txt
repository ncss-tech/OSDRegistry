BUCKLAKE SERIES

The Bucklake series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from basalt or andesite.  Bucklake soils are on plateaus and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, smectitic, mesic Aridic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bucklake very stony loam--on a 38 percent southeast-facing slope under Wyoming big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Thurber's needlegrass at 1600 meters elevation--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described April 10, 1979, the soil was moist throughout.)  The surface is covered with 20 percent stones, 15 percent cobbles, and 10 percent gravel.

    Bt2--30 to 46 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) gravelly clay, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; 25 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear wavy boundary.

    Bt3--46 to 61 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) gravelly clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; weak medium and coarse angular blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; 25 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear wavy boundary.  (The combined thickness of the Bt2 and Bt3 horizons is 25 to 70 cm)

    R--61 cm; hard basalt with some fractures.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lassen County, California; about 2.2 miles north-northwest of Smoke Creek Reservoir; approximately 1,000 feet north and 700 feet east of the approximate center of section 2, T. 32 N., R. 17 E.; USGS Al Shinn Canyon 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 40 minutes 02 seconds N and longitude 120 degrees 1 minutes 01 seconds W; NAD 83.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Brownscombe, Cagle, Correco, Holmzie, Jasseek, Northmore, Perla, Schoer, Sherar, Wicup, and Zymans series.

Brownscombe soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts and have more than 15 percent coarse and very coarse sand in the particle-size control section. Cagle, Holmzie, Sherar, and Wicup soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Correco, Jasseek, Northmore, and Schoer soils are very deep.  Perla soils have more than 35 percent clay in all subhorizons of the particle-size control section and are dry for shorter consecutive periods between July and November.  Zymans soils are greater than 100 cm deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bucklake soils are on plateaus and mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks such as basalt and andesite.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevation ranges from 1,000 to 2,400 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 230 to 310 mm and annual snowfall totals 500 to 1,020 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C., mean January temperature is -3 to 0 degrees C., and mean July temperature is 17 to 19 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 50 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Corral, Devada, and Petescreek soils.  Corral soils are loamy, shallow to paralithic contacts, and have ochric epipedons.  Devada soils are shallow to lithic contacts.  Petescreek soils are fine-loamy, moderately deep to paralithic contacts, have thick mollic epipedons, and do not have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high surface runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Bucklake soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Thurber's needlegrass, and scattered western juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern California, northwestern Nevada, and south-central Oregon.  These soils are extensive with about 147,000 acres of the series mapped to date.  The series concept and main acreage is in MLRA 23, while other acreage occurs in MLRAs 10, 21, 26, and 27.
