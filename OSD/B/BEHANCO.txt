BEHANCO SERIES

The Behanco series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and slope alluvium derived dominantly from sandstone.  Behanco soils are on mesas.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Pachic Haplocryolls

    2Cr--47 to 59 inches;  yellow (10YR 7/6) weathered sandstone, brownish yellow ( 10YR 6/6) moist; massive; extremely hard, extremely firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; strongly acid (pH 5.1); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 12 inches thick)

    2R--59 inches;  hard Dakota sandstone.
