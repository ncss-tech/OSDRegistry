BEWEARZE SERIES

The Bewearze series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from lacustrine sediments.  These soils are on fan remnants and have slopes of 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, thermic Ustic Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON: Bewearze silt loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many medium and common fine roots; common fine and medium tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 5 inches thick)

    Bw--3 to 14 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silt loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic parting to weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many medium and common fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 15 inches thick)

    C1--14 to 27 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silt loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many medium and common fine roots; common fine and coarse tubular pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 14 inches thick)

    C2--27 to 35 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) coarse sandy loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and medium roots; few fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 9 inches thick)

    C3--35 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silt loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; few fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bewearze soils are on fan remnants and have slopes of 2 to 8 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium from lacustrine sediments of the Verde Formation.  Elevations range from 3000 to 4000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 14 inches.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 60 to 63 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 220 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hatranch, Ryallen, Bodecker, and Guest soils.  The Hatranch soils are shallow to gypsiferous lacustrine sediments.  The Ryallen soils are clayey-skeletal, the Bodecker soils are sandy-skeletal and the Guest soils are fine.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Bewearze soils are used for urban development and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mesquite, alkali sacaton, threeawn, canotia and rabbitbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Arizona.  Bewearze soils are of small extent.  MLRA is 38.
