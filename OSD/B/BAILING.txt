BAILING SERIES

The Bailing series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils.  They formed in loess and silty alluvium. Bailing soils are in concave positions on basalt plains and have slopes of 1 to 8 percent.  Permeability is very slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Abruptic Haplic Durixeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bailing silt loam -  at an elevation of 4,490 feet in a slightly concave position on a 4 percent west facing slope in rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(1 to 4 inches thick)

    A2--2 to 8 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; about 5 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.3); clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 8 inches thick)

    E--8 to 10 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine and few medium roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; about 5 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.3); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick)

    Btb--10 to 22 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium columnar structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine and fine roots matted on ped faces; few very fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and in pores; common uncoated sand and silt particles on  faces of peds; neutral (pH 7.3); gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 16 inches thick)

    Btkb1--22 to 30 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; strong medium and coarse prismatic structure; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; common prominent clay films on faces of peds and in pores; slightly effervescent on faces of peds (about 5 percent calcium carbonate); mildly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 14 inches thick)

    Btkb2--30 to 39 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine prismatic structure parting to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky; extremely hard, very firm, sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds and in pores; strongly effervescent on faces of peds (about 15 percent calcium carbonate); mildly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 10 inches thick)

    Bkqmb--39 to 60 inches; pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) weakly cemented duripan; continuous silica cap less than 1mm thick at 39 inches; material between caps is weekly cemented; violently effervescent (about 30 percent calcium carbonate).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series listed in the same family.  The closely related Bray series has an indurated duripan and does not have a calcic horizon above the duripan.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bailing soils are in concave positions on basalt plains and have slopes of 1 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 4,250 to 5,000 feet.  The soil formed in loess and silty alluvium.  The soils are in a semiarid climate with annual precipitation of 11 to 13 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 45 to 48 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 85 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Darrah, Hamrub, Perla, and Ruckles.  The Darrah soils are fine-silty and are very deep.  Hamrub soils are fine-silty and have a Calcic horizon.  Perla soils are moderately deep.  Ruckles soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to basalt.  These soils are also on basalt plains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, medium runoff; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for rangeland.  Vegetation is three-tip  sagebrush, Sandberg bluegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, threeawn, balsamroot, mustard, and phlox.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South central Idaho.  The series is not extensive.
