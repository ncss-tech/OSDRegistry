BRIMSON SERIES

The Brimson series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in a friable loamy mantle and the underlying dense loamy Rainy Lobe till on drumlins and moraines.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Gnesen, Hermantown, Kenduskeag(T), and Pequaywan series.
Gnesen--have coarse textured outwash in the lower third of the series control section
Pequaywan--have coarse textured outwash in the lower third of the series control section and have saturation no shallower than 75 centimeters below the surface
Hermantown--are underlain by dense Superior Lobe till with 2.5YR or 5YR hue
Kenduskeag(T)--have sola terminated by phyllite, calcareous metasiltstone and pelitic limestone

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--a friable loamy mantle and the underlying dense, firm and very firm, loamy Rainy Lobe till
Landform--on plane and slightly convex slopes on back slopes and summits of drumlins and moraines
Slope--0 to 8 percent
Mean annual air temperature--2 to 4 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation--635 to 760 millimeters
Annual freeze free period--120 to 175 days
Elevation above sea level--185 to 640 meters

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Near the type location, these are the Bugcreek, Nevens, and Toimi soils.
Bugcreek--are in drainageways and depressions or on the edges of bogs and swamps and are in the Typic Humaquepts subgroup
Nevens--are on lower lying or less sloping positions on the landscape and are in the Typic Epiaquepts subgroup
Toimi--are on higher lying or more sloping positions on the landscape and are in the Oxyaquic Eutrudepts subgroup

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--somewhat poorly drained--The Brimson soils have perched seasonal high saturation at depths as high as 15 centimeters below the surface during the spring in normal years.  At the contact between the loamy mantle and dense till, there commonly is a concentration of redoximorphic features that has shallow penetration into the dense till along fractures and rock sockets.
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--1.00 to 10.00 micrometers per second (moderately high) in the loamy mantle and 0.01 to 0.10 micrometers per second (low) in the underlying dense till

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for timber production. Native vegetation was mixed deciduous and coniferous forest. Major tree species are quaking aspen, paper birch and balsam fir.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 13 centimeters (A horizon);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 13 to 89 centimeters (Bw horizons);
aquic moisture condition based on the redoximorphic depletions within 60 centimeters of the mineral soil surface;
dystric subgroup based on no free carbonates above 100 centimeters;
isotic mineralogy based on 1500 kPa water to measured clay ratio of 0.6 or greater.

The previous classification was coarse-loamy, mixed, nonacid, frigid Aeric Epiaquepts.

The designation of the 2BCd horizon is based on fractures and platy structure in the densic material.  Clay and silt translocation can be seen between the horizontal plates when broken apart.
