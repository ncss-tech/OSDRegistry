BELVUE SERIES

 The Belvue series consists of very deep, well-drained soils. They formed in silty alluvium on the flood-plain steps. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 36 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, nonacid, mesic Typic Udifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Belvue silt loam- in a cultivated field. (Colors are dry soil unless otherwise stated)

 Ap--0 to 6 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 6 inches)

 C1--6 to 11 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.

 C2--11 to 24 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very fine sandy loam stratified with lenses of fine sand, light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. 

 C3--24 to 39 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) dry; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.

 C4--39 to 58 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very fine sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. 

 C5--58 to 80 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, very pale brown (10YR 8/3) dry; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Pottawatomie County, Kansas; about 2 1/2 mile east and 1 mile south of Belvue; 50 feet south and 1100 feet west of the northeast corner of section 12, T. 10 S., R. 11 E. USGS Belvue Topographic Quadrangle lat. 39 degrees 12 minutes 7 seconds N. and long. 96 degrees 7 minutes 54 seconds W.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Arenzville, Chaseburg, Hadley, Juneau, and Zeandale series. These soils do not have calcium carbonates within 60 inches. 
The Arenzville soils have buried Ab horizon at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. 
The Chaseburg soil has mean annual temperature of 43 to 52 degrees F. 
The Hadley soil has mean annual temperature of 45 to 50 degrees F. 
The Juneau soil has a buried B horizon and formed in colluvium. 
The Zeandale soil has carbonates above 20 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: These soils derived from silty alluvium
Landform:  floodplain step and escarpment
Flooding: occasional to rare
Duration: brief
Months: March to June
Slopes:  0 to 12 percent
Elevation:  760 to 1000 feet
Range of mean annual temperature: 53 to 55 degrees F
Range of mean annual precipitation: 34 to 40 inches
Precipitation pattern: udic
Frost-free period: 170 to 190 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bismarckgrove, Bourbonais, Eudora, Kimo, Kiro, Stonehouse, and Zeandale soils. 
The Bismarckgrove soils are fine-silty and are somewhat lower on the flood plain. 
The Bourbonais soils are coarse-silty over sandy and occupy similar landscapes. 
The Eudora soils have a mollic epipedon and are on similar flood plains. 
Kimo soils are clayey over loamy and are lower on the flood plain. 
Kiro soils are poorly drained and in depressions.
The Stonehouse soils are sandy and are higher on the flood plain.
Zeandale soils are coarse-silty and have calcium carbonates throughout.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage: Well
Runoff: negligible to low 
Permeability: moderate 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. The main crops are corn, alfalfa, soybeans, and sorghum. Native vegetation is tall prairie grasses. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: LRR M; MLRA 106. The intermediate floodplain of the Kansas River Valley. Acreage is of small extent.
