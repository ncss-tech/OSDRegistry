BRASSEY SERIES


The Brassey series consists of very deep, well drained soils with moderate permeability that formed in volcaniclastic sediments and alluvium from igneous rocks. Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent in intermontane basins. The average annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Ultic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Brassey gravelly loam, forested -- on a 5 percent concave southeast-facing slope at 4,360 feet elevation. When described on August 2, 2001, the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Apmat, Durst, Fergie, Fraval, Henhoit, Little Wood, Morningstar, Mulshoe, Sapkin and Sattley series. Apmat soils have 10 to 18 percent clay in the argillic horizon. Durst, Fraval, Mulshoe and Sapkin soils have a lithic or paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Fergie soils have bedrock at 40 to 60 inches and are dry 90 to 120 days. Henhoit soils are deeper than 50 inches to the base of the argillic horizon and have hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR. Little Wood soils do not have an O horizon, are dry for more than 75 consecutive days (12 to 18 inches annual precipitation) and are 21 to 34 inches deep to the sandy-skeletal substratum and base of argillic horizon. Morningstar have 25 to 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon and do not have sandy-skeletal substratum. Sattley soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock and are dry about 105 consecutive days during summer and fall.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Brassey soils are on alluvial fan remnants at elevations of 4,050 to 5,100 feet. These soils formed in volcaniclastic sediments and alluvium from igneous rocks. Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent. Average annual precipitation is 24 to 28 inches. Average annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. Frost-free period is 60 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Middlefork soils which are fine-loamy and occur on similar geomorphic positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow runoff; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Brassey soils are used mainly for timber production and woodland grazing. Some areas are used for homesites. Native vegetation is Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine and common snowberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West-central Idaho. MLRA 44. Brassey soils are of small extent.
