BRIDGERTON SERIES

The Bridgerton series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rock over residuum weathered from shale.  These soils are on escarpments, hills and landslides.  Slopes are 15 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 530 mm and annual air temperature is about 1 degree C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic Vertic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Bridgerton silty clay loam, in forest land (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 4 cm; slightly decomposed plant material; strongly acid (pH 5.5); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 5 cm thick)

    E--4 to 10 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; hard, very firm, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; many very fine and fine, and common medium and coarse roots; many fine interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (5 to 12 cm thick)

    BE--10 to 20 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silty clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; hard, very firm, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; many very fine and fine, and common medium and coarse roots; many fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 15 cm thick)

    Btk--20 to 74 cm; gray (2.5Y 6/1) silty clay, gray (2.5Y 5/1) moist; 15 percent medium prominent brown (7.5YR 4/4) mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, extremely firm, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; many very fine and fine, and common medium and coarse roots; many fine tubular pores; 60 percent continuous distinct clay films on all faces of peds;  finely disseminated secondary calcium carbonate in matrix; strongly; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (30 to 60 cm thick)

    BCk1--74 to 120 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; 20 percent medium prominent gray (10YR 6/1) mottles; massive; hard, very firm, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium and coarse roots; many fine tubular pores;  finely disseminated secondary calcium carbonate in matrix; 5 percent parachanners; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); gradual wavy boundary. (35 to 60 cm thick)

    BCk2--120 to 200 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) parachannery silty clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; 25 percent coarse prominent gray (10YR 6/1) mottles; massive; hard, very firm, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium and coarse roots; many fine interstitial pores; finely disseminated secondary calcium carbonate in matrix; 15 percent parachanners; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).
