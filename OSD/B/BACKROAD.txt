BACKROAD SERIES 

The Backroad series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over glacial outwash.  These soils are on mountains and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Andic Dystrudepts 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Backroad gravelly ashy silt loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; undecomposed and slightly decomposed forest litter.

(2 to 4 inches thick) 

    Bw--5 to 14 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly ashy silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; 25 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary. (7 to 11 inches thick) 

    2E--14 to 23 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; 10 percent cobbles, 40 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 15 inches thick) 

    2E/Bw1--23 to 34 inches; E part (80 percent) is very pale brown (10YR 8/3) extremely gravelly silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist, Bw part (20 percent) is very pale brown (10YR 7/4) extremely gravelly silt loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; 10 percent cobbles, 60 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual wavy boundary. (8 to 20 inches thick) 

    2E/Bw2--34 to 60 inches; E part (60 percent) is very pale brown (10YR 8/3) extremely gravelly silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist, Bw part (40 percent) is very pale brown (10YR 7/4) extremely gravelly silt loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine, medium, and coarse roots; 15 percent cobbles, 70 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Backroad soils are used mainly for woodland, understory grazing, and wildlife habitat. Potential native vegetation is mainly ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, western larch, lodgepole pine, and grand fir. Understory vegetation is mainly common snowberry, white spirea, pinegrass, twinflower, and other forbs and shrubs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Backroad soils are of small extent in the mountains of northwestern Montana.
