BACA SERIES


The Baca series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed material from Tertiary pedisediments modified by wind. Baca soils are on plains and uplands. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Aridic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Baca silt loam, rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

     A--0 to 5 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft, very friable; neutral (pH 6.6 - 7.3); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick)

     BA--5 to 8 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) light clay loam; brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium and fine prismatic structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocks; slightly hard, very friable; few faint clay films on horizontal and vertical faces of peds; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4 - 7.8); clear smooth boundary. 

     Bt--8 to 20 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate and strong prismatic structure parting to moderate and strong fine and very fine angular blocks; very hard, friable; few distinct clay films; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4 - 7.8); gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 7 to 19 inches)

     Btk--20 to 24 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay loam; brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak and moderate medium subangular blocks; hard, friable; some visible calcium carbonate as concretions; few distinct clay films on horizontal and vertical faces of peds; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9 - 8.4); gradual smooth boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick)

     Bk1--24 to 44 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay loam; brown (10YR 5/3) moist; hard, very friable; massive; visible secondary calcium carbonate in finely divided forms as thin seams and streaks, and as small concretions; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9 - 8.4); gradual smooth boundary. (15 to 24 inches thick)

     Bk2--44 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam; brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable; some calcium carbonate mostly as concretions and in thin seams and streaks inherent in the parent material; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9 - 8.4). (Several feet thick)

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle size control section: the zone from 8 to 24 inches. (Bt and Btk horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  the zone from 0 to 5 inches. (A horizon)
Argillic horizon: the zone from 8 to 24 inches. (Bt and Btk horizons)

Class is changed from Ustollic Haplargids to Aridic Haplustalfs due to additional moisture in the moisture control section. Last updated by the state 3/94.

The assignment of the cation exchange activity class is supported by laboratory sample #S87CO071-005.

Modified by Lee Neve in 1/2002 to include RIC for the Btk horizon and major re-format of the OSD.
