BANGTAIL SERIES

The Bangtail series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in sedimentary residuum and colluvium. These soils are on hills, mountains, and escarpments. Slopes are 4 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 533 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 2.2 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive Ustic Argicryolls  

TYPICAL PEDON: Bangtail loam, in rangeland (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 23 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; many very fine, common fine and few medium pores; 5 percent channers, 10 percent shale parachanners; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 36 cm thick)

    Bt1--23 to 36 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; many very fine and few fine and medium pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent channers, 10 percent shale parachanners; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.

    Bt2--36 to 58 cm; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; common very fine and few fine and medium pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent channers, 15 percent shale parachanners; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of Bt horizons is 36 to 76 cm).

    C--58 to 94 cm; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) clay loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; common very fine and few fine and medium pores; 5 percent channers, 20 percent shale parachanners; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 38 cm thick)

    Cr--94 to 152 cm; olive yellow (2.5Y 6/6) very weakly cemented shale and fine grained sandstone; neutral (pH 6.8).
