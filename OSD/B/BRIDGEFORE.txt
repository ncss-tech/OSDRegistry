BRIDGEFORE SERIES

The Bridgefore series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and/or colluvium over residuum derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rock. These soils are on mountain slopes and ridges.  Slopes are 5 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 550 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 1 degree C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Umbric Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Bridgefore gravelly loam, in coniferous forest (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 20 cm; dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2) gravelly loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; many fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.7); clear smooth boundary. (12 to 24 cm thick)

    Bt1--20 to 54 cm; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 10 percent clay films on all faces of peds; 50 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.3); gradual smooth boundary.

    Bt2--54 to 100 cm; reddish brown (5YR 5/3), very gravelly loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3), moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; many fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 20 percent clay films on all faces of peds; 50 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.7); gradual smooth boundary. (combined thickness of Bt horizons - 50 to 90 cm)

    BC1--100 to 165 cm; reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/8) clay loam, reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/8) moist; moderate fine angular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few very fine vesicular pores; 2 percent gravel; very strongly acid (pH 4.9); abrupt smooth boundary.

    BC2--165 to 200 cm; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) clay loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few very fine vesicular pores; 2 percent gravel; very strongly acid (pH 4.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (combined thickness of BC horizons - 60 to 120 cm)

    C--200 to 231 cm; reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/6) sandy loam, reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/6) moist; massive; hard, firm, nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine vesicular pores; 2 percent gravel; very strongly acid (pH 4.8).
