BAYUCOS SERIES

 The Bayucos series is a member of the fine-loamy, mixed
 (calcareous), hyperthermic family of Typic Fluvaquents. (see
 Remarks)  These saline soils have gray fine sandy loam C1g
 horizons and gray or light brownish gray loamy lower Cg horizons
 with sandy and silty strata.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, hyperthermic Typic Fluvaquents

 TYPICAL PEDON:  Bayucos fine sandy loam - idle.
                   (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise
 stated.)

      C1g  --  0-6 inches, gray (10YR 6/1) fine sandy loam; common,
 medium, faint, light yellowish brown mottles; massive; friable;
 slightly sticky; common medium roots; many fine and medium pores;
 few thin strata of loam; saline; calcareous; moderately alkaline;
 clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 12 inches thick)

      C2g  --  6-14 inches, gray (10YR 5/1) loam; common, medium,
 faint, light yellowish brown mottles; massive; friable, sticky;
 common fine roots; many medium pores; few thin strata of very fine
 sandy loam; saline; calcareous; moderately alkaline; gradual
 smooth boundary.  (5 to 20 inches thick)

      C3g  --  14-27 inches, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam;
 few, medium, faint, pink mottles; massive; friable, sticky; common
 fine roots; many medium pores; few small shells; saline;
 calcareous; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (7 to
 20 inches thick)

      C4g  --  27-45 inches, gray (10YR 6/1) loam; few, fine faint,
 light brownish gray mottles; massive; friable, sticky; few fine
 roots; few thin strata of very fine sandy loam; saline;
 calcareous; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to
 20 inches thick)

      C5g  --  45-60 inches, gray (10YR 6/1) loam; common, medium,
 distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) mottles; massive; friable,
 sticky; thin strata of fine sandy loam; few small shells; saline;
 calcareous; moderately alkaline.

 TYPE LOCATION:  Calhoun County, Texas; 2.6 miles south of Port
 O'Connor on Bayucos Island; 700 feet north of Saluria Bayou and
 260 feet east of Mitchell Cut.

 RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The 10- to 40-inch control section
 averages between 18 and 30 percent clay.  Texture is loam, clay
 loam, silty clay loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam.  Strata of
 very fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, silt, sandy clay loam, or
 silty clay are in most pedons.  Colors are light gray (10YR 7/1,
 7/2; 2.5Y 7/2; 5Y 7/1, 7/2), gray (10YR 6/1, 5/1; 5Y 6/1, 5/1; N
 5/ , N 6/ ), dark gray (10YR 4/1; N 4/ ), light brownish gray
 (10YR 6/2; 2.5Y  6/2) pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2), light olive gray
 (5Y 6/2), light greenish gray (5GY 7/1; 5G 7/1), or greenish gray
 (5GY 6/1; 5G 6/1).  Brownish or pinkish mottles range from few to
 common in most pedons.  In places, the thin sandy strata are
 brownish, pinkish, or olive in color.  The N value is less than
 .7.  Salinity, as expressed in mmhos/cm., ranges from 20 to 50.

 COMPETING SERIES:  These include the
 Angelina, Barrada, Hialeah, Ijam, and Veston series.  Angelina
 soils have soil temperatures of less than 72 degrees F.  In
 addition, Angelina soils are acid.  Barrada and Ijam soils have
 more than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Hialeah soils
 have carbonatic mineralogy.  Veston soils have a fine-silty
 control section.

 GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bayucos soils are nearly level, occurring near sea level  on islands along the Texas Gulf Coast.  The soils are not covered
 by daily tides, but are frequently covered by high tides.  The
 soil formed in saline loamy sediments of recent deposits.
 Sediments have been reworked and sorted by wave action and by
 wind.  The climate is humid subtropical.  Annual precipitation
 ranges from 30 to 45 inches.  Average annual temperature ranges
 from 70 degrees to 73 degrees F.  Thornthwaite P-E index ranges
 from 40 to 64.

 GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dianola and Mustang
 series.  Dianola and Mustang soils have less than 10 percent clay
 in the control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained; very slow runoff
 to ponded; moderate permeability.  The water table is within 20
 inches of the surface at all times and the soil is moist to the
 surface continuously.  Extremely high tides cover the soils
 frequently.

 USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for wildlife.  Vegetation consists of a
 sparse stand of matrimony vine, pickleweed, rushes, sedges, and a
 few clumps of marshhay cordgrass and smooth cordgrass.

 DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  On islands in the bays along the central
 part of the Gulf Coast of Texas.  The series is of minor extent,
 comprising about 5,000 acres.

 SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Calhoun County, Texas; 1972.

 REMARKS:  The soils probably would have been classified in the
 Half-Bog soil group.  They have been mapped as the Marsh land type
 in the past.

 ADDITIONAL DATA:  Lincoln Laboratory samples 70L761-70L762
 indicating mixed mineralogy.  These soils are within the range of
 @halic@ chemical properties described in the proposed changes in
 Soil Taxonomy by Coover, et. al., and would be included in the
 Halaquents great soil group pending approval.
