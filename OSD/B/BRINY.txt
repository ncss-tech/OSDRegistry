BRINY SERIES

The Briny series consists of very deep, poorly or very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from shale and siltstone. Briny soils are on alluvial flats, flood plains and drainageways. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 190 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, active, mesic Typic Aquisalids

TYPICAL PEDON: Briny silty clay loam, on a south facing linear 2 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 1,761 meters. When described on March 27, 1995 the soil was wet from 25 to 157 cm. The surface was covered by a salty chemical crust. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)  

    Az--0 to 6 cm; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay loam, light gray (2.5Y 7/2) dry; moderate thick platy structure; very friable, slightly hard, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and very fine roots; finely disseminated salts (EC 160 mmhos/cm); strongly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2); abrupt smooth boundary.

    Azg--6 to 24 cm; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) silty clay loam, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) dry; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and very fine roots; finely disseminated salts (EC 50 mmhos/cm); common fine yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist oxidized iron masses; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); clear wavy boundary. (combined thickness of the A horizons is 8 to 25 cm)

    Bzg1--24 to 65 cm; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silt loam, light gray (2.5Y 7/2) dry; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and very fine roots; common fine yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist oxidized iron masses and common fine dark gray (2.5Y 4/1) moist iron depletions; finely disseminated salts (EC 30 mmhos/cm); strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.9); gradual wavy boundary.

    Bzg2--65 to 97 cm; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2)silty clay loam, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) dry; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few very fine roots; common fine yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist oxidized iron masses and common medium dark gray (2.5Y 4/1) moist iron depletions; finely disseminated salts and extremely coarse salt crystals in the matrix (EC 38 mmhos/cm); strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear wavy boundary.(combined thickness of the Bzg horizons is 18 to 75 cm)

    Czg--97 to 157 cm; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) silt loam, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) dry; massive; slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common fine yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist oxidized iron masses and common medium dark gray (2.5Y 4/1) moist iron depletions; finely disseminated salts (EC 20 mmhos/cm); strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - alluvial flats, flood plains and drainageways 
Elevation - 1,219 to 1,981 meters
Slope - 0 to 4 percent
Parent material - alluvium derived from shale and siltstone
Mean annual precipitation - 150 to 230 mm
Precipitation pattern - significant increases in late summer to early fall; significant decreases in late spring and early winter
Mean annual air temperature - 7.2 to 11.7 degrees C
Frost-free period - 120 to 160 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Abbott, Billings, Hunting, and Rafael series. These soils do not have a salic horizon. Abbott soils are on landscape positions downslope of Briny soils and have a fine particle-size class. Billings soils are on positions upslope of Briny soils and support shadscale saltbush. Hunting soils are on slightly higher positions. Rafael soils are in concave areas downslope of Briny soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained; moderately slow and moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for pasture and rangeland. Native vegetation is widely scattered inland saltgrass, alkali sacaton, Baltic rush and greasewood.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Briny soils are of moderate extent in central Utah and western Colorado. MLRA 34B.
