BICONDOA SERIES

The Bicondoa series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in clayey alluvium from tuff and basalt. Bicondoa soils are on floodplains and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil moisture: Saturated between the soil surface and 45 cm during most years unless drained. 
Mean annual soil temperature: 6 to 8 degrees C. 
Mean summer soil temperature: 16 to 17 degrees C. 
Mollic epipedon thickness: 25 to 50 cm.
Carbonates - Calcareous throughout most of their upper 50 cm (and are slightly calcareous to noncalcareous below the water table.
Reaction - Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline but ranges to very strongly alkaline in sodic areas. pH values decrease with depth or remain constant.
Redoximorphic features - Redox concentrations and depletions with reddish or yellowish hue, neutral, low chroma, or high chroma are in the lower part of the A horizon or in any part of the Bw and C horizon. Where moist chroma of 2 is present with moist value of 3, the horizon immediately under the mollic epipedon has moist value of 3 or 4 and moist chroma of 1. 

Particle size control section - Clay content: Averages 40 to 60 percent.

A horizon 
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y.
Value: 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma: 1 or 2.
Structure: Moderate or strong, very fine or fine granular or subangular blocky structure.
Organic matter: 2 to 4 percent

Bw horizon  
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y.
Value: 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 1 or 2.
Structure: Weak or moderate, medium or coarse, prismatic or subangular blocky structure.
Organic matter: 0.5 to 2 percent

C horizon  
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y, but ranges to 5Y in the lower C horizon.
Value: 6 or 7 dry and 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma: 1 to 4.
Other features: Redox depletions occur in the lower C horizon of some pedons. One or more buried A horizons, up to 20 centimeters thick, are present in some pedons.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series at present.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bicondoa soils are on nearly level floodplains at elevations of 1,340 to 1,615 meters. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in alluvium derived mostly from tuff and basalt. The climate is cool, semiarid. Mean annual precipitation is 175 to 300 mm. The mean annual temperature ranges from 6 to 8 degrees C, mean January temperature of about -2 to -3 degrees C, and mean July temperature of about 20.6 to 21 degrees C. The frost free period is 70 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Four Star, Hussa, and Kisring soils. Four Star soils have ashy control sections. Hussa soils have ashy control sections. Kisring soils lack a mollic epipedon and have a calcic horizon with durinodes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained; very slow runoff; slow permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity class. Water table is above 46 cm except in drained phases.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for irrigated meadow production. The meadows are either cut for meadow hay or are grazed by livestock. Vegetation is predominantly rushes, sedges, and grasses in the less saline-sodic affected areas; and rushes, sedges, and salt grass in the more saline-sodic affected areas.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Bicondoa soils have been recognized in Surprise Valley-Home Camp Area, California and Nevada; the Tuscarora Mountain Area, Nevada; the Diamond Valley Area, Nevada; and Lake County, Oregon, Southern Part. The soil is of moderate extent. MLRA 23 and 25.
