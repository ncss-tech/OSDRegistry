BIGSALT SERIES

The Bigsalt series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in clayey alluvium. These nearly level soils are on flood plains and alluvial flats. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bigsalt soils are on floodplains and alluvial flats. Slope is 0 to 1 percent. These soils formed in clayey alluvium. Elevation ranges from 3,900 to 4,020 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. Precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September. The mean annual air temperature is 64 to 70 degrees F. The frost-free period is 180 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Najul series. Najul soils do not have salic horizons.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: well drained; medium runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: The major uses are military exercises and wildlife habitat. The site is normally devoid of vegetation but the sparse native vegetation is desert seepweed, four-wing saltbush, iodine bush, salt cedar, inland saltgass and alkali sacaton.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South central New Mexico, limited to the Tularosa Basin.  MLRA 42, Bigsalt is of limited extent.
