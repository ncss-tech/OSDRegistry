BOWERS SERIES

The Bowers series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in stratified loamy lacustrine deposits on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 711 mm (28 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, semiactive, frigid Aquic Glossudalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Bowers loam, on a west-facing, 2 percent slope in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 18 cm (7 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak medium granular structure; friable; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [13 to 23 cm (5 to 9 inches) thick]

 E--18 to 28 cm (7 to 11 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sandy loam, light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine distinct very dark gray (10YR 3/1) organic stains; slightly acid; abrupt irregular boundary. [0 to18 cm (7 inches) thick]

 B/E--28 to 51 cm (11 to 20 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam (Bt); occupies about 85 percent of the horizon surrounded by light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sandy loam (E); moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; many fine prominent yellowish red (5YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; slightly acid; clear irregular boundary. [8 to 25 cm (3 to 10 inches) thick]

 Bt--51 to 74 cm (20 to 29 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silty clay loam; strong medium angular blocky structure; very firm; few distinct grayish brown clay films; many fine distinct gray (10YR 5/1) iron depletions in the matrix; few fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; neutral; clear wavy boundary. [13 to 51 cm (5 to 20 inches) thick]

 C--74 to 152 cm (29 to 60 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam with a few layers of silt loam 3 mm to 5 cm (1/8 to 2 inches) thick; moderate medium angular blocky structure; firm; many fine prominent pinkish gray (5YR 7/2) iron depletions in the matrix; few fine prominent red (2.5YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Kawkawlin, Pinewood, and Selkirk series. Kawkawlin soils have rock fragments throughout the series control section and are not stratified in the lower part. Pinewood soils have textures that contain more than 50 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Selkirk soils average more than 40 percent clay in the particle-size control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Bowers soils are on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. These soils formed in stratified loamy lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 864 mm (27 to 34 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 5.0 to 8.3 degrees C (41 to 47 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hettinger, Menominee, Nunica, and Rudyard soils. The moderately well drained and well drained Nunica soils and the poorly drained or very poorly drained Hettinger soils are in the same drainage sequence. The Rudyard soils and the Menominee soils are associated in some areas. The Rudyard soils have more clay in the subsoil. The well drained Menominee soils are sandy in the upper part of the profile.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 30 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) between October and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff ranges from low to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low. Permeability is slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: The greater part is cropped to small grains and hay; minor crops are corn and beans. A smaller part is in permanent pasture or forest. The native vegetation is chiefly sugar maple, white ash, yellow birch, balsam fir, northern red oak, and American basswood.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 93B, 94A, 94B, 94C, and 99 in northern Lower Peninsula and Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This series is of moderate extent.
