BYBEE SERIES

The Bybee series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in colluvium from andesite, volcanic tuffs and breccias.  Bybee soils are on mountains and have slopes of 1 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Typic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bybee loam - on a 7 percent slope under mixed conifers at 4,600 feet elevation.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

O--1/2 inch to 0; conifer needles and forest litter, loose and partially decomposed in lower part.

A1--0 to 4 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, dark brown (10YR 4/2) dry; moderate fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and common medium roots; many irregular pores; 5 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.5); abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)
A2--4 to 10 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many fine and common medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

2Bw1--10 to 14 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) clay, brown (10YR 4/3) dry; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; few medium and coarse roots; many very fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

2Bw2--14 to 38 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) clay, variegated light gray (2.5Y 7/2) and light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) dry; weak medium and coarse blocky structure, massive when wet; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; few medium and coarse roots; many very fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel and cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (12 to 24 inches thick)

2C--38 to 60 inches; variegated light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) clay, variegated light gray (2.5Y 7/2) and light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) dry; massive; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; 5 percent gravel and cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  Jackson County, Oregon; about 1/4 mile northeast of Shale City, approximately 1,525 feet north and 450 feet west of the southeast corner of sec. 9, T. 38 S., R. 2 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness typically is less than 40 inches.  Depth to weathered bedrock is 60 inches or more.  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, but are dry between depths of 4 to 12 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 40 to 55 percent clay.  Rock fragments average 5 to 25 percent of which 5 to 20 percent are gravel and 0 to 5 percent are cobbles.  A stoneline occurs in some pedons.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR of 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.

The 2B and 2C horizons have hues of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 7 moist and dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is clay or gravelly clay.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Bybee soils consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on mountain slopes.  These soils formed in clayey colluvium weathered from tuff, breccia, and andesite.  Elevation is 3,600 to 5,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 50 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is less than 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Farva, Hobit, Kanutchan, Pinehurst and Tatouche series.  Hobit soils are fine-loamy and have a cryic soil temperature regime.  Kanutchan soils are poorly drained and crack to the surface.  Tatouche soils have an argillic horizon and are deep.  Farva soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock and are loamy-skeletal.  Pinehurst soils are fine-loamy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; slow to medium runoff; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for timber production, wildlife, water supply and recreation.  Native vegetation consists of white fir, Douglas fir, incense cedar, California black oak, Oregon grape, and wild strawberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Cascade Mountains of southwestern Oregon.  The series is of limited extent.
