BOGER SERIES

The Boger series consists of shallow over duripan, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basalt with a component of loess and volcanic ash. The Boger soils are on basalt plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Vitrixerandic Haplodurids

TYPICAL PEDON: Boger cobbly ashy very fine sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is covered with 15 percent cobbles.

(8 to 18 cm thick)

    2Bqkm--48 to 71 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) silica and carbonate cemented indurated duripan; massive; 1 to 2 mm thick silica laminae; violently effervescent; abrupt wavy boundary. (8 to 38 cm thick)

TYPE LOCATION: Humboldt County, Nevada; approximately 4 miles north of Winnemucca about 2,000 feet west and 1,600 feet south of the northeast corner of section 5, T. 36 N., R. 38 E.; USGS Weso 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 41 degrees 1 minute 41.6 seconds north and longitude 117 degrees 43 minutes 24.4 seconds west; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 41.0282222 latitude, -117.7234444 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in December through May, dry mid-June through November; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C.
Depth to Bqk horizon: 13 to 38 cm.
Depth to duripan; 36 to 50 cm.
Depth to bedrock: 36 to 76 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content; 10 to 18 percent.
Rock fragments: 35 to 60 percent, mainly cobbles and stones; lithology of fragments is basalt.

A horizon
Value: 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3.
Reaction: Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.
Other features: Combined thickness of the A horizons are 10 to 20 cm.
Volcanic glass: Volcanic glass is estimated to range from 30 to 50 percent of the 0.2 to 2 mm fraction.

Bqk horizon

Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.
Cementation: 20 to 80 percent discontinuous brittle matrix with 20 to 60 percent very hard durinodes.
Volcanic glass: Volcanic glass is estimated to range from 10 to 30 percent of the 0.2 to 2 mm fraction.

Bqkm horizon
Rock Fragments: 40 to 60 percent, mainly cobbles and stones that are cemented in the matrix.
Other features: Strongly cemented lenses are common in some pedons.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Boger soils are on basalt plateaus. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basalt with a component of loess and volcanic ash. Slopes are 0 to 50 percent. Elevation is 1,330 to 1,950 meters. . The climate is cool, semiarid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual air temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dun Glen and Old Camp soils. Dun Glen soils have a cambic horizon and lack a duripan and a lithic contact. Old Camp soils have loamy-skeletal argillic horizons overlying bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained, slow to rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail and Sandberg bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Nevada and southeast Oregon. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 24, 23.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Humboldt County, Nevada, East Part, 1993.

REMARKS: December, 2008 revision changes classification from Xeric Haplodurids to Vitrixerandic Haplodurids to fit current Keys to Taxonomy based on presence of volcanic ash.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (A1, A2, A3 and part of 2Bqk1 horizons).
Indurated duripan - The zone from 48 to 71 cm (Bqkm horizon).
Ashy textures - Volcanic glass is estimated to be 20 to 50 percent of the 0.02 to 2 mm fraction in the zone from 0 to 15 cm (A horizons) and 10 to 30 percent in the Bqk horizons. 
Lithic contact - The boundary at 71 cm (3R layer).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 25 cm to the top of the duripan at 48 cm (part of the 2Bqk1 and the 2Bqk2 horizons).
