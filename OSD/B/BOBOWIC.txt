BOBOWIC SERIES

The Bobowic series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium or residuum derived from granite bedrock.  These soils are on dissected hills and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bobowic gravelly coarse sandy loam, very bouldery, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oe--0 to 3 cm; partially decomposed needles, twigs, and leaves. (1 to 8 cm thick) 

    A--3 to 11 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly coarse sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine and fine and few medium pores; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 13 cm thick) 

    E--11 to 31 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate coarse platy structure parting to weak fine angular blocky; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and few fine and medium roots; many very fine and few fine interstitial and tubular pores; 25 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (18 to 30 cm thick) 

    Bw--31 to 56 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and few fine and medium roots; many very fine and few fine interstitial and tubular pores; 25 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (25 to 64 cm thick) 

    Cr--56 to 89 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) decomposed granite bedrock (grus) that crushes to gravelly loamy coarse sand; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary. 

    R--89 cm; hard granite bedrock.

Bobowic soils have a cryic soil temperature regime and an ustic soil moisture regime. 

Classification changed from Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Ustic Eutrocryepts to Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified. 3/2008

Converted to metric and O horizons were updated to start at zero. Competing series section was not updated. 01/2023
