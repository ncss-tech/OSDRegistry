BOBOWIC SERIES 

The Bobowic series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium or residuum derived from granite bedrock.  These soils are on dissected hills and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryepts 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bobowic gravelly coarse sandy loam, very bouldery, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--1 to 0 inches; partially decomposed needles, twigs, and leaves. (1/2 to 3 inches thick) 

    A--0 to 3 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly coarse sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine and fine and few medium pores; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 5 inches thick) 

    E--3 to 11 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate coarse platy structure parting to weak fine angular blocky; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and few fine and medium roots; many very fine and few fine interstitial and tubular pores; 25 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (7 to 12 inches thick) 

    Bw--11 to 21 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and few fine and medium roots; many very fine and few fine interstitial and tubular pores; 25 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 25 inches thick) 

    Cr--21 to 34 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) decomposed granite bedrock (grus) that crushes to gravelly loamy coarse sand; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary. 

    R--34 inches; hard granite bedrock.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Jefferson County, Montana, 1998. 

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1595, MT3074.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a layer of partially decomposed needles, twigs, and leaves from 1 inch to the mineral soil surface (Oi horizon); an ochric epipedon from the mineral surface to 7 inches, mixed (A, E horizons); an albic horizon from 3 to 11 inches (E horizon); a layer of decomposed granite (grus) from 21 to 34 inches (Cr horizon); hard granite bedrock at 34 inches (R horizon); a cambic horizon from 11 to 21 inches (Bw horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 21 inches (E, Bw horizons).  Bobowic soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime. 

The 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Ustic Eutrocryepts to Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.
