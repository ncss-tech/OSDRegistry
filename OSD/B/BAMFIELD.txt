BAMFIELD SERIES

The Bamfield series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy till on ground moraines and disintegration moraines. Slope ranges from 12 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C (44 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Mossback, Neckrock, Pecore, and Tilleda series. Mossback soils have less than 27 percent clay in the argillic horizon. Neckrock soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Pecore soils are sandy and gravelly within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Tilleda soils are deeper than 102 cm (40 inches) to carbonates. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bamfield soils are on ground moraines and disintegration moraines. Slope ranges from 12 to 70 percent. The Bamfield soils formed in loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 813 mm (27 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature is 6 or 7 degrees C (43 to 45 degrees F). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Glennie, Lupton, Hottis, Nester and Ossineke soils. The moderately well drained Glennie soils and well drained Hottis soils are on nearby till plains and moraines. The moderately well drained Nester and Ossineke soils are on the same landforms as the Bamfield soils on the less sloping areas. The Glennie soils have fragipans and contain less clay in the argillic horizon. The Hottis and Nester soils contain more clay in the argillic horizon. The very poorly drained Lupton soils are in closed depressions on moraines. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The potential for surface runoff is medium to very high depending on slope. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to low. Permeability is moderately slow to very slow. 

USE AND VEGETATION: A major portion of the soil is woodland or forested. Tree species include sugar maple, northern red oak, American basswood, bigtooth aspen, paper birch, American beech, white ash, and eastern hemlock. Other areas are used as cropland and pastureland. The common crops include hay, alfalfa, and occasionally corn. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 94A and 96 in the northern part of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. The series is of moderate extent.
