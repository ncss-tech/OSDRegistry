BOLD SERIES

The Bold series consists of deep well drained soils formed in thick calcareous loess on uplands. Slope ranges from 4 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 11.7 degrees C (53 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Typic Udorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bold silt loam (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Ap--0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) silt loam, brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) dry; weak very fine and fine granular structure; very friable; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  [8 to 31 cm (3 to 12 inches) thick]

   C1--18 to 76 cm (7 to 30 inches); mottled yellowish brown (10YR 5/6), yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) and light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam; massive; very friable; strongly effervesent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.  [15 cm to several meters (6 inches to several feet) thick]

   C2--76 to 152 cm (30 to 60 inches); light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam; massive; very friable; common medium distinct brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Menard County, Illinois; about 1 mile southwest of Athens; 1,250 feet north and 650 feet east of southwest corner of sec.  2, T. 17 N., R. 6 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Thickness of the solum: 8 to 31 cm (3 to 12 inches)
Thickness of the loess: 1.8 to more than 9 meters (6 feet to more than 30 feet), commonly calcareous throughout
Depth to carbonates: at the surface, some pedonds do not have carbonates in the upper 25 cm (10 inches)
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout, secondary lime concretions present in many pedons
Calcium carbonate equivalent: commonly 12 to 30 percent in the C horizon
Particle size control section: silt loam, 12 and 18 percent clay, and less than 10 percent total sand

Ap horizon: 
Hue: 10YR
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 2 to 6
Texture: silt loam

A horizon: 
Hue: 10YR
Value: 3 or 4
Chroma: 1 to 4
Texture: silt loam

Other features:
An AC horizon is present in some pedons.

C horizon:
Hue: commonly 10YR, 5YR in thin bands of some pedons
Value: 4 to 7
Chroma: 2 to 8 
Texture: silt loam

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Hamburg, Mula and Netawaka series.  Hamburg soils average less than 12 percent clay and more than 10 percent sand in the control section. Mula and Netawaka soils have less than 12 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bold soils are on the side slopes of dissected uplands.  Slopes dominately are between 10 and 40 percent but range from 4 to 75 percent.  The soils formed in thick calcareous loess.  The mean annual temperature ranges from about 7.2 to 13.3 degrees C (45 to 56 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation ranges from about 711 to 1016 mm (28 to 40 inches).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Alford, Fayette, Sylvan, Tallula, and Timula soils.  Alford, Fayette, and Sylvan soils have argillic horizons.  They are generally on less sloping areas both upslope and downslope from the Bold soils.  Tallula soils have a mollic epipedon and are generally on the less sloping part of the landscape.  The Timula soils have cambic horizons and are generally on the less sloping part of the landscape.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is medium to rapid.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of this soil are used for hay and pasture.  Some areas are cropped to corn, soybeans, and small grain.  Native vegetation is hardwood trees or prairie grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  MLRAs 103, 105, 108B, 114B, 115A, 115B, and 115C in Illinois and Minnesota.  The extent is moderate.
