BLEUMONT SERIES

The Bleumont series consists of very deep, well drained soils on fan terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from igneous and sedimentary rocks.  Slope is 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 53 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Aridic Paleustalfs

(8 to 12 inches thick)

    2Btk2--21 to 34 inches; variegated yellowish red (5YR 4/6) and yellowish red (5YR 5/6), and very pale brown (10YR 8/3) very cobbly sandy clay, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) and reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/6) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 25 percent gravel and 30 percent cobble, of which one-tenth are saprolite; common faint clay films on ped faces; common medium and coarse soft masses of calcium carbonate and many coatings under rock fragments; noneffervescent matrix with violently effervescent concentrations; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (12 to 20 inches thick)

    2Btk3--34 to 62 inches; variegated reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8) and pink (7.5YR 7/4), , and pink (7.5YR 8/4) extremely cobbly sandy clay loam, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) and reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/6) moist; massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 35 percent cobble, 10 percent gravel, and 20 percent stones, of which 20 percent are saprolite; few faint clay films in pores and on ped faces; weakly cemented with calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

TYPE LOCATION: Coconino County, Arizona; on the Hualapai Indian Reservation; 1650 feet east and 950 feet north of the southwest corner of section 19, T.26 N., R.8 W.; about 1 1/2 miles northeast of Blue Mountain.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture: Moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during December - February and intermittently moist during July - September.  Driest during May and June.  Aridic ustic soil moisture regime.

Soil Temperature: 54 to 56 degrees F.

Rock Fragments: less than 35 percent in the control section

Clay content: 35 to 55 percent in the control section

Depth to calcic horizon: 20 to 40 inches

Calcium carbonate equivalent: 2 to 20 percent in the upper Btk horizons and 20 to 35 percent in the calcic horizon

A horizon
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 to 4 moist
Chroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist
Rock fragments:  lag layer consisting of 30 to 65 percent gravel and 25 to 40 percent cobble

The AB horizon is not present in some pedons

Bt horizon
Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 4 to 6, dry or moist
Texture: clay, sandy clay.  (15 percent or more (absolute) clay increase at the upper boundary within a vertical distance of 1 inch)

2Btk horizon
Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR
Value: 4 to 8 dry, 4 to 7 moist
Chroma: 3 to 6, dry or moist
Texture: sandy clay loam, sandy clay
Rock fragments: 35 to 70 percent, dominantly cobble

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Brislawn (WY), Jaywest (WY), Spottedhorse (WY), series. Brislawn soils have fragmental material consisting of porcelanite at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Jaywest soils rock fragment content typically averages less than 5 percent channers throughout but ranges from 0 to 15 percent channers. Spottedhorse soils are moderately deep. In addition, Brislawn, Jaywest, Spottedhorse soils are in LRR-G and are more moist in May and June.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bleumont soils are on terrace treads and scarps of fan terraces at elevations of 5500 to 5900 feet.  These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from igneous and sedimentary rocks.  Slope ranges from 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 52 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Buckndoe, Metuck, and Milkweed series.  Buckndoe soils have a loamy-skeletal control section.  Metuck soils do not have argillic horizons and are shallow to bedrock.  Milkweed soils are loamy-skeletal and are shallow to a calcium carbonate cemented hardpan.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; rapid runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Bleumont soils are used for grazeable woodland, firewood gathering, and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is twoleaf pinyon, Utah juniper, turbinella oak, blue grama, banana yucca, and desert ceanothus.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Arizona.  This series is not extensive.
