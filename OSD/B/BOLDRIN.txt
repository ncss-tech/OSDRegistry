Hue: 2.5YR to 10YR
Value: 2 to 3
Chroma: 1 to 4
Texture: peat, mucky peat, muck
Organic matter content: 65 to 90 percent
Reaction: extremely acid to neutral

Cg horizon:
Hue: 2.5Y or 5Y

Cgf horizon:
Hue: 2.5Y or 5Y
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: gravelly loam, gravelly sandy loam, loam
Clay content: 0 to 10 percent
Silt content: 15 to 50 percent
Sand content: 30 to 75 percent
Rock fragments: 2 to 30 percent subrounded strongly cemented gravel
Reaction: very strongly acid to neutral

COMPETING SERIES: These are Dirrant and Kuswash soils. Dirrant soils have visible mica. Kuswash soil a have a mean summer soil temperature greater than 36 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landforms: footslopes on mountains, toeslopes on mountains
Parent material: loamy and/or gravelly colluvium
Elevation: 380 to 1391 feet
Slope: 0 to 15 percent
Annual precipitation: 22 to 29 inches
Annual temperature: 23 to 25 degrees F
Frost-free period: 60 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Peluk and Sinuktuk soils. Peluk soils are somewhat poorly drained and occur on alluvial fans. Sinuktuk soils are well drained, moderately deep, and occur on mountains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained, very high runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high above the permafrost and verly low in the permafrost.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for military use and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is sedge/moss herbaceous.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 240, Nulato Hills-Southern Seward Peninsula Highlands, Alaska. The series is of small extent.
