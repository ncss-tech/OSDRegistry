BENONA SERIES

The Benona series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils formed in sandy deposits on moraines, outwash plains, and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Lamellic Haplorthods

TYPICAL PEDON: Benona sand, on a 4 percent slope in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 20 cm (8 inches); dark brown (10YR 3/3) sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; very friable; about 3 percent gravel; very strongly acid; smooth boundary. [0 to 23 cm (9 inches) thick]

 Bs1--20 to 41 cm (8 to 16 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) sand; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; about 1 percent gravel; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.

 Bs2--41 to 61 cm (16 to 24 inches); strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) sand; single grain; loose; about 3 percent gravel; strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bs horizon is 20 to 56 cm (8 to 22 inches).]

 Bs3--61 to 117 cm (24 to 46 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) sand; single grain; loose; about 2 percent gravel; strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. [0 to 76 cm (30 inches) thick]

 E and Bt--117 to 152 cm (46 to 60 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) sand (E); single grain; loose; thin discontinuous strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) loamy sand lamella (Bt) 2 to 3 mm (1/16 to 1/8 inches) thick; accumulation of lamellae is less than 15 cm (6 inches); weak fine granular structure; very friable; about 2 percent gravel; moderately acid. [38 to 66 cm (15 to 26 inches) thick]

TYPE LOCATION: Oceana County, Michigan about 2.5 miles southeast of the village of Hart; 1340 feet east and 660 feet south of the center of sec. 34, T. 15 N., R. 17 W.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. Similar soils in related families are the Benzonia series. Benzonia soils have a Bhs horizon and are in the isotic mineralogy family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Benona soils are on moraines, outwash plains, and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent. The Benona soils formed in sandy deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 813 mm (28 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.7 to 8.9 degrees C (44 to 48 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Grattan, Plainfield, and Spinks soils, which occupy similar landscape positions. The Grattan and Plainfield soils do not have lamella, and the Spinks soils have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Excessively drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium depending on slope. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high. Permeability is rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in cropland with some in woodland. Native vegetation is eastern white pine, white oak, and northern red oak. Current vegetation includes quaking aspen, red pine, eastern white pine, American beech, sugar maple, and red maple.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 96 and 98 in western Lower Peninsula of Michigan. The series is of large extent.
