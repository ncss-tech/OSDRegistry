BANQUETE SERIES

The Banquete series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey fluviomarine sediments derived from the Beaumont Formation of Late Pleistocene age.  These nearly level soils are in open-ended shallow depressions and swales on flat plains on the South Texas Coastal Plain.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 in).

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil Moisture:  An ustic soil moisture regime that borders on udic.  The soil moisture control section is from 10 to 30 cm (4 to 12 in) below the soil surface.  Desiccation cracks that are 5 mm or more wide through a thickness of over 25 cm (10 in) stay open for less than 150 cumulative days per year.  The period when cracks remain open is from June to August, when conditions are the driest.
Mean annual soil temperature: 22.2 to 22.8 degrees C (72 to 73 degrees F).
Depth to secondary calcium carbonate: 41 to 74 cm (16 to 29 in)
These are cyclic soils comprised of microlows and microhighs.  The distance from the center of the microlow to the highest point on the microhighs is from 1.5 to 2.5 meters (5 to 8 ft).  Microlows colors are typically lower in value and chroma and are noneffervescent.  Microhighs are slightly to strongly effervescent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Nueces County, Texas, 2007.  The name is from a town near the type location.

REMARKS:  The soil series is reactivated as a result of fieldwork performed during the 2005 update of MLRA 150A.  The series was proposed and correlated in the 1965 Nueces County Soil Survey and later was deactivated and included in the Edroy series.  The series is reestablished with the 2007 correlation of the Kenedy-Kleberg Counties soil survey and defines soils as originally mapped in the 1965 Nueces County soil survey.  The Banquete series is separated from the Edroy series based on classification.  Redoximorphic features are considered relict, or they form during above normal precipitation events of long periods that occur during the occasional tropical storm event.  This is the last series reestablished and updated by C. L. Neitsch 12/2007.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 71 cm (0 to 28 in). (A, Bss, and Bkss1 horizons)
Redoximorphic concentrations: 0 to 141 cm (0 to 56 in). (A, Bss, Bkss1, Bkss2, Bkss3, and Bk horizons)
Secondary Carbonates: 54 to 141 cm (21 to 56 in). (Bkss1, Bkss2, Bkss3 and Bk horizons)
The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by local laboratory data from the type location from Nueces County, Texas.
Lithological discontinuity at 142 cm (56 in) based on contrasting particle sizes.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  TAMU data is available from the type location in Nueces County, TX on sample S05TX-355-003.
