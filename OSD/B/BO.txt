BO SERIES


The Bo series consists of very deep, well drained soils with moderate permeability that formed in colluvium from basalt and volcanic ash over residuum from basalt. Slopes range from 15 to 65 percent in mountains. The average annual precipitation is about 33 inches and the average annual temperature is about 38 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, isotic Andic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Bo ashy loam, forested -- on a northeast-facing slope of 30 percent at 6,300 feet elevation. When described on October 18, 1994, the soil moist throughout. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     Oi--0 to 1 inch; slightly decomposed forest litter.

     A1--1 to 4 inch; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) ashy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine and medium, few coarse roots; many very fine, fine and medium irregular pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick)

     A2--4 to 10 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) ashy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine and medium, few coarse roots; many very fine, fine and medium irregular pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.3); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 8 inches thick)

     Bw1--10 to 16 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and medium, few coarse roots; many very fine, fine and medium irregular pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.3); gradual wavy boundary. (3 to 10 inches thick)

     Bw2--16 to 25 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; many very fine, fine and medium tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.3); gradual wavy boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick)

     Bw3--25 to 51 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; many very fine, fine and medium tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 30 inches thick)

     2Bw4--51 to 60 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very cobbly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; many very fine, fine and medium tubular pores; 15 percent gravel, 40 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. The Edgway series in a closely related family is loamy-skeletal.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bo soils are on mountain slopes and ridges at elevations of 4,450 to 7,050 feet. These soils formed in colluvium from basalt and volcanic ash over residuum from basalt. Slopes range from 15 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is 28 to 36 inches. The average annual temperature is 36 to 39 degrees F. The frost-free period is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Awley soils. Awley soils are loamy-skeletal and occur on similar geomorphic positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Bo soils are used mainly for timber production. Native vegetation is subalpine fir, Douglas-fir and mountain maple.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West-central Idaho. MLRA 43. Bo soils are not extensive.
