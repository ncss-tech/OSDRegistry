BATTERY SERIES

The Battery series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources. Battery soils are on uplifted, dissected terrace remnants and have slopes of 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2160 millimeters (85 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (53 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Coppercreek series. The Coppercreek soils have subangular fragments throughout.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Battery soils are on uplifted, dissected stream and strath terraces in hills and mountains. Slope gradients are 2 to 50 percent. Elevations are 17 to 280 meters (55 to 915 feet). These soils formed in alluvium from mixed sources. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1250 to 2290 millimeters (50 to 90 inches). Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free season is about 240 to 300 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Catchings, Coppercreek, and Tarquin soils. Catchings soils have more than 35 percent rock fragment in their particle size control section. Coppercreek soils have subangular fragments throughout. Tarquin has redoximorphic features below 75 centimeters.  The Catchings soils are found are linear to strongly convex slope positions alongside the Battery soils on very gravelly alluvium. Coppercreek soils are found above Battery soils on schist, sandstone, and mudstone. Tarquin soils are found in concave slope positions below the Battery soils. Where this soil is in the southern part of its range, it occurs with Scoutcamp and Redwoodhouse. Scoutcamp soils have less than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand in the particle size control section and occur on mountain slopes on siltstone. Redwoodhouse soils have greater than 35 percent base saturation by sum of cations in the lower part of the profile and occur on mountain slopes on sandstone and mudstone.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium to high runoff; Moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for timber production, wildlife, and watershed. Natural vegetation includes redwood, Douglas-fir, tanoak, western hemlock, Pacific madrone, Pacific rhododendron, and California huckleberry, and western swordfern.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coastal Redwood Belt; MLRA 4B. The series is not extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California
