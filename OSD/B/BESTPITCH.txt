SERIES ESTABLISHED: Dorchester County, Maryland, 1992

REMARKS: 
Bestpitch soils were formerly mapped as Tidal Marsh miscellaneous areas. They are flooded twice daily by saline or brackish tidal waters. Oxidized pH analysis indicate these soils have hypersulfidic materials (pH of 4.0 or less after 16 weeks of moist incubation), causing them to typically become ultra acid to extremely acid when drained. Historically, large areas of these soils were ditched for mosquito control, which has led to marsh degradation in some areas. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon (Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Thirteenth Edition):
Aquic conditions--the zone from 0 to 200 centimeters is continuously saturated (endosaturation)
Fibric soil materials--the zone from 0 to 23 centimeters has a fiber content after rubbing that is three-fourths or more, by volume
Hemic soil materials--the zone from 23 to 84 centimeters has a fiber content after rubbing that is between one-sixth and three-fourths, by volume
Sapric soil materials--the zone from 84 to 107 centimeters has a fiber content after rubbing that is less than one-sixth, by volume
Hypersulfidic materials-the zone from 0 to 200 centimeters has an incubated pH of 4.0 or less in the typical pedon description.
Fluidity--the zone from 107 to 200 centimeters has a fluidity class of very fluid (n value > 1.0)
