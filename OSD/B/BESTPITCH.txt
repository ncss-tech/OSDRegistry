COMPETING SERIES: None

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landscape: Coastal Plain
Landform: Brackish estuarine marshes along tidally influenced rivers and creeks

USE: Mainly as wetland wildlife habitat.

VEGETATION: Native vegetation is dominantly olney threesquare (Scirpus americanus), saltmeadow cordgrass (Spartina patens), saltmarsh cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora), saltgrass (Distichlis spicata) and marsh hibiscus (Hibiscus palustris).

DISTRIBUTION: Coastal Plain of Maryland and Delaware

EXTENT: Moderate

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Dorchester County, Maryland, 1992

REMARKS: These soils were formerly included in the tidal marsh miscellaneous area. They are subject to tidal flooding and become extremely acidic when drained.

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Fibric material--the zone from 0 to 9 inches has a fiber content after rubbing that is three-fourths or more of the soil volume (Oi horizon)
Hemic material--the zone from 9 to 33 inches has a fiber content after rubbing that is between one-sixth and three-fourths of the soil volume (Oe horizon)
Sapric material--the zone from 33 to 42 inches has a fiber content after rubbing that is less than one-sixth of the soil volume (Oa horizon)
Sulfidic materials--more than 0.75 percent sulfur, with less than three times as much carbonate (CaCO3 equivalent) as sulfur, within a depth of 40 inches
High n-value--the zone from 42 to 72 inches has an n-value greater than 1.0, the material flows easily between the fingers

ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data for the typical pedon is available from NSSL, Pedon number S86MD-019-004(1-5).
