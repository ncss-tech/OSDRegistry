BAILEYBORO SERIES

The Baileyboro series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium of Holocene age. These nearly level and very gently sloping soils are on narrow ephemeral streams of draws. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 456 mm (18 in) and mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).
