BORFIN SERIES

The Borfin series consists of moderately deep to duripan, well drained soils that formed in old alluvial deposits over sandstone. Borfin soils are on shoulders of canyons. Slopes are 30 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, mesic Abruptic Argiduridic Durixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Borfin cobbly clay loam- rangeland, on a 19 percent northwest-facing slope at an elevation of 1,550 feet. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. All textures are apparent field textures.)

 A--0 to 7 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) cobbly clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 2 percent stones on the surface, 15 percent cobbles and 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 10 inches thick)

 Bt--7 to 18 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) very cobbly clay, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; strong fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very hard firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and common fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 30 percent cobbles and 20 percent gravel; many prominent clay films on faces of peds; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 11 inches thick)

 Btk--18 to 24 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common fine and medium tubular pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds and in pores; fine irregular filaments of lime; strongly effervescent; 25 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick)

 Bkqm--24 to 34 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) indurated lime-silica cemented duripan, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; few very fine roots on top of horizon; violently effervescent; 20 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 10 inches thick)

 R--34 inches; sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION: Klickitat County, Washington; About 750 feet north and 500 feet east of the southwest corner of section 9, T. 5 N.., R. 22 E.. (Latitude 45 degrees, 55 minutes, 33 seconds N. and Longitude 120 degrees, 04 minutes, 22 seconds W.)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 54 degrees F. Depth to a duripan overlying bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 18 inches and includes part of the argillic horizon. The particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent clay and 35 to 50 percent rock fragments. The argillic horizon has a 20 percent increase, absolute, within a vertical distance of 3 inches. An indurated lime-silica cemented duripan occurs above the bedrock and ranges in thickness from 6 to 10 inches.
The A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.
The Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. Texture is very gravelly clay or very cobbly clay. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.
The Btk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 3 to 5 dry and moist. Texture is clay loam, gravelly clay loam or gravelly clay. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.
The Bkqm horizon has value of 6 to 8 dry. It has many thin discontinuous laminae of silica and carbonates. Rock fragments range from 0 to 20 percent.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing soils.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Borfin soils are on shoulders of canyons at elevations of 400 to 2,900 feet. These soils formed in old alluvial deposits of the Ellensburg formation. Slope is 30 to 50 percent. Summers are hot and dry and winters are cool and moist. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches. The average January temperature is 28 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 72 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 49 to 54 degrees F. The frost-free season is 150 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bakeoven, Cheviot, Mikkalo, and Wipple series. Bakeoven soils are on plateaus and are very shallow. Cheviot and Wipple soils are on canyon side slopes and are very deep. Mikkalo soils are on plateaus and are fine-silty.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; rapid or very rapid runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, sandberg bluegrass, Douglas eriogonum, fleabane and purple sage,.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Klickitat County, Washington; MLRA . The series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Klickitat County, Washington, 2003. Name is coined

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to 18 inches 
Argillic horizon - the zone from 7 to 24 inches 
Duripan - contact at 24 inches. 
An abrupt textural change occurs at 7 inches. 
Particle-size control section - the zone from 7 to 24 inches (Bt and Btk horizons)
This soil is similar to the Manastash series except for the percentage of rock fragments in the control section (skeletal vs. nonskeletal). It was previously correlated as Wipple Variant.
