BIGSAG SERIES

The Bigsag series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium or glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on flood plains or lake plains, typically adjacent to shallow, saline lakes.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, calcareous, frigid Typic Halaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bigsag silty clay, native grass (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted).

    Anyz--0 to 4 inches; olive gray (5Y 4/2) silty clay, gray (5Y 5/1) dry; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine and very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; few fine masses of gypsum and other salts; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick)

    Bnyzg1--4 to 15 inches; olive gray (5Y 4/2) silty clay, gray (5Y 5/1) dry; few fine distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) dry redox concentrations; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common fine seams and masses of gypsum and other salts; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 15 inches thick)

    Bnyzg2--15 to 30 inches; dark gray (5Y 4/1) silty clay, gray (5Y 5/1) dry; common fine distinct grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) dry redox depletions; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common fine seams and masses of gypsum and other salts; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 24 inches thick)

    BCnyzg1--30 to 48 inches; olive gray (5Y 4/2) silty clay, olive gray (5Y 5/2) dry; many fine faint olive (5Y 5/3) dry redox concentrations; massive; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine tubular pores; common fine seams and masses of gypsum and other salts; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 30 inches thick)

    BCnyzg2--48 to 60 inches; dark gray (5Y 4/1) silty clay loam, gray (5Y 6/1) dry; many fine faint olive (5Y 5/3) dry redox concentrations; massive; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine tubular pores; common fine seams and masses of gypsum and other salts; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

COMPETING SERIES:

Lolak (NV) - has redox features that have hue of 10YR, chroma of 2 or less above 40 inches, not strongly saline below 18 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - flood plains or lake plains typically adjacent to shallow saline lakes in old glacial channels.

Elevations - 2,600 to 3,400 feet.

Slopes - 0 to 2 percent.

Parent material - alluvium or glaciolacustrine deposits.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Toole County, Montana, 1991.  Series proposed Chouteau County, Montana, 1987.  Series name is from a glacial channel of the Missouri River locally known as the Big Sag.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1077.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon when mixed to 7 inches (Anyz, Bnyzg1 horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bnyzg1, Bnyzg2, and BCnyzg1 horizons); horizons with redoximorphic features below a depth of 4 inches.  Bigsag soils have a frigid temperature regime and an aquic moisture regime.
