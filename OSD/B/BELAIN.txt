BELAIN SERIES

The Belain series consists of moderately deep, well drained loamy soils that formed in residuum weathered from igneous rock and alluvium or colluvium over bedrock.  These soils are on alluvial fans, hills, bedrock-floored plains, and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Belain loam, grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 4 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many roots; 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick)

    Bw1--4 to 11 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and medium pores; about 10 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary. 

    Bw2--11 to 15 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many pores; about 20 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual wavy boundary. 

    Bw3--15 to 22 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; many pores; about 30 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary. (combined thickness of Bw horizons is 13 to 32 inches thick)

    Bk--22 to 28 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; about 35 percent gravel; few distinct lime coats on underside of gravel; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary. (4 to 14 inches thick)

    R--28 inches; igneous bedrock; fractured in upper few inches, with soil in cracks and few lime coats on fragments.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Belain soils are used mainly for range, dryland farming, and irrigated hayland.  Potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, rough fescue, green needlegrass, needleandthread, prairie junegrass, threadleaf sedge, goldenpea, lupine, and other shrubs and forbs.  Low density stands of ponderosa pine and Douglas fir occur in some areas.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Belain soils are of small extent in the mountains in central Montana.  MLRA's 43B, 44B, 46 and 58A.
