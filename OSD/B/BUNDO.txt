BUNDO SERIES

The Bundo series consists of deep that have moderately rapid permeability and formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from acid intrusive igneous rocks on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 25 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 560 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Palecryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bundo gravelly sandy loam - forested.  (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 8 cm; forest litter.  (3 to 10 cm thick)

    E1--8 to 36 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft, very friable; many fine and coarse roots; common fine pores; 15 percent pebbles; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (20 to 38 cm thick)

    E2--36 to 69 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; strong very fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable; few medium and coarse roots; common fine pores; 35 percent pebbles; strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary. (25 to 64 cm thick)

    EB--69 to 84 cm; (E2) light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable; (Bt) lamellae of light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; lamellae 6 to 25 mm thick; few medium and coarse roots; 45 percent pebbles; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 20 cm thick)

    BE--84 to 150 cm; (Bt) light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist strong fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky, plastic; (E) very pale brown (10YR 7/3) gravelly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable; (E) material occurs in pockets and cracks and as coatings on coarse fragments; 45 percent pebbles; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (50 to 70 cm thick)

   Bt1--150 to 186 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; common fine distinct mottles of brown (7.5YR 4/2), dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate and strong fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky, plastic; common, moderately thick clay films on faces of peds and bridging some coarse particles; about 5 percent by volume of E material is on top of coarse fragments; 50 percent pebbles; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (30 to 46 cm thick)

   Bt2--186 to 247 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely gravelly sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; common fine distinct mottles of brown (7.5YR 4/2), dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; massive; hard, firm, sticky, plastic; common, moderately thick clay films on and bridging coarse fragments; some coarse fragments have very gravelly loam E material on them; 80 percent pebbles; moderately acid.
