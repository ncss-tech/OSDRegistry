Changed mean annual temperature to 11 degrees C. Added C3 horizon to typical pedon using original description. Added in elevation of typical pedon. Added quad and lat/long to type location. In RIC, added in depth to argillic, edited mollic thickness, deleted albic horizon and solum statements, edited clay and sand contents for PSCS to match Bt horizons, and added sand contents to each horizon. Allowed Ap and E horizons to have reaction of neutral. Deleted clay texture class as choice for Bt horizon. Edited the whole competing series section to compete against correct classification of soils. Added elevation to geographic setting and deleted high stream terraces from landform. Deleted Holdrege and Wymore from geographically associated soil because don't occur near type location. Changed permeability to Ksat. Updated saturation statement in Drainage and Ksat section. Added soybeans to crops. Added in LRRs and MLRAs to Distribution and Extent. Deleted albic horizon from diagnostic features because doesn't meet requirements. Changed depth to episaturation from 0 to 24 inches to 6 to 36 inches.


OSD Modification: 8/2012 DJK Changed mean annual soil temperature to 10 to 13 degrees C. Changed lower clay content of PSCS and Bt horizon to 42. Lowered the sand content in PSCS and the Bt horizon from 3 to 2 percent. Removed moderately acid from reaction for the Bt horizon. Added CCE to the BC and C horizons in RIC and added statement on now being Bk horizons. Updated competing series. Changed saturated hydraulic conductivity from low to moderately low. Added precipitation pattern to geographic setting. Edited vertic features depths to appropriate range.
