BADAXE SERIES

The Badaxe series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in sandy loam material underlain by calcareous, loamy till on till plains and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, semiactive, mesic Aquic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Badaxe fine sandy loam, on a 1 percent slope in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 25 cm (10 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) fine sandy loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak coarse granular structure; very friable; many fine roots; 5 percent gravel and cobbles; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. [15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 inches) thick]

 Bw--25 to 38 cm (10 to 15 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) loamy sand; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; few fine roots; 5 percent gravel and cobbles; slightly alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary. [0 to 25 cm (10 inches) thick]

 Bt1--38 to 51 cm (15 to 20 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; thin discontinuous dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay films on faces of some peds; many medium distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions; 10 percent gravel and cobbles; slightly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.

 Bt2--51 to 69 cm (20 to 27 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) sandy loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; few fine roots; thin discontinuous dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay films on vertical and horizontal faces of peds; common medium distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions; 10 percent gravel and cobbles; slightly alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 28 to 56 cm (11 to 22 inches).]

 2Cd1--69 to 91 cm (27 to 36 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) loam; weak thick platy structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; very firm; common medium distinct gray (10YR 6/1) iron depletions; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; 10 percent gravel and cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; diffuse wavy boundary.

 2Cd2--91 to 152 cm (36 to 60 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) loam; weak thick platy structure; very firm; 10 percent gravel and cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Huron County, Michigan; about 2 miles west and 2 miles south of Harbor Beach; 1,100 feet south and 1,545 feet east of the northwest corner of sec. 22, T. 16 N., R. 15 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Thickness of the solum: typically 51 to 76 cm (20 to 30 inches) but ranges from 43 to 102 cm (17 to 40 inches)
Depth to densic contact: 61 to 102 cm (24 to 40 inches)

Ap horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 3 or 4
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: commonly fine sandy loam or less commonly sandy loam, loam, cobbly sandy loam or loamy sand
Rock fragment content: 2 to 14 percent gravel; 0 to 25 percent cobbles
Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline

Bt horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: sandy loam or loam
Rock fragment content: 2 to 14 percent gravel; 0 to 8 percent cobbles
Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline

2Cd horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 5 or 6
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: loam or clay loam
Structure: thick platy structure or is massive
Rock fragment content: 2 to 14 percent gravel; 0 to 8 percent cobbles
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: These are no other series in the same family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Badaxe soils are on till plains and moraines of Wisconsinan Age. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. These soils formed in sandy loam material underlain by calcareous, loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 940 mm (29 to 37 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.2 to 10.0 degrees C (45 to 50 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Shebeon soils and the poorly drained Kilmanagh soils lack the sandy loam layer overlying the loamy till and are commonly nearby.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. The potential for surface runoff is medium or high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and low in the dense till substratum. Permeability is moderate in the solum and very slow in the 2Cd horizon.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. Corn, beans, small grains, sugar beets, and hay are the principal crops.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 99 in the thumb area of lower Michigan. The series is of moderate extent.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 25 cm (10 inches) (Ap horizon).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 38 to 69 cm (15 to 27 inches) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).
