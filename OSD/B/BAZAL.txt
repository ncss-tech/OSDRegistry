BAZAL SERIES

The Bazal series consists of moderately deep, poorly drained soils formed in glacial drift underlain by dense glaciomarine deposits. Bazal soils are in drainageways, valleys, and glacial outwash plains and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 735 millimeters and the average annual temperature is about 9 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Argialbolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Bazal loam, forested, in a level drainageway at 34 meters elevation. When described on October, 21, 2003 the soil was saturated throughout. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bazal soils are in drainageways, valleys, and glacial outwash plains. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. These soils formed in glacial drift underlain by dense glaciomarine deposits. Elevations are 0 to 91 meters. The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and mild moist winters. The annual precipitation ranges from 455 to 1,015 millimeters. The average annual temperature ranges from 9 to 10 degrees C. The frost-free period is about 200 to 240 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Deadmanbay, Killebrew, Mitchellbay, Shalcar, and Sholander soils. Deadmanbay soils have a densic contact at 100 to 150 cm and do not have aquic conditions in the upper 20 cm. Killebrew and Mitchellbay soils are in higher elevation positions within valleys and outwash plains and do not have aquic conditions in the upper 20 cm. Shalcar soils are in drainageways and depressions and are Histosols. Sholander soils are in drainageways and valleys, have a sandy particle-size control section, and do not have aquic conditions in the upper 20 centimeters. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high to very high in the upper part (A, Bw and E horizons) and low to moderately low in the lower part (Btg and Cd horizons). Bazal soils have a perched water table as high as 0 cm from October to April, 26 cm in May, and 60 cm in June, unless the soil is drained. Bazal soils are subject to frequent ponding for very long durations from December to March and for brief durations during October, November, and April. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for timber production, watershed, and wildlife habitat. Potential natural vegetation consists of Sitka spruce, red alder, lodgepole pine, clustered rose, salmonberry, trailing blackberry, red elderberry, common snowberry, stinging nettle, swordfern, slough sedge, field horsetail, and scouring-rush horsetail. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Puget Sound valleys in Northwest Washington; 
MLRA 2, Northern Part. Series is of small extent.
