Slope: 0 to 1 percent
Mean annual precipitation range: 635 to 940 mm (25 to 37 in)
Precipitation pattern: June through August and December through February are the driest months.  These soils are intermittently moist in September through November and March through May.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Aransas (TX), Degola (TX), Meguin (TX) and Sinton soils.  
Aransas soils: occur at elevations lower than 4.6 m (15 ft) on a similar landform  
Degola and Sinton soils: have a fine-loamy particle-size control section; occur on a slightly higher position on a similar landform 
Meguin soils: have a fine-silty particle-size control section; occur on a slightly higher position on a similar landform.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Permeability is very slow.  Water enters the soil rapidly when it is cracked and dry and very slow when it is wet.  Runoff is low.  The soil is occasionally or frequently flooded for very brief periods throughout the year.   

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major uses are for crop production of grain sorghum, wheat, corn or cotton.  Native vegetation consists of bluestems, paspalums and panicums.  Trees include pecan, elm, and hackberry. Ecological site name is Clayey Bottomland 20-35" PZ (R083AY380TX).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Rio Grande Plain; LRR I; MLRA 83A; moderate extent.
