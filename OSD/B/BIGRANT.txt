BIGRANT SERIES  

The Bigrant series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained  soils that formed in alluvium.  They are on flood plains and stream terraces.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous Calcic Cryaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bigrant silty clay loam, pasture--on a 1 percent slightly  concave slope at 5,200 feet elevation.  When described on September 28, 1987, the soil was moist to 19 inches and wet below with ground water at 29 inches.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  

    Oi--0 to 4 inches; slightly decomposed grass.  (0 to 5 inches thick)  

    Ak1--4 to 14 inches; gray (10YR 6/1) silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, and common medium  roots; common very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent (20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 12 inches thick)  

    Ak2--14 to 23 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular  blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly  plastic; common fine, very fine and few medium roots; common very fine  and fine tubular pores; violently effervescent (25 percent calcium  carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick)  

    Bkg1--23 to 29 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; many large prominent iron concentrations, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; hard, firm, sticky and  plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; many very fine and common fine tubular pores; sand sized soft lime nodules common  throughout; violently effervescent (26 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); gradual wavy boundary.  

    Bkg2--29 to 33 inches; light gray (5Y 7/2) clay loam, olive  (5Y 5/3) moist; many large distinct iron accumulations, gray (5Y 5/1) moist;  moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine  granular; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few very fine and fine roots;  common very fine and fine tubular pores; 20 percent of soil material is soft segregated lime; violently effervescent (20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bkg horizon is 8 to 18 inches.)  

    Bg--33 to 40 inches; light olive gray (5Y 6/2) loam,  olive gray (5Y 4/2) moist; common large prominent iron accumulations, dark greenish gray (5BG 4/1) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure  parting to moderate fine granular; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few  very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick)  

    Cg--40 to 64 inches; pale olive (5Y 6/3) loam, greenish gray (5G 5/1) moist; common large prominent iron accumulations, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) moist; massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky and  plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular  pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1).

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Thosand series.  Thosand soils have contrasting sand and gravel at 40 to 60 inches.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bigrant soils are on flood plains and stream terraces at elevations of 4,800 to 6,400 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  These soils formed in silty alluvium.  The climate is cold and moist in winter and  spring and cool in summer.  The average annual precipitation is 8 to 13  inches.  The average annual air temperature is 36 to 42 degrees F.  The  frost-free season is 35 to 55 days.  

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dickeypeak and the competing Thosand soils.  Dickeypeak soils are on fan  terraces and stream terraces, are somewhat poorly drained and have coarse-loamy textural control sections.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly and very poorly drained.  Slow  runoff.  Moderately slow permeability.  Occasional flooding for brief periods April through September.  

USE AND VEGETATION:  Pastureland.  The natural vegetation is inland saltgrass, tufted hairgrass, sedge, basin wildrye and slender wheatgrass.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East central Idaho.  These soils are not  extensive.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  

Mollic epipedon - The zone from 4 to 14 inches (Ak1, Ak2 horizons); dry value is waved because of over 15 percent calcium carbonate.  

Calcic horizon - The zone from 14 to 33 inches (Ak2, Bkg1, and Bkg2 horizons).  

Particle-size control section - The zone from 14 to 44 inches (Ak2, Bkg1, Bkg2, Bg horizons, and part of the Cg horizon).  

ADDITIONAL DATA:  This pedon was sampled by the NSSL, Lincoln, NE, Sample Number S87ID-037-005.
