BOLEY SERIES

The Boley series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in loamy and clayey alluvial sediments of recent age.  These nearly level to slightly concave soils are on flood plains of the Cherokee Prairies (MLRA 112).  Mean annual precipitation is 102 centimeters (40 inches).  Mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C. (61 degrees F).  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.

Mason soils have a mollic epipedon, have a argillic horizon, are well drained, and occur on higher flood plains. 
Norwood soils are calcareous, well drained, and occur on higher flood plains.
Oklared soils have a coarse-loamy control section, are calcareous, are well drained, and occur on higher flood plains. 
Roebuck soils have a mollic epipedon, more than 35 percent clay content in the control section, and occurs on similar areas. 
Severn soils have less than 18 percent clay content in the control section, are well drained, are calcareous, and occur on higher flood plains. 
Wynona soils have a mollic epipedon and occur on higher flood plains.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage: poorly drained
Runoff: very high
Saturated hydraulic conductivity:   moderately high
Flucuating perched water table: 30 to 122 centimeters (1 to 4 feet) mainly during the winter and spring months and generally no water table above 203 centimeters (80 inches) during the summer and fall
Pond water frequently on the surface for brief to long periods during the winter and spring
Flooding: frequently flooded for very brief or brief periods

USE AND VEGETATION:  Boley soils are used for native range, forest or wildlife. Native vegetation is bottomland hardwoods with an under story of tall grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Boley soils are not extensive.
