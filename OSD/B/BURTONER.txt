BURTONER SERIES 

The Burtoner series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium and residuum derived from granite and other coarse grained igneous rocks.  These soils are on hills, ridges and escarpments.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Burtoner sandy clay loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 8 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine and fine and few medium pores; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.3); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 8 inches thick) 

    Bt1--8 to 14 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine and few fine tubular and interstitial pores; many faint clay films bridging sand grains and common faint clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear wavy boundary. 

    Bt2--14 to 23 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine and few fine tubular and interstitial pores; many faint clay films bridging sand grains and common faint clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.3); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of Bt horizons is 8 to 24 inches). 

    Cr--23 to 28 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) decomposed granite bedrock (grus) that crushes to very gravelly loamy coarse sand; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Burtoner soils are primarily used for rangeland, woodland and wildlife habitat.  The potential native vegetation is mainly  rough fescue, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, fringed sagewort, sticky geranium, Rocky Mountain juniper, bitterbrush and big sagebrush.  Areas with a forest canopy have an overstory of ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, limber pine, and an understory of Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass and Rocky Mountain juniper. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Burtoner soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana. MLRA 43B.
