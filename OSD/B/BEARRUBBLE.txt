BEARRUBBLE SERIES


The Bearrubble series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in tephra over residuum from basalt and or basaltic andesite. Bearrubble soils are on shield volcanoes in the Southern Cascade mountains. Slopes range from 5 to 40 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches (1143 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F (5 degrees C).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bearrubble soils are on shield volcanoes in the Southern Cascade mountains. Slopes are 5 to 40 percent. These soils formed in tephra over residuum from basalt and or basaltic andesite. Elevation is 5455 to 8052 feet (1663 to 2455 m). Mean annual precipitation is 33 to 83 inches (838 to 2108 mm). The mean annual temperature is 41 to 44 degrees F (5 to 6.6 degrees C). Frost free season is 50 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Juniperlake and Scoured soils. The Juniperlake soils are deep to dense till and are on moraines. The Scoured soils are moderately deep to lithic bedrock and occur on glaciated headlands.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; saturated hydraulic conductivity is high to very high in the A and C horizons, and moderately high to high in the 2Bwb horizon.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for wildlife habitat, recreation, ecosystem management and watershed. Vegetation is pinemat manzanita, white fir, bush chinquapin, California red fir and western white pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The soils are inextensive and are mapped in MLRA: 22B Southern Cascade mountains
