BERVILLE SERIES

The Berville series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in glaciofluvial deposits overlying till on lake plains and ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C (49 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, semiactive, mesic Typic Argiaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Berville loam, on a 1 percent slope in a cultivated field on a till plain. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 20 cm (8 inches); black (10YR 2/1) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; friable; many fine and medium roots; about 6 percent gravel; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [20 to 30 cm (8 to 12 inches) thick]

 A--20 to 28 cm (8 to 11 inches); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; moderate coarse granular structure; friable; many fine and medium roots; about 10 percent gravel; neutral; gradual wavy boundary. [0 to 13 cm (5 inches) thick)]

 Btg1--28 to 41 cm (11 to 16 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; firm; many fine roots; few faint clay films; coatings of very dark brown (10YR 2/2) on most peds; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; about 18 percent gravel; neutral; gradual wavy boundary. [8 to 18 cm (3 to 7 inches) thick]

 Btg2--41 to 76 cm (16 to 30 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; many fine roots; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) and distinct olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) masses of oxidized iron; about 20 percent gravel; slightly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. [25 to 46 cm (10 to 18 inches) thick]

 Btg3--76 to 91 cm (30 to 36 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly clay loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; firm; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; few fine roots; common coarse faint brown (10YR 4/3) and prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; about 20 percent gravel; slightly alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary. [0 to 30 cm (12 inches) thick]

 2Cg--91 to 152 cm (36 to 60 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; firm; few medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; about 2 percent gravel and 1 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Berville soils are on nearly level areas and depressions of ground moraines and lake plains of Wisconsinan Age. Slope ranges from 0 to about 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 914 mm (30 to 36 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 10.0 degrees C (48 to 50 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The well drained Kendallville, moderately well drained Cadmus and somewhat poorly drained Macomb soils are in a drainage sequence with Berville soils. Other associates are the Brookston soils where the outwash is thinner and the Matherton and Sebewa soils where the gravelly outwash is thicker.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between November and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate in the outwash and moderately slow in the till.

USE AND VEGETATION: The greater part is drained and is under cultivation. The principal crops are corn, small grains, soybeans, navy beans, and hay. A small part is in permanent pasture or forest. The native forest vegetation is American elm, white ash, red maple, and swamp white oak.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 98 and 99 in southern Michigan. This series is of moderate extent.
