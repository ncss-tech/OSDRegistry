BEEFHOLLOW SERIES

The Beefhollow series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from andesite.  Beefhollow soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 20 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, smectitic, frigid Typic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Beefhollow loam, on a north facing, linear to concave, 58 percent slope in Gambel oak at an elevation of 5,707 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The surface is covered by 5 percent gravel of andesite origin and subangular in shape.

    A--0 to 6 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine and very fine granular; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine and few fine tubular and interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 14 inches thick)

    Bt1--6 to 16 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine, few fine and medium roots; many very fine and common fine tubular and interstitial pores; common patchy distinct clay films on ped faces 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary. 

    Bt2--16 to 21 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and fine subangular blocky; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and medium, few fine roots; many very fine and few fine tubular pores; many patchy prominent clay films on ped faces: 10 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary.

    Bt3--21 to 35 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and fine subangular blocky; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and medium, few fine roots; many very fine and few fine tubular pores; common patchy distinct clay films on ped faces; 10 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary.

    Bt4--35 to 44 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common medium, few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and few fine tubular pores; few patchy faint clay films on ped faces; 25 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (total thickness of Bt horizons - 20 to 50 inches)

    C--44 to 60 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; 25 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).
