BURFORD SERIES

The Burford series consists of deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in calcareous loamy material overlying silty redbeds. These soils are on gently sloping to steep summits and side slopes within the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78). Slope ranges from 1 to 20 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is 660 mm (26 in).
