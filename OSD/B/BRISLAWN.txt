BRISLAWN SERIES

The Brislawn series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium or eolian deposits over weathered porcelanite.  The soils are moderately deep to fragmental material.  Brislawn soils are on fans remnants, terraces, broad ridges and on plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bleumont, Jaywest and Spottedhorse series. These soils do not have fragmental material within depths of 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Brislawn soils are on fans remnants, terraces, broad ridges and plateaus.  They formed in alluvium or eolian deposits over weathered porcelanite or very channery slopewash derived from porcelanite.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 3,800 to 5,300 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 17 inches, half of which falls as rain or snow from late March through June.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 105 to 130 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Deekay, Ironbutte, Moorhead and Muleherder soils.  Deekay soils are fine-loamy and do not have fragmental material within depths of 40 inches.  Ironbutte soils do not have argillic horizons and are shallow to fragmental material consisting of porcelanite.  Moorhead soils are fine and do not have fragmental material within depths of 40 inches.  Muleherder soils do not have argillic horizons. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; runoff is negligible to high depending on slope; moderately slow or slow over rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are utilized for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is mainly western wheatgrass, needleandthread, blue grama and green needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Wyoming.  The series is of small extent.
