BRISTON SERIES

The Briston series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium on remnant outwash terraces and alluvial fans in intermountain valleys and uplands. These soils are between mima mounds.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Ustollic Haplocryalfs

    Bt3--29 to 39 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) extremely gravelly sandy clay loam, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist; strong medium angular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common distinct patchy clay films on faces of peds; few very fine and fine roots; few medium tubular pores; 5 percent cobbles and 60 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of Bt horizons 20 to 40 inches)

    C--39 to 60 inches; reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/6) extremely gravelly loamy sand, reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) moist; single grain; loose, non-sticky and non-plastic; few very fine roots; 10 percent cobbles and 60 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4).
