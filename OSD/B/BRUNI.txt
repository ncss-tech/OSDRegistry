BRUNI SERIES

The Bruni series consists of deep to a petrocalcic horizon, well drained, moderately permeable soils. These soils formed in eolian and non-calcareous loamy alluvium over calcareous loamy residuum and petrocalcics of the Goliad Formation. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils occur on broad, low ridges on inland, dissected coastal plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 584 mm (23 in). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, hyperthermic Petrocalcic Paleustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Bruni loamy fine sand, on an east facing, 1.0 percent slope in rangeland; elevation is 172.5 m (566 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

(23 to 51 cm [9 to 20 in] thick)                      

    Bt1--39to 64 cm (15 to 25 in); yellowish red (5YR 5/6) fine sandy loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6), moist; 12 percent clay; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; 30 percent sidtinct clay films on all faces of peds; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. (15 to 51 cm [6 to 20 in]).

     Bt2--64 to 104 cm, (25 to 41 in); red (2.5YR 4/8) sandy clay loam, red (2.5YR 4/6), moist; 22 percent clay; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky, moderately plastic; 40 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 5 percent fine distinct irregular masses of oxidized iron with diffuse boundaries in matrix; noneffervescent; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. (30 to 80 cm [12 to 31 in] thick)

    Bkkm--104 to 203 cm, (41 to 80 in); white (10YR 9.5/1) cemented material; strongly cemented calcium carbonate, becoming less cemented and massive with depth; thick, platy, indurated, finely laminated cap in the upper part; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline.

Runoff: negligible on slopes less than 1 percent and low on slopes of 1 to 3 percent

USE AND VEGETATION: Used predominantly for wildlife habitat and livestock grazing. About 20 percent is for dry-land crop production of cotton, grain sorghum, watermelon, and forage production. A few areas are irrigated and produce such crops as citrus, cotton, sorghums, and winter vegetables. Principal grasses of uncultivated areas include Arizona cottontop, lovegrass tridens, plains bristlegrass and pink pappusgrass. Woody vegetation includes mesquite, catclaw, lime pricklyash, desert yaupon, and pricklypear.
