BAUSCHER SERIES

The Bauscher series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils on fan terraces, foothills, and mountains.  They formed in alluvium and colluvium from intermediate intrusive rocks.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the average annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Ultic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bauscher loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A1--0 to 7 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak thin platy structure parting to weak fine granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; many very fine interstitial pores; slightly acid (pH 6.1); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 9 inches thick)

    A2--7 to 14 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium, common coarse roots; many fine and medium pores; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 9 inches thick)

    Bt1--14 to 24 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and fine angular blocky; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, common medium tubular pores; few thin clay films on all faces of peds; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 14 inches thick)

    Bt2--24 to 36 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and coarse angular blocky; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, few medium roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; many thin clay films on all faces of peds; slightly acid (pH 6.1); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 14 inches thick)

    Bt3--36 to 49 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) coarse sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak very coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and coarse angular blocky; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; few thin clay films on all faces of peds; slightly acid (pH 6.3); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 15 inches thick)

    C--49 to 62 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) coarse sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.5); gradual irregular boundary.

TYPE LOCATION:  Camas County, Idaho; about 3 miles north and 1.5 miles west of Hill City; 2,300 feet east and 200 feet south of the northwest corner of section 18, T.1 S., R.12 E.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Brinegar, Bringmee, DeMasters, Oldbutte (T), Pinehurst, and Watchabob series.  Brinegar soils are moderately well drained.  Bringmee soils have 15 to 30 percent fine sand and coarser in the upper part of the argillic and have a significant amount of volcanic ash.  DeMasters and Pinehurst soils have "O" horizons.  Oldbutte soils have dominantly fine and very fine sands in the sand fraction and are dry less than 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Pinehurst soils have 5YR hue.  Watchabob soils are moderately deep to bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bauscher soils are on fan terraces, foothills, and mountains.  Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent.  Elevations are 4,500 to 7,100 feet.  These soils formed in alluvium, colluvium, and residuum weathered from intermediate intrusive rocks.  The average annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches, most of which falls as snow and early spring rain.  The average annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Earcree,
Moonstone (T), Riceton, Roanhide, and Simonton soils.  Earcree soils have a cryic temperature regime.  Earcree, Moonstone, Riceton, and Roanhide soils have less than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Moonstone and Roanhide soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Simonton soils lack an over thickened A horizon.  Earcree, Moonstone, and Roanhide soils occur on mountainsides.  Riceton and Simonton soils occur on similar landscapes as the Bauscher soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to very rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Bauscher soils are used mainly for nonirrigated hay and small grains, rangeland, and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation in the potential natural plant community is dominantly bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, and mountain big sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central and southwestern Idaho.  These soils are moderately extensive.
