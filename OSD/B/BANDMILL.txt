BANDMILL SERIES

The Bandmill series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess over basalt residuum with a thin mantle of volcanic ash.  They are on hills and structural benches of lava plateaus.  Permeability is moderately slow and slopes range from 5 to 45 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Brequito (T), Riswold (T) and Scaler (T) series.  Brequito soils have 3BC and 3C horizons with textures of loam and sandy loam.  Riswold soils have more than 25 percent rock fragments in the 3Bt horizons.  Scaler soils are paramicaceous in the lower subsoil.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bandmill soils are on hills and structural benches on lava plateaus at elevations of 1,600 to 3,450 feet.  Slopes are 5 to 45 percent.  The soils formed in loess over basalt residuum with a thin mantle of volcanic ash.  The average annual temperature is 41 to 44 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is 30 to 50 inches.  The frost free season is 50 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Aldermand (T), Elkridge (T), Grangemont (T) and Riswold (T) series.  Aldermand soils are on canyon and mountain slopes, are coarse-loamy and have vitrandic properties.  Elkridge soils are on hills and canyon slopes and are loamy-skeletal.  Grangemont soils are on hills and have fragic characteristics.  Riswold soils are on low hills and structural benches and have more than 25 percent rock fragments in the lower argillic.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, wildlife habitat, recreation and watershed. Potential natural vegetation is western redcedar, grandfir, western larch, Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine with an understory of queencup beadlilly, goldthread, bunchberry dogwood, starry false Solomons seal, sweetscented bedstraw, American trailplant, western thimbleberry, Rocky Mountain maple and common snowberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North central Idaho.  Bandmill soils are not extensive.
