BULLFLAT SERIES

The Bullflat series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy alluvium or colluvium from sedimentary sources.  Bullflat soils are on backslope and footslope positions on fans, terraces, benches, lower hillslopes, and in valleys in mountains.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 508 cm (20 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.5 degrees C (44 degrees F).

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing, hayland and pasture, wildlife habitat, and recreation. Native vegetation is western wheatgrass, junegrass, green needlegrass, blue grama, needleandthread, and sedges. When utilized as hayland and pasture, cultivars of alfalfa, smooth brome, and intermediate wheatgrass are common.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Black Hills of western South Dakota and northeastern Wyoming, especially on the low limestone plateau physiographic area; LRR G, MLRA 62. The series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Salina, Kansas

SERIES ESTABLISHED: soil Survey of Custer and Pennington Counties, Black Hills Parts, South Dakota, 1985.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 inches); (Ap, Bt1 horizons)
Argillic horizon - 15 to 53 cm (6 to 21 inches); (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons)
Secondary accumulations of calcium carbonate - 53 to 81 cm (21 to 32 inches); (Bk, Ck horizons)

The taxonomic class/soil moisture regime is changed from udic to ustic with this update.  The type location for the series, and the majority of the mapped extent, is in the ustic moisture zone in MLRA 62.
