SERIES ESTABLISHED: Franklin County, Virginia, 2004

REMARKS: Bluemount soils were formerly recognized in the Spriggs series.  The soil horizon depths were revised on 10/2021 to ensure the description began at the soil surface.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 5 inches (Oi and A horizon)
Argillic horizon - the zone from 5 to 25 inches (Bt horizons)
Lithic contact - 25 inches (R horizon)

ADDITIONAL DATA: Typical pedon sampled as S98VA-067-002. Additional reference sample is S98VA-067-001.
