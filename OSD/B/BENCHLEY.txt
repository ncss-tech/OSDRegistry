BENCHLEY SERIES

The Benchley series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils derived from residuum weathered from clayey residuum of the Cook Mountain Formation.  These nearly level to moderately sloping soils are on ridges on dissected plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent but are dominantly 1 to 3 percent.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Caradan (TX), Durant (OK), Flatonia (TX), and Foraker (OK) series in the same family. Similar soils are the Blum, Bonham, Culp, Elmendorf, and Hallettsville series.  
Caradan soils: calcic horizons; do not have redoximorphic features due to wetness in the argillic horizon.  
Durant and Foraker soils: lower mean annual temperature; a shorter growing season.  In addition, Foraker soils have Cr horizons between 51 to 102 cm (20 and 40 in).
Flatonia soils: Cr horizon between 102 and 152 cm (40 and 60 in)
Blum and Culp soils: mixed mineralogy.
Bonham soils: udic moisture regime.
Elmendorf soils: moist in the moisture control section for longer periods; hyperthermic soil temperature regime
Hallettsville soils: an abrupt textural change between the A and Bt horizons (Pale).

Bremond, Mabank, and Wilson soils: have an ochric epipedon; on slightly lower terrace positions commonly near drainageways.  
Crockett and Dimebox soils: on similar landscape positions or on slightly higher convex positions.  These soils do not have mollic epipedons.  Also, the Dimebox series is clayey throughout and has large slickensides.

USE AND VEGETATION: Typically cultivated crops are cotton, grain sorghum, corn and small grain.  Bermudagrass pastures are common.  Native vegetation includes little bluestem, big bluestem, Indiangrass, brownseed paspalum and various forbes.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The Blackland Prairies of East Central Texas (MLRA 86B). The series is of moderate extent.
