BLOOMCREEK SERIES

The Bloomcreek series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in mixed alluvium. These soils are on flood plains. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 381 mm and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bloomcreek soils are on linear to slightly convex positions on flood plains. Elevations are 1800 to 2050 m. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. These soils formed in mixed alluvium. The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm, dry summers. Mean annual precipitation is 330 to 560 mm, much of which falls as snow or spring rain. Mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C. Frost-free period is 70 to 90 days.
 
GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Blackotter, Hades, Lanoak, Marshdale, and Nuffer soils.  Blackotter soils have a coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal particle size control section, have free carbonates to the surface and occupy similar landform positions.  Hades soils are well drained, have a fine-loamy particle size control section and are on footslopes.  Lanoak soils are well drained, have a fine-silty particle size control section and are on footslopes.  Marshdale soils have a cumulic, mollic epipedon and occupy slightly concave positions. Nuffer soils have a loamy-skeletal particle size control section, have free carbonates to the surface and occupy similar landform positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained, Moderate permeability to a depth of 97 cm and rapid below.
 
USE AND VEGETATION: Bloomcreek soils are used for pasture and wildlife habitat. Potential native vegetation is sedge, slender wheatgrass, tufted hairgrass, basin wildrye, clover, and western wheatgrass.
 
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Bloomcreek soils are of small extent in southeastern Idaho. MLRA 13.
