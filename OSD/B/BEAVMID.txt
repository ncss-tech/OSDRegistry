BEAVMID SERIES

The Beavmid series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived metamorphic and sedimentary rock.  These soils are on fan remnants and outwash terraces.  Slopes are 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 1 degree C.
