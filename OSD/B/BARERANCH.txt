BARERANCH SERIES

The Bareranch series consists of deep to soft tuff, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium from volcanic rocks, high in pyroclastic materials. Bareranch soils are on beach terraces on hills. Slopes are 8 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-skeletal, glassy, mesic Vitritorrandic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Bareranch very stony ashy sandy loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is partly covered with 15 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones.

(8 to 12 inches thick)

 C--29 to 42 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very cobbly ashy sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine interstitial and tubular pores; 20 percent igneous gravel and 20 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.3); abrupt wavy boundary.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bareranch soils are on beach terraces on hills. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from volcanic rocks, high in pyroclastic materials. Slopes are 8 to 30 percent. Elevations are 4,500 to 5,500 feet. The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches; mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Devada, Coppersmith (T NV), Nevadash (T NV) and Saraph.  Devada soils are shallow to hard volcanic rock.  Coppersmith soils have durinodes and have ashy particle-size class.  Nevadash soils are very deep, lack a mollic epipedon and have durinodes.  Saraph soils are shallow over tuff.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Rangeland and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, Thurber's needlegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass and antelope bitterbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Washoe County, Nevada and eastern Lassen County, California.  MLRA 23. These soils are not extensive.
