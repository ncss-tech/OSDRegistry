Texla soils: have a yellower argillic horizon; on oblong mounds and relict point bars on the coastal plain. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is slow.  Runoff is very high.  

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for timber.  Some areas are in pasture of improved bermudagrass or bahiagrass.  Loblloy and shotleaf pine are dominant woodland trees with many oak species and other hardwoods.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES PROPOSED: Newton County, Texas, 2011, MLRA 152B soil survey area. The name is for a town in Jasper County, Texas.

REMARKS: The series was established during the update of MLRA 152B. These soils were previously mapped as the Spurger series but do not classify the same as Spurger.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle size control section: 33 to 83 cm (13 to 33 in).  (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons) 

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 33 cm (0 to 13 in).  (A and E horizons) 

Argillic horizon: 33 to 203 cm (13 to 80 in).  (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, and Btg horizons)

Vertic features: The presence of pressure faces at 33 to 117 cm (13 to 46 in) (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)

ADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL data on pedon number 08N0165 from the series type location. Addition laboratory data from the MLRA 150 Soil Survey Office on three other sites.
