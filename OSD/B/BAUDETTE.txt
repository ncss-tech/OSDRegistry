BAUDETTE SERIES

The Baudette series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits. These soils are on glacial lake plains and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 600 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Oxyaquic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Baudette fine sandy loam, on a convex slope of 2 percent, on a glacial lake plain, in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Ap--0 to 15 centimeters; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) fine sandy loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; very friable; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. (15 to 23 centimeters thick)

    E--15 to 30 centimeters; brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam; weak fine granular structure; very friable; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 25 centimeters thick)

    Bt1--30 to 48 centimeters; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silty clay loam; strong medium angular blocky structure; firm; many continuous faint brown (10YR 4/3) clay films on faces of peds and in pores; neutral; clear smooth boundary.

    Bt2--48 to 66 centimeters; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few discontinuous faint brown (10YR 4/3) clay films on faces of peds and in pores; few fine distinct light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) redoximorphic depletions in the lower part; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizon ranges 10 to 76 centimeters.)

    Bk--66 to 104 centimeters; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) silt loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; few to common soft accumulations of carbonates; few fine distinct light gray (2.5Y 7/2) redoximorphic depletions and few fine distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) redoximorphic concentrations; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 51 centimeters thick)

    C--104 to 152 centimeters; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) silt loam; massive; very friable; common fine distinct light gray (2.5Y 7/2) redoximorphic depletions and few fine distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) redoximorphic concentrations; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Major Land resource Area (MLRA) 88-Norhtern Minnesota Glacial Lake Basins; Lake of the Woods County, Minnesota; about 1 mile south of Pitt; 1,100 feet west and 2,000 feet north of the southeast corner, section 2, T. 160 N., R. 32 W.; USGS Pitt, Minnesota topographic quadrangle; latitude 48 degrees 42 minutes 19 seconds N., and longitude 94 degrees 43 minutes 5 seconds W., NAD83.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Moranville series. 
Moranville soils--have a lithologic discontinuity in the upper third of the series control section

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--lacustrine deposits
Landform--glacial lake plains or moraines
Slope--0 to 6 percent
Elevation--300 to 500 meters
Mean annual air temperature--4 to 6 degrees C.
Mean annual precipitation--500 to 700 millimeters
Frost free period--90 to 120 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Debs, Littleswan, Sax and Spooner soils. Debs soils are well drained and are on more sloping areas. Littleswan soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on lower lying less sloping areas. Spooner soils are poorly drained and are on lower lying level slopes. Sax soils are very poorly drained and are in depressions. Organic soils are common associates in some places.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--moderately well drained--these soils have a frequently saturated zone occurring between depths of 61 and 76 centimeters during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean annual precipitation
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--4.0 to 42.0 micrometers per second

USE AND VEGETATION: About half of these soils are cultivated. The common crops are wheat, barley, oats, and legumes for forage and seed production. Native vegetation is mixed deciduous and coniferous forest. The deciduous trees primarily are quaking aspen and paper birch. The conifers are red and white pine, white spruce, and balsam fir.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Physiographic Division--Interior Plains or Laurentian Upland
Physiographic Province--Central Lowland or Superior Upland 
MLRA--Northern Minnesota Glacial Lake Basins (88)
LRR--K; Northern Minnesota
Extentmoderately extensive
