BACHUS SERIES

The Bachus series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium weathered from quartzitic sandstone. Bachus soils are on anticlines along mountain fronts and have slopes of 2 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Pachic Argicryolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Bachus loam-grassland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A1--0 to 13 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; strong fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 18 inches thick)

    A2--13 to 17 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure that parts to strong fine granular; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual smooth boundary. (3 to 5 inches thick)

    Bt1--17 to 26 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure that parts to moderate medium subangular blocky; very hard, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; common faint clay films on faces of peds and in root channels and pores; moderately acid (pH 5.8); gradual smooth boundary. (3 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt2--26 to 31 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure that parts to moderate medium subangular blocky; very hard, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few medium roots; common faint clay films on faces of peds and in root channels and pores; 10 percent sandstone fragments; moderately acid (pH 5.7); gradual wavy boundary. (3 to 7 inches thick)

    R--31 inches; hard, noncalcareous, quartzitic sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION: Johnson County, Wyoming; NE1/4, NE1/4 of Sec. 30, T. 45 N., R. 85 W. Tabletop Quad, 43 degrees 50 minutes 39 seconds north latitude and 107 degrees 6 minutes 35 seconds west longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon is 16 to 30 inches thick. Depth to the lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Organic carbon in the mollic epipedon ranges from 1 to 4 percent and decreases uniformly with depth. The soils are 60 to 90 percent base saturated. Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in the particle size control section but range as high as 25 percent in Colorado.. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 39 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature from 50 to 58 degrees F.

The A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3. This horizon is neutral through moderately acid.

The Bt horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 3 through 6 dry, 2 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4. It is loam or clay loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay, 25 to 50 percent silt, and 20 to 50 percent sand with less than 35 percent but more than 15 percent being fine sand or coarser. Oriented clay films occur in some parts of this horizon. This horizon is neutral through moderately acid. Some pedons may have thin C horizons above the bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bavdark, Benteen, Cambern, Clayburn, Croydon, Crystalbutte, Davtone Decross, Dehana,(T) Demast, Dranburn, Dranyon, Echemoor, Gordo, Hagenbarth, Millerlake, Pontuge, Senchert, Southmount(T), Poodle, Stubbs, Thulepah, Vadnais, and Winu series. Benteen, Senchert, and Poodle soils are neutral or slightly alkaline. Cambern soils formed in materials from ash and tuff and overlies tuff or ash. Bavdark, Clayburn, Croydon, Crystalbutte, Davtone, Decross, Dehana, Demast, Dranburn, Dranyon, Gordo, Hagenbarth, Millerlake, Pontuge, Southmount, and Thulepah soils lack bedrock at depths of less than 40 inches. Dranyon soils also have a solum 40 to 60 inches thick and have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the solum. Echemoor Poodle and Stubbs soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Vadnais soils formed in loess over basalt. Winu soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from igneous rock and have summer soil temperature of 58 or 59 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bachus soils are on anticlines along mountain fronts. Elevation is 6,800 to 9,000 feet. Slope is 2 to 25 percent. The soils formed in noncalcareous alluvium weathered from underlying quartzitic sandstone. The average annual precipitation is 15 to 25 inches. The mean annual temperature is about 33 to 44 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is about 48 to 56 degrees F. The frost-free season is less than 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Decross and Sawcreek soils. Decross soils lack bedrock at depths of less than 40 inches and have continuous horizons of carbonate accumulations. Sawcreek soils have mollic epipedons 7 to 15 inches thick and lack argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, medium runoff on lower slopes, rapid runoff on steeper slopes; moderate
permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for range, recreation, and wildlife. Native vegetation is green needlegrass, Idaho fescue, and yarrow.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mountains of Wyoming. The series is of moderate extent.
