BRENNAN SERIES

The Brennan series consists of very deep, well drained soils.  These nearly level to gently undulating soils formed in loamy eolian sands and calcareous loamy alluvium on vegetated sand sheet plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 508 mm (20 in).
