BARLING SERIES

The Barling series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in silty alluvium derived from siltstone, sandstone and shale.  These soils are on level to nearly level flood plains in Boston Mountains and Arkansas River Valley.  Near the type location, the average annual temperature is about 61 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 37 inches.
Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, active, thermic Fluvaquentic Dystrudepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Barling silt loam in pasture.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

     Ap--0 to 5 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam; weak fine granular structure; friable; many fine roots; few fine pores; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

     A--5 to 11 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam; weak fine granular structure; friable; many fine roots; few fine pores; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 8 inches thick)

     BA--11 to 19 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine roots; few fine pores; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 9 inches thick)

    Bw1--19 to 26 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common medium faint grayish brown (10YR 5/2) Fe depletions; common fine roots; few fine pores; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.

    Bw2--26 to 36 inches; about 60 percent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) and about 40 percent grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; common fine pores; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.

    Bw3--36 to 54 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silt loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common coarse distinct gray (10YR 6/1) Fe depletions;  few fine roots; common fine pores; strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.

    Bw4--54 to 72 inches; about 55 percent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) and about 45 percent gray (10YR 6/1) silt loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few roots; common fine pores; strongly acid.  (Combined thickness of the Bw horizon ranges from 35 to more 56 inches.)

TYPE LOCATION:  Sebastian County, Arkansas; 200 feet north of south boundary of Fort Chaffee, 75 feet west of Vache Grasse Creek.  SE1/4SE1/4SE1/4 Sec. 21, T. 7 N., R. 31 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  The soil reaction ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid in the A and BA or AB horizons and slightly acid to very strongly acid in the Bw horizon.  Depth to horizons with redox depletions of chroma 2 or less ranges from 10 to 24 inches.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 2, 3 or 4, or value of 5, and chroma of 3.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.

The AB or BA horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam, loam or very fine sandy loam.

The Bw1 horizon has hue of 10YR, value 4 or 5, and chroma of 3, 4 or 6.  Iron accumulations and depletions are in shades of gray or brown.  The Bw2, Bw3 and Bw4 horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3, 4 or 6, and iron accumulations and depletions in shades of brown or gray.  Some pedons have no dominant hue in the lower Bw horizons, and have iron accumulations and depletions in shades of gray and brown in about equal amounts.  In some pedons, at depths greater than 30 inches, the lower Bw horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2 and iron accumulations in shades of brown.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  The Oaklimeter series is the only other series in this family.  Oaklimeter soils occur on flood plains and formed in silty alluvium from loess.  Oaklimeter soils have buried horizons at depths of 20 to 50 inches.


GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Barling soils occur on level to nearly level flood plains in the Boston Mountains (117) and the Arkansas Valley and Ridges (118) Major Land Resource Areas in Arkansas and Oklahoma.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Barling soils formed in silty alluvium derived from siltstone, shale, and sandstone.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 60 to 62 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 52 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Guthrie, Leadvale, Spadra and Taft series.  The poorly drained, Guthrie soils occur in adjacent valleys.  These soils have aquic moisture regimes and contain a fragipan.  Leadvale soils occur in adjacent valleys.  These soils contain an argillic horizon and a fragipan.  The well drained, Spadra soils occur adjacent low terraces and fans.  These soils have 40 to 60 inch sola and contain argillic horizons.  The somewhat poorly drained, Taft soils occur in adjacent valleys.  These soils contain glossic and argillic horizons and a fragipan.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; slow runoff; moderate permeability.  Most areas are subject to occasional flooding during the winter and spring.  A seasonally high water table is within about two feet of the soil surface during the winter and early spring.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for pasture or hay, and some areas are cultivated for production of soybeans, corn, and small grain.  Native vegetation is bottomland hardwoods such as wateroaks, red oaks, cottonwood, sweetgum, sycamore, and ash.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Arkansas, Oklahoma, and possibly Tennessee.  The series is moderately extensive.
