BERNING SERIES

The Berning series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Berning soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, mesic Xeric Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Berning gravelly loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 8 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 25 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 23 cm thick)

    Bt1--8 to 20 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak very fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine interstitial, and few fine and very fine tubular pores; many faint clay films coating sand grains; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 18 cm thick)

    Bt2--20 to 36 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely gravelly clay, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; few fine and many very fine interstitial pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 50 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual smooth boundary.

    Bt3--36 to 61 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely gravelly clay, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; common distinct clay films coating sand grains and lining pores; 50 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual smooth boundary.

    Bt4--61 to 152 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely gravelly sandy clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; few faint clay films coating sand grains and lining pores; 50 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.7).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bilbo, Clenage, Havingdon, Lambranch, Maderbak, Pula, Surgem, Tanawit, Tenmile, Vanwyper, and Zephan series.

Bilbo and Pula soils have depth to base of the argillic horizon of less than 100 cm.  Clenage, Havingdon, Maderbak, Surgem, and Vanwyper soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Lambranch soils are slightly alkaline and have depth to base of the argillic horizon of 50 to 100 cm. Tanawit soils have an argillic horizon 25 to 50 cm thick. Tenmile soils have soil temperatures of 11 to 13 degrees C. and have depth to the base of the argillic horizon of 69 to 100 cm.  Zephan soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Berning soils are on fan remnants.  They typically occur on footslope or backslope positions.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,520 to 1680 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cherry Spring, Gance, Short Creek, and Toeja soils.  Cherry Creek soils are moderately deep to a strongly cemented duripan and are fine-loamy.  Gance soils have a Bqk horizon between depths of 64 to 86 cm.  Short Creek soils have frigid soil temperature regime.  Toeja soils are fine-loamy and have mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Berning soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, basin wildrye, bottlebrush squirreltail, and little rabbitbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Nevada.  These soils are not extensive with about 8,400 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 25.
