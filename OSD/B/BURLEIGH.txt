BURLEIGH SERIES

The Burleigh series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils formed in sandy deposits over loamy and sandy stratified lacustrine deposits on lake plains, outwash plains, and deltas. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.6 degrees C (44 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy over loamy, mixed, active, nonacid, frigid Mollic Endoaquents

TYPICAL PEDON: Burleigh loamy sand, on a 1 percent slope in a cultivated area at an elevation of about 222 meters (730 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

 Ap--0 to 23 cm (9 inches); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) loamy sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many fine roots; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. [18 to 25 cm (7 to 10 inches) thick] 

 Cg1--23 to 81 cm (9 to 32 inches); gray (10YR 6/1) sand; single grain; loose; many fine roots; common fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; slightly alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary. [30 to 76 cm (12 to 30 inches) thick]

 2Cg2--81 to 152 cm (32 to 60 inches); gray (10YR 5/1) stratified silt loam and very fine sand; silt loam is massive; friable; very fine sand is single grain; loose; few fine roots; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline. 

TYPE LOCATION: Gladwin County, Michigan; about 2 miles northwest of Beaverton; 495 feet south and 100 feet east of the northwest corner of sec. 2, T. 17 N., R. 2 W. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Depth to a lithologic discontinuity (lacustrine deposits): 51 to 127 cm (20 to 50 inches)
Depth to carbonates: 51 to 127 cm (20 to 50 inches)

Some undisturbed areas have thin organic layers on the surface. 

A horizon, where present:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 2 or 2.5
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand, or the mucky analogues of these textures
Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline

Ap horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 2, 2.5, or 3
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand, or the mucky analogues of these textures
Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline

Cg horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: sand, fine sand, coarse sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand
Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline

2Cg horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR to 5Y
Value: 5 or 6
Chroma: 1 to 4
Texture: stratified silt, silt loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, very fine sand, loamy very fine sand, or loamy fine sand with occasional strata of fine sand, sand, silty clay loam, clay, or silty clay; the strata varies widely in the thickness and sequence of layers
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Brevort series. Brevort soils compete closely but do not have strata of sandy textures in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Burleigh series are on broad, slightly depressed areas on lake plains, outwash plains, and deltas. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in sandy deposits over loamy and sandy stratified lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 660 to 813 mm (26 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 5.5 to 7.8 degrees C (42 to 46 degrees F). Mean summer temperature ranges from 14.4 to 20 degrees C (58 to 68 degrees F). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bruce, Ingalls, Ocqueoc, and Roscommon soils. The somewhat poorly drained Ingalls and moderately well drained and well drained Ocqueoc soils are closely associated in a drainage sequence with the Burleigh soils. Bruce and Roscommon soils are associated on some lake plains. Bruce soils do not have the sandy A and Cg1 horizons. Roscommon soils do not have loamy 2Cg2 horizons. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained and very poorly drained. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the sandy deposits and moderately high in the lacustrine deposits. Permeability is rapid or moderately rapid in the A and Cg horizons and moderately slow in the 2Cg horizon. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Cleared areas are used for small grain and legume- grass hay. Most of these soils are in forest, permanent pasture or remain idle. Native vegetation and present vegetation includes quaking aspen, bigtooth aspen, black ash, red maple, and swamp white oak. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 94A, 94B, 94C, 95A, and 96 in northern part of the Lower Peninsula and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This series is of moderate extent.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon (mollic intergrade): from the surface to a depth of 23 cm (9 inches) (Ap horizon).
Contrasting particle-size (sandy over loamy) contact: at 81 cm (32 inches).
Aquic conditions: reduced matrix and masses of oxidized iron in all horizons below the ochric epipedon.
