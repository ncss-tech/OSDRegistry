SERIES ESTABLISHED: Worcester County, Maryland, 1995

REMARKS: Boxiron soils were formerly mapped as Tidal Marsh miscellaneous areas. They are flooded twice daily by saline or brackish tidal waters. Oxidized pH analysis indicates these soils have hypersulfidic materials (pH of 4.0 or less after 16 weeks of moist incubation), causing them to become extremely acid to ultra acid when drained. Historically, large areas of these soils were ditched for mosquito control, which has led to marsh degradation in some areas.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon (Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Thirteenth Edition):
Aquic conditions--the zone from 0 to 203 centimeters is continuously saturated (endosaturation)
Histic epipedon--the zone between 0 and 36 centimeters
Fibric soil materials--the zone between 0 and 18 centimeters has a fiber content after rubbing that is three-fourths, by volume
Hemic soil materials--the zone between 18 and 36 centimeters has a fiber content after rubbing of one-thrid, by volume
Hypersulfidic materials--the zone from 36 to 203 centimeters (oxidized pH of 4.0 or less after 16 weeks of moist incubation)
Lithologic discontinuity--the zone from 188 to 203 centimeters
Particle size control section--the zone from 25 to 100 centimeters

Database information:
NASIS site and pedon ID for typical pedon--2008MD047001

Incubated pH values were obtained from S2020NJ029020, which has similar morphology as the typical pedon.
