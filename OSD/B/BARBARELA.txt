BARBARELA SERIES

The Barbarela series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from gneiss, schist, or granite.  These soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 36 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Ustic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Barbarela coarse sandy loam, in rangeland (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 11 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) coarse sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, common fine and few medium roots; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 12 inches thick)

    AB--11 to 15 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) coarse sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist, moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine and few medium roots; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 8 inches thick)

    Bt--15 to 37 inches;  yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 10 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (12 to 30 inches thick)

    Cr--37 to 52 inches; highly weathered, decomposed gneiss bedrock that crushes to a very gravelly coarse sand.

    R--52 to 60 inches; gneiss bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - hills and mountains
Elevation - 5,900 to 8,400 feet
Slope - 2 to 45 percent
Parent material - colluvium and residuum derived from gneiss, schist or granite
Climate - long, cold winters; cool, moist springs; short summers
Mean annual precipitation - 14 to 24 inches
Mean annual air temperature - 34 to 39 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 30 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bavdark and Poin series. Bavdark soils are very deep and are pachic. They are on more concave positions. The Poin soils are shallow to a lithic contact and are loamy-skeletal. They are on more convex positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Barbarela soils are used mainly for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Potential native vegetation includes Idaho fescue, Richardson needlegrass, Columbia needlegrass, mountain brome, lupine, and sticky geranium as well as other forbs, grasses and woody shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Barbarela soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana. MLRA 43B.
