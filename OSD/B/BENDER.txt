BENDER SERIES

The Bender series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from sandstone. These soils are on gently sloping to very steep uplands. Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, siliceous, active, mesic Typic Hapludults

TYPICAL PEDON: Bender very cobbly fine sandy loam - on a convex sideslope of 8 percent in a hardwood forest at an elevation of 1,150 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Oi--0 to 1 inch; slightly decomposed oak leaf litter.

   A--1 to 5 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) very cobbly fine sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many fine and few medium roots; many very fine irregular pores; 20 percent cobbles and 20 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick)

   Bt1--5 to 13 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly fine sandy loam, weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine and few medium roots; common fine tubular pores; few distinct clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent cobbles and 30 percent gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.4); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 9 inches thick)

   Bt2--13 to 16 inches; mixed, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) and dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) extremely cobbly loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine and few medium roots; common fine tubular pores; few prominent clay films on faces of peds; 40 percent cobbles and 20 percent gravel; very strongly acid (pH 4.8); clear smooth boundary.

   Bt3--16 to 24 inches; mixed, brown (7.5YR 4/4) and yellowish red (5YR 4/6) extremely gravelly sandy loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine and medium roots; common fine tubular pores; common prominent clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 70 percent gravel; very strongly acid (pH 4.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 10 to 35 inches)

   2R--24 inches; Sandstone bedrock from the Roubidoux formation.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bendavis, Grimsley, Joppa, Lostcove, Oriskany, and Pocono series. Bendavis soils have less sand throughout the profile. Grimsley, Joppa, Lostcove, Oriskany, and Pocono soils have bedrock at a depth greater than 40 inches. In addition, Grimsley soils formed in alluvium and are semiactive.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bender soils are on moderately sloping to moderately sloping narrow ridgetops and strongly sloping to very steep sideslopes. They formed in residuum from sandstone. Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 55 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the similar Bendavis soils, and the Hogcreek, Lecoma and Poynor soils. Bendavis soils have less sand throughout the profile and are on similar positions. Hogcreek soils are on ridgetops, have less sand and fewer coarse fragments throughout the profile. Lecoma soils are very deep and occur on foot slopes. Poynor soils are very deep and are on shoulder slopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained. Runoff is medium to very high. Permeability is moderately rapid.  The saturated hydraulic conductivity is high.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used mainly for woodland. Lesser sloping areas may be cleared and used for pasture. Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods and shortleaf pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Ozarks Highlands region of south-central Missouri (MLRAs 116A).  This series is of large extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Texas County, Missouri, 1999.

REMARKS: In Missouri, these soils are mapped primarly in parent material from the Roubidoux formation.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 5 inches (Oi and A horizons)
Argillic horizon - the zone from 5 to 24 inches  (Bt horizons)
Lithic contact - at 24 inches.
