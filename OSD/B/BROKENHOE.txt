BROKENHOE SERIES

The Brokenhoe series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from volcanic rocks with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  Brokenhoe soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Brokenhoe soils are on fan remnants.  They typically occur on summit and shoulder positions.  They formed in alluvium derived mainly from volcanic rocks such as andesite with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 2,015 to 2,260 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Fisherdig, Hardnut, and Ocashe soils.  Fisherdig soils are clayey-skeletal and are shallow to a duripan.  Hardnut and Ocashe soils are shallow to lithic contacts.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; very high surface runoff; slow permeability (moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity) in the upper part and very slow permeability (low saturated hydraulic conductivity) in the duripan.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Brokenhoe soils are used for rangeland, recreation, watershed, and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, and Thurber's needlegrass with scattered singleleaf pinyon.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern California, in the western part of the Great Basin.  These soils are not extensive with about 2,200 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 26.
