BASTSIL SERIES

The Bastsil series consist of very deep, well drained moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvial sediments.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on stream terraces on river valleys. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 828 mm (33 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C (66 degrees F).

Native vegetation is mainly little bluestem with other perennial grasses and grape, greenbriar, low shrubs, with post oak and blackjack oak trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Texas, mainly along terraces of the Brazos and Trinity Rivers or other rivers that have watersheds primarily with soils of Cretaceous age.  The series is of moderate extent.
