BURNSWICK SERIES

The Burnswick series consists of very deep, well drained sodic soils formed in alluvium.  Burnswick soils are on fan terraces.  Slopes are l to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Sodic Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON: Burnswick sandy clay loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) sandy clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine vesicular pores; 5 percent gravel; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 6 inches thick)

    Bwl--3 to 11 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) sandy clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 12 inches thick)

    Bw2--11 to 16 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) sandy clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine roots; many fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 12 inches thick)

    Bknl--16 to 29 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) sandy clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine roots; common fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; secondary calcium carbonate filling pores and coating faces of peds; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 20 inches thick)

    Bkn2--29 to 41 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) sandy clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; secondary calcium carbonate filling pores and coating faces of peds; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 20 inches thick)

    BCn--41 to 53 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular and irregular pores; strongly effervescent; disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 15 inches thick)

    2Bknb--53 to 60 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) sandy clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; l0 percent fine gravel; violently effervescent; common fine and medium calcium carbonate nodules and common thin coatings on gravel; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8).

TYPE LOCATION: Navajo County, Arizona; about 7 miles northwest of Holbrook; about 2,550 feet east of the southwest corner of section 33, T. l9 N., R. 20 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July - September and December - February.  Driest during May and June.  Moist in the soil moisture control section more than 20 days cumulative in the summer.  Typic aridic soil moisture regime.

Soil Temperature - 53 to 58 degrees F.

Rock Fragments - ranges to 25 percent in any one horizon, averages less than 15 percent

Depth to base of cambic horizon - 10 to 30 inches

Salinity - nonsaline to slightly saline

Sodicity - nonsodic to strongly sodic

Organic matter - less than l percent

Reaction - moderately or strongly alkaline

Calcium carbonate: 1 to 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; as secondary fillings in pores, small masses, and as coatings on faces of peds or sand grains.

Value:  5, 6, or 7 dry, 4, 5, or 6 moist
Chroma:  2, 3, or 4, dry or moist

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Raph (NV) series. Raph soils are moist for less than 20 days cumulative in the summer months.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Burnswick soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of l to 5 percent.  They formed in fan alluvium.  Elevations are 4,800 to 6,200 feet.  The climate is cool arid continental with a mean annual precipitation of 6 to 10 inches that occurs as summer thunderstorms and winter rain and snow.  The mean annual air temperature is 5l to 56 degrees F.  The frost-free period is l30 to l90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Claysprings, Jocity, Marcou, Tours, and Sheppard soils.  Claysprings soils are fine textured and are shallow to a paralithic contact.  Jocity, Tours and Sheppard soils do not have cambic horizons.  In addition, the Sheppard soils are in a sandy family.  Marcou soils are adjacent and coarse-loamy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, recreation, and to a very limited extent for irrigated cropland.  Vegetation consists of alkali sacaton, galleta, black grama, mound saltbush, fourwing saltbush, shadscale, and Mormon-tea.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Arizona.  The series is of moderate extent. MLRA 35.
