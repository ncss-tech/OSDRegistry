BURNSWICK SERIES

The Burnswick series consists of very deep, well drained sodic soils formed in alluvium.  Burnswick soils are on fan terraces.  Slopes are 1 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches (200 mm) and the mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F (12 degrees C).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Sodic Haplocambids

Salinity - nonsaline to slightly saline

Sodicity - nonsodic to strongly sodic

Organic matter - less than 1 percent

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Raph series. Raph soils (MLRA 28B) are moist for less than 20 days cumulative in the summer months.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Burnswick soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 1 to 5 percent.  They formed in fan alluvium.  Elevations are 4,800 to 6,200 feet (1455 to 1880 m).  The climate is cool arid continental with a mean annual precipitation of 6 to 10 inches (150 to 250 mm) that occurs as summer thunderstorms and winter rain and snow.  The mean annual air temperature is 51 to 56 degrees F (11 to 13 degrees C).  The frost-free period is 130 to 190 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Claysprings, Jocity, Marcou, Tours, and Sheppard soils.  Claysprings soils are fine textured and are shallow to a paralithic contact.  Jocity, Tours and Sheppard soils do not have cambic horizons.  In addition, the Sheppard soils are in a sandy family.  Marcou soils are adjacent and coarse-loamy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, recreation, and to a very limited extent for irrigated cropland.  Vegetation consists of alkali sacaton, galleta, black grama, mound saltbush, fourwing saltbush, shadscale, and Mormon-tea.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Arizona.  The series is of moderate extent. MLRA 35.
