BOARDCAMP SERIES

The Boardcamp series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from sandstone and mudstone. These soils are on mountains and have slopes of 30 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 2540 millimeters (100 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 7 degrees C (44 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, frigid Typic Humixerepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Boardcamp very gravelly loam - under a stand of white fir, grand fir, Douglas-fir, and snowberry.  When described on September 1, 2004, the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated).

TYPE LOCATION: Humboldt County, California, Boardcamp Mountain near Dinsmore; U.S.G.S Quad: Boardcamp Mountain Quadrangle; WGS84 Decimal degrees 40.7047222 latitude and -123.7221111 longitude, UTM zone 10, 438994mE, 4506245mN, NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section is dry from July 1st to October 15th and moist in all parts from November 15 to June 1st. This soil has a xeric soil moisture regime. 

Soil temperature: The mean annual soil temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C (41 to 45 degrees F). The difference between the mean summer and mean winter temperature is greater than 6 degrees C. This soil has a frigid soil temperature regime.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils occur on mountain slopes.  They have slopes of 30 to 50 percent. Elevations are 1090 to 1486 meters (3576 to 4875 feet). These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and mudstone. The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 2032 to 2794 millimeters (80 to 110 inches). Mean January temperature is about 3 degrees C (37 degrees F); mean July temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F); and the mean annual temperature is 5 to 8 degrees C (41 to 47 degrees F).The frost free period is about 75 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Smokehouse and Triboard soils. The Smokehouse soils have greater than 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle size control section and are on convex positions. Triboard soils are moderately well drained and are in concave positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well-drained; high runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for timber production, wildlife habitat and watershed. Native vegetation is white fir, grand fir, incense cedar and Douglas-fir with an understory of snowberry, whitethorn ceanothus and bracken fern.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Siskiyou-Trinity Area, MLRA 5. These soils are of small extent.
