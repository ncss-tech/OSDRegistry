BROOKLINE SERIES

The series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in mixed stream alluvium.  Brookline soils are on flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, thermic Aquic Torrifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Brookline fine sandy loam - forestland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    C1--0 to 3 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; weak thin platy; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 5 inches thick)

    C2--3 to 18 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots, few medium roots, common coarse roots; many fine and medium irregular and tubular pores; common distinct organic coatings on ped faces; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 20 inches thick)

    C3--18 to 29 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; coarse sand; massive; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; common fine irregular pores; 10 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (6 to 15 inches thick)

    Cg--29 to 60 inches; dark bluish gray (5B 4/1) and dark gray (N 4/0) moist; very gravelly coarse sand; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 10 to 20 percent cobble and 35 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).

TYPE LOCATION: Cochise County, Arizona; located at a latitude of 31 degrees, 45 minutes, 45 seconds North and longitude of 110 degrees, 14 minutes, 45 seconds West; on the Hayhurst Ranch next to the Babocomari River in section 18, T. 20 S., R. 21 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Intermittently moist above the water table during July - September and December - February.  Driest during May and June.  Ustic aridic moisture regime based on precipitation. This soil has a fluctuating water table and is reduced.

Soil temperature: 62 to 69 degrees F.

Type of water saturation: Endosaturation

Depth to water table: 2 to 5 feet

Rock fragments: less than 35 percent, but can range to 60 to 70 percent in any one horizon

Reaction:  slightly or moderately alkaline

Calcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 5 percent

C horizon
Hue:  7.5YR, 10YR
Value:   4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma:  2 through 4, dry or moist
Texture:  fine sandy loam, fine sand, coarse sand (less than 10 percent clay)

Cg horizon
Hue:  5B, 5BG, N
Value:  3 through 5 moist
Chroma:  0 or 1 moist
Texture:  Loamy sand, coarse sand, sand (less than 10 percent clay)

Some pedons contain 2 to 3 inch gravel lenses.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Brookline soils are on floodplains at elevations of 3,700 to 4,700 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  These soils formed in mixed stream alluvium.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December to February.  The mean annual air temperature is 60 to 67 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 230 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ubik, Riveroad, Major, and Guest soils.  These soils do not have aquic conditions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; slow runoff; moderately rapid permeability.  High water table at 2 to 5 feet in addition to common flooding.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation includes black willow, mesquite, wolfberry, greythorn, cottonwood, seep willow, Arizona ash, Bermuda grass and giant sacaton.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Arizona.  Brookline soils are of small extent.  Brookline is the name of a local ranch. This soil occurs in LRR-D, MLRA 41.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Cochise County, Arizona.  Soil survey of Cochise County, Arizona, Douglas - Tombstone Part; 1996.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Redoximorphic features - The zone from 29 to 60 inches (Cg horizon)

Entisol feature - The absence of diagnostic subsurface horizons

Fluvial feature - Irregular decrease in organic carbon in the zone from 3 to 60 inches (C2, C3, Cg horizons)

Aquic subgroup: has redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less and aquic conditions within 40 inches for some time in normal years

Classified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999.
