BUNYARD SERIES

The Bunyard series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic ash. Bunyard soils are on lake terraces. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy, glassy, frigid Durinodic Natrargids 

TYPICAL PEDON: Bunyard ashy silt loam--on a one percent slope at an elevation of 1,515 meters--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. When described on October 21, 1998, the soil was dry on the surface and slightly moist in the subsoil.)

COMPETING SERIES: There are currently no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bunyard soils are on lake terraces. These soils formed in lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic ash. The ash is Holocene age and of dacite (acidic) composition. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. Elevations range from 1,310 to 1,345 meters. The climate is semiarid and is characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Picturerock and Thornlake soils. Picturerock and Thornlake soils do not have horizons with firm, brittle matrix. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low surface runoff; slow permeability: moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Bunyard soils are used for livestock grazing. The present vegetation is mainly black greasewood and inland saltgrass with scattered shadscale. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Oregon. These soils are not extensive with about 620 acres of the series mapped to date. MLRA 23.
