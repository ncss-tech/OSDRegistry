BULL SERIES

The Bull series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in loess over residuum weathered from rhyolite.  Bull soils are in swales on hills and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3.9 degrees C.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bull silt loam in a swale on a hill with 7 percent slope at an elevation of 1,888 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 A1--0 to 15 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; strong fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and common fine and medium roots; many very fine irregular pores; 2 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear wavy boundary.

 Bt2--69 to 85 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine,  fine, and medium tubular pores; few (10 percent) distinct clay films; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of Bt horizons is 40 to 69 cm)

 2Bt3--85 to 96 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely channery sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; moderately hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; many (70 percent) distinct clay films; 40 percent channers and 40 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt wavy boundary.

 2Bt4--96 to 133 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely flaggy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many (70 percent) distinct clay films; 30 percent flagstones, 40 percent channers, and 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of 2Bt horizons is 40 to 50 cm)
