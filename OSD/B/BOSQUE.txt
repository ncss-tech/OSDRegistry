BOSQUE SERIES

The Bosque series consists of very deep to loamy alluvium, well drained soils that formed in loamy, calcareous alluvium of Pleistocene age derived from limestone and shale.  These nearly level soils are on treads of flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 786 mm (30.95 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 17.7 degrees C (63.8 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Cumulic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bosque loam--in a cultivated field.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

Soil Temperature: 18.9 to 22.2 degrees C (66 to 72 degrees F)
Thickness of the mollic epipedon: 51 to 152 cm (20 to 60 in)

Other features: Some pedons have brownish Bw or C horizons that range from fine sandy loam to clay.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are Baileyboro (TX), Bippus (TX), Gageby (TX), Gowen (TX), Stanford (AZ), and Whitesboro (TX) series.  Similar soils are the Bergstrom, Frio, Oakalla, and Venus series.
Baileyboro, Bippus, and Gageby soils: are drier for longer periods of time and receive less than 711 mm (28 in) of annual rainfall.  
Gowen, Stanford, and Whitesboro soils are noncalcareous.    
Bergstrom soils: have fine-silty control sections.  
Frio soils: have fine textured control sections.  
Oakalla soils: have carbonatic mineralogy.  
Venus soils: have mollic epipedons less than 51 cm (20 in) thick and are on uplands.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the competing Frio, Deleon, and Venus series.  Also associated are Bunyan and Lewisville series.  
Bunyan soils: lack mollic epipedons.
Frio soils: have a fine textured particle size control section
Deleon sois:  have a fine textured particle size control section and have vertic properties

Venus soils: have molllic epipedons less than 51 cm (20 in) thick and have a calcic horizon within 100 cm (40 in)

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  
Drainage class: Well.  
Permeability class: Moderate.  
Runoff: negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes. 
Wetness: the soil floods at 1 to 10 year intervals, except where protected by dikes or dams.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are being farmed to sorghums, small grains, and pecan orchards.  Some areas are used for bermudagrass pastures.  Native trees are elm, hackberry, pecan, live oak, and cottonwood.  Grasses include big and little bluestem, indiangrass, switchgrass, and sideoats grama.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  This soil occurs mainly in the Grand Prairies (MLRA 85), West Cross Timbers (MLRA 84B), and Blackland Prairies (MLRA 86A) of north-central Texas.  It is of large extent.
