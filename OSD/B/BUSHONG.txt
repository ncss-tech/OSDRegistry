BUSHONG SERIES

The Bushong series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on stream terraces, outwash plains and floodplains. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid Aeric Endoaquents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bushong loam, in pasture (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 3 cm; partially decomposed organic matter. (3 to 5 cm thick)

    A--3 to 8 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine and common medium roots; common fine and very fine discontinuous irregular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 10 cm thick)

    Bw--8 to 13 cm; dark brown (10YR 3/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine and common medium roots; common fine and very fine discontinuous irregular pores; few fine faint dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) redox concentrations; 5 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 10 cm thick)

    Bk--13 to 41 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine and common medium roots; common fine and very fine discontinuous irregular pores; many fine distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4) redox concentrations; 10 percent cobbles and 20 percent gravel; disseminated calcium carbonate; few fine masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 30 cm thick)

    2C--41 to 155 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few medium and common fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine discontinuous irregular pores; many medium distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) redox concentrations; 30 percent cobbles and 25 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary.
