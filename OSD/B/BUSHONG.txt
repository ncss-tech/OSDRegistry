BUSHONG SERIES

The Bushong series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on stream terraces, outwash plains and floodplains. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid Aeric Endoaquents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bushong loam, in pasture (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--1 inch to 0; partially decomposed organic matter. (1 to 2 inches thick)

    A--0 to 2 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine and common medium roots; common fine and very fine discontinuous irregular pores; 5 percent pebbles; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick)

    Bw--2 to 4 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine and common medium roots; common fine and very fine discontinuous irregular pores; few fine faint dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) redox concentrations; 5 percent pebbles; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 4 inches thick)

    Bk--4 to 15 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine and common medium roots; common fine and very fine discontinuous irregular pores; many fine distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4) redox concentrations; 10 percent cobbles and 20 percent pebbles; disseminated lime; few fine masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary. (4 to 12 inches thick)

    2C--15 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few medium and common fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine discontinuous irregular pores; many medium distinct brown (10YR 4/4) redox concentrations; 30 percent cobbles and 25 percent pebbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Powell County, Montana, 1995.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1392.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a thin dark surface 4 inches thick (A, Bw horizons); a horizon of lime accumulation from 4 to 15 inches (Bk horizon); a lithologic discontinuity at 15 inches (2C horizon); a particle-size control from 10 to 40 inches.  Bushong soils have a frigid temperature regime and an aquic moisture regime.
