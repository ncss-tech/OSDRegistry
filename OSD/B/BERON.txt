BERON SERIES

The Beron series consists of shallow over duripan, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on dissected relict stream terraces and fan terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium over lacustrine sediments derived dominantly from igneous rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Elevation is 5,700 to 6,700 feet.  Average annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F., and the average freeze free season is 100 to 120 days.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Xeric Argidurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Beron gravelly sandy loam, 2 to 8 percent slopes, rangeland (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). The soil surface is covered with 30 percent gravel.

    2C1--24 to 40 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very gravelly loamy coarse sand, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; single grain; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common medium and fine pores; 50 percent gravel; strongly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); gradual wavy boundary. (12 to 24 inches thick)

    2C2--40 to 60 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly loamy coarse sand, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common medium and fine pores; 40 percent gravel; strongly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Beron soils are on dissected relict stream terraces and fan terraces. These soils formed in alluvium over lacustrine sediments derived dominantly from igneous rocks. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. Elevations are 5,700 to 6,700 feet. Average annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F., and the average freeze free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Deerlodge and Plegomir soils.  Deerlodge soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a duripan.  Plegomir soils lack an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow or medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  This soil is used for rangeland. Important plants are Indian ricegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass and black sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Iron County, Utah; MLRA 28A. This soil is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Iron County, Utah; Iron-Washington Soil Survey Area; 1997; The named is coined with a combination of the Beaver and Iron County names.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to 3 inches. (A horizon)

Argillic horizon - the zone of clay accumulation from 3 to 10 inches.  (Bt horizon)

Duripan - the indurated silica horizon from 18 to 24 inches. (2Bkqm horizon)

Particle-size control section - the zone from 3 to 18 inches

The classification is based on the "Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eighth Edition, 1998".  The cation exchange activity class is an estimate based on NASIS data.
