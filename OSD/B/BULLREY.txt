BULLREY SERIES

The Bullrey series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium or colluvium from rhyolitic or similar rock sources. Bullrey soils are on alluvial fans and colluvial slopes.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. The annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Pachic Haplocryolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Bullrey very gravelly loam, rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(2 to 6 inches thick)

    A2--4 to 9 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) angular very gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure that parts to moderate very fine and fine granules; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine and few medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; 45 percent coarse gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.7); clear wavy boundary.

(4 to 10 inches thick)

    C2--26 to 48 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; common fine distinct light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) streaks and mottles, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak thick platy structure; hard, firm, (brittle); few fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine tubular pores; 3 percent flagstones, 20 percent gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.5); clear irregular boundary. (0 to 26 inches thick)

    C3--48 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) extremely gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; hard, firm; few fine roots; few very fine pores; about 10 percent flagstones, about 60 to 70 percent gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.5).
