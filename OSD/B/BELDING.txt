BELDING SERIES

The Belding series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy glacial till on till plains and end moraines.  Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the upper part of the solum,moderately slow in the lower part and slow to very slow in the substratum.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Alfic Epiaquods

TYPE LOCATION:  Ontonagon County, Michigan; about 3 miles east of the town of Greenland; 2400 feet south and 1885 feet east of the northwest corner of section 29, T. 51 N., R. 37 W.  NAD83, UTM Zone 16N, 5183527 northing and 345053 easting.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Reaction in the upper part of the solum ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid. Depth to the 2B horizons ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Reaction in the lower part of the solum and substratum ranges from slightly acid to strongly alkaline. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent and cobble content from 0 to 5 percent throughout the profile. The depth to densic contact is 30 to 60 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Moodig, Mudlake, Parkfalls, Pesabic and Worwood series. 
Moodig soils are coarser textured and acidic throughout. 
Mudlake soils have a loess or silty alluvium cap and are acidic throughout. 
Pesabic soils are underlain by dense till and are acidic throughout. 
Worwood soils are loamy alluvium underlain by sandy outwash that is underlain by stratified lacustrine deposits.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Belding soils are on till plains and end moraines.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. 
Mean annual precipitation ranges from 31 to 34 inches.  
The mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 44 degrees F. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ubly, Loggerhead, Menominee, Iosco and Breckenridge soils. 
The well drained Ubly, moderately well drained Loggerhead, and poorly drained Breckenridge soils are in a drainage sequence with Belding soils. 
The moderately well drained Menominee and somewhat poorly drained Iosco soils have more sand in the solum.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  
Surface runoff is low.  
Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid above the 2B horizons and moderately slow in the 2Bt and 2BC horizons.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are forested.  The major species are sugar maple, red maple, green ash, quaking aspen, eastern hemlock, basswood, yellow birch, white spruce and balsam fir.  Some areas are used for pasture, small grains, mixed hay or are idle.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Upper Peninsula of Michigan.  The series is of moderate extent.
