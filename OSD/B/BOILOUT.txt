BOILOUT SERIES

The Boilout series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in eolian volcanic ash over residuum derived from basalt and tuff.  Boilout soils are on lava plateaus and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Boilout soils are on lava plateaus and hills.  These soils formed in eolian material with a high content of volcanic ash over residuum derived from basalt or tuff.  Slopes are 2 to 10 percent.  Elevations range from 1,310 to 1,505 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brace, Rabbithills, and Raz soils.  Brace soils are fine-loamy and are moderately deep to thin duripans overlying lithic contacts.  Rabbithills soils are loamy, have cambic horizons, and have thin, strongly cemented duripans.  Raz soils are loamy and are shallow to thin duripans overlying lithic contacts.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; low surface runoff; moderately slow permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Boilout soils are used for livestock grazing.  The vegetation is basin big sagebrush, Thurber's needlegrass, Indian ricegrass, and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Oregon.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 23.
