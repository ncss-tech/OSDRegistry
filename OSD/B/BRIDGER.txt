BRIDGER SERIES

The Bridger series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, outwash, colluvium, till or slide deposits derived from mixed rock sources.  These soils are on alluvial fans, outwash fans, fan remnants, stream terraces, drainageways, moraines, hills, mountain slopes, ridges and landslides.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive Ustic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Bridger loam, cultivated (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 9 inches, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many very fine and fine pores; 5 percent gravel, 1 percent stones below surface; neutral (pH 7.0); clear boundary. (7 to 16 inches thick)

    Bt--9 to 24 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to strong coarse medium and fine blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine pores; distinct continuous very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent gravel, 1 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 30 inches thick)

    Bk1--24 to 36 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; 15 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; few large masses of lime; continuous distinct lime casts on underside of rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual boundary. (4 to 15 inches thick)

    Bk2--36 to 60 inches, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) gravelly loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; 20 percent gravel; 5 percent cobbles; common distinct lime casts on undersides of rock fragments mainly in the upper part of the horizon; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).
