BAYARD SERIES

The Bayard series consists of very deep well drained soils on foot slopes, and stream terraces. They formed in colluvial-alluvial sediments weathered mostly from sandstone. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 41 centimeters (16 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C. (53 degrees F.) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Torriorthentic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Bayard fine sandy loam - cultivated field. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  Ap--0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak, fine granular structure; soft, very friable; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. (15 to 25 centimeters (6 to 10 inches) thick)

  A--18 to 33 centimeters (7 to 13 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak, coarse, subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable; slight effervescence; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (5 to 25 centimeters (2 to 10 inches) thick)

  AC--33 to 56 centimeters (13 to 22 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak, coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (10 to 30 centimeters (4 to 12 inches) thick)

  C1--56 to 107 centimeters (22 to 42 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable; strong effervescence; slightly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.

  C2--107 to 140 centimeters (42 to 55 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam; brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline gradual wavy boundry.

  C3--140 to 203 centimeters (55 to 80 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam; brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Garden County, Nebraska: about 9 kilometers (5 1/2 miles) west of Oshkosh, Nebraska on US highway 26; 488 meters (1600 feet) north and 549 meters (1800 feet) east of the southwest corner, section 13, township 17 north, range 45 west; USGS topographic quadrangle, Coumbe Bluff, NE; 41 degrees, 26 minutes, 36 seconds north latitude, 102 degrees, 27 minutes, 28 seconds west longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Some pedons have a BK horizon instead of an AC horizon 
Depth to carbonates: 20 to 51 centimeters (8 to 20 inches) 
The thickness of the mollic epipedon: 20 to 51 centimeters (8 to 20 inches)
The mean annual precipitation: 36 to 46 centimeters (14 to 18 inches)
Annual temperature: 8 to 15 degrees C. (47 to 59 degrees F)

A horizon: 
Hue: 10YR
Value: 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Reaction: neutral or slightly alkaline
Texture: fine sandy loam and less commonly loam, sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy very fine sand 

AC horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value of 5 or 6 and 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline
Texture: fine sandy loam, sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loamy very fine sand

C horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline
Texture: fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loamy very fine sand but the lower part of the control section in some profiles is loamy fine sand
Control section: more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser but less than 30 percent medium sand and coarser and averages less than 18 percent clay
Gravel size granite and sandstone pebbles: common on the surface and throughout the solum

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bordeaux, Bushman and Ponderosa series. 
Bordeaux soils have the lower part of the control section formed in materials derived from Brule siltstone and have a finer textured substratum. 
Bushman soils are typically calcareous at the surface. 
Ponderosa soils typically have carbonates at depths below 20 inches. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landscapes: stream valleys
Landforms: foot slopes, and stream terraces
Parent material: colluvial-alluvial sediments weathered mostly from sandstone 
Slope: 0 to 6 percent

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alice, Bridget, Chappell, Oglala, otero and Vetal series. 
Alice soils have calcium carbonates deeper in the profile.
Bridget soils are coarse silty.
Chappell are underlain by sand and gravel within a depth of 102 centimeters (40 inches.
Oglala soils have bedrock between a depth of 102 and 152 centimeters (40 and 60 inches).
Otero soils have thiner light colored surface layers.
Vetal soils have mollic epipedons more than 51 centimeters (20 inches) thick.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage: well drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity:  high
Runoff: low to moderate depending upon slope 

USE AND VEGETATION: About half of the soil areas are cultivated. 
Where irrigated, corn, field beans, potatoes, alfalfa, and sugar beets are the principal crops.
Wheat is grown on dry farmed land.
The remaining areas are in native grassland.
The dominant grasses are needleandthread, prairie sandreed, blue or hairy grama, western wheatgrass, and little bluestem.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Nebraska, southwestern South Dakota, western Kansas, eastern Wyoming, and northeastern Colorado. The series is extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Texas County, Oklahoma, 1959.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons or features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 41 centimeters (0 to 16 inches) (Ap and A horizons)

Modified format by LRM in 1/2006 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.
