BROADMOOR SERIES

The Broadmoor series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in materials weathered from granite.  Broadmoor soils are on mountain slopes and ridges and have slopes of 15 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 480 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Udic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Broadmoor extremely gravelly sandy loam - forested.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 3 cm; undecomposed organic material, mostly needles, bark, and twigs.

    Oe--3 to 6 cm; partially decomposed organic material.

    E--6 to 44 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 60 percent gravel; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (25 to 50 cm thick)

    Bw--44 to 77 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely gravelly sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 60 percent gravel; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary. 

    Cr--77 cm; grus (highly weathered granite).

TYPE LOCATION:  El Paso County, Colorado; about 4 kilometers west on Old Stage Road from intersection with Penrose Boulevard, in SE 1/4 of Sec. 3, T.  15 S., R. 67 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Mean annual soil temperature--7 to 8 degrees C
Depth to paralithic contact--50 to 100 cm

Particle size control section:
Rock fragment content--35 to 80 percent by volume and are mostly 5 to 40 mm in diameter
Clay content--10 to 25 percent

The profile has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Drexel, Hagstadt, and Winkler series.  Drexel and Winkler soils have no paralithic contact within a depth of 100 cm.  Hagstadt soils have clay loam or silty clay loam B horizons and have fractured siltstone at depths of 50 to 100 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform--mountain slopes and ridges
Elevation--952 to 1775 meters
Slope--15 to 70 percent
Parent materials--materials weathered from granite
Mean annual precipitation--430 to 530 mm
Mean annual air temperature--6 to 7 degrees C
Frost-free period--85 to 95 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; rapid runoff; rapid permeability

USE AND VEGETATION:  Use is for forestry, recreation, and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation is mostly ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, and white fir, with a sparse understory of grasses and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Broadmoor soils are moderately extensive in eastcentral Colorado along foothills of the front range and the mountains of western Montana; MLRAs 43A, 43B, 48A
