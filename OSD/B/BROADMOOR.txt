BROADMOOR SERIES

The Broadmoor series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in materials weathered from granite.  Broadmoor soils are on mountain slopes and ridges and have slopes of 15 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Udic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Broadmoor extremely gravelly sandy loam - forested.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    01--2 to 1 inch; undecomposed organic material, mostly needles, bark, and twigs.

    02--1 to 0 inch; partially decomposed organic material.

    A2--0 to 15 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 60 percent gravel; medium acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (10 to 20 inches thick)

    B2--15 to 28 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely gravelly sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 60 percent gravel; medium acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (10 to 20 inches thick)

    Cr--28 inches; grus (highly weathered granite).

TYPE LOCATION:  El Paso County, Colorado; 2.7 miles west on Old Stage Road from intersection with Penrose Boulevard, in SE 1/4 of Sec. 3, T.  15 S., R. 67 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 44 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments in the control section range from 35 to 80 percent by volume and are mostly 1/4 to 1-1/2 inches in diameter.  The fine earth fraction of the control section ranges in clay from 10 to 25 percent.  The profile has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Drexel, Hagstadt, and Winkler series.  Drexel and Winkler soils have no paralithic contact within a depth of 40 inches.  Hagstadt soils have clay loam or silty clay loam B horizons and have fractured siltstone at depths of 20 to 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Broadmoor soils are on mountain slopes and ridges and have slopes of 15 to 70 percent.  These soils formed in parent materials weathered from granite.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is about 17 to 21 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 85 to 95 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Kutler, Coldcreek, and Tecolote soils.  Kutler soils have mollic epipedons.  Coldcreek and Tecolote soils have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; rapid runoff; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Use is for forestry, recreation, and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation is mostly ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, and white fir, with a sparse understory of grasses and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central Colorado along foothills of front range.  The series is inextensive.
