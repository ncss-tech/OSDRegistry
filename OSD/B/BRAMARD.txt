BRAMARD SERIES

The Bramard series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum from basalt. Bramard soils are on mountains and have slopes of 5 to 60 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active Pachic Argicryolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Bramard stony loam - forest. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oe--0 to 2 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) slightly and moderately decomposed needles, leaves, wood, and cones; abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 3 inches thick)

    A1--2 to 7 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate very fine and fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; many very fine interstitial and tubular pores; 3 percent stones and 10 percent cobblestones and angular gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.7); gradual wavy boundary. (3 to 7 inches thick)

    A2--7 to 13 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) (10YR 5/3 crushed) cobbly loam, very dark brown (7.5YR 2/2) (very dark grayish brown 10YR 3/2 crushed) moist; moderate very fine and fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, few medium, and common coarse roots; many very fine interstitial and common very fine tubular pores; 3 percent stones and 18 percent cobblestones and angular basalt gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.7); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 9 inches thick)

    A3--13 to 19 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) (10YR 5/3 crushed) cobbly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky and moderate fine, very fine, and medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine and few fine tubular pores; few faint clay films in channels; 15 percent basaltic cobblestones and 4 percent angular gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.7); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick)

    AB--19 to 27 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) (10YR 5/3 crushed) cobbly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) (10YR 3/3 crushed) moist; moderate very fine and fine subangular blocky and weak fine and medium granular structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on peds and faint patchy clay films in channels; 15 percent cobblestones and 3 percent angular gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.3); gradual wavy boundary. (4 to 12 inches thick)

    Bt1--27 to 40 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak medium and coarse prismatic structure that parts to moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine and common medium tubular pores; faint patchy clay films on peds and medium nearly continuous in some pores; 10 percent basalt cobblestones and 3 percent angular gravel; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); gradual wavy boundary. (7 to 20 inches thick)

    Bt2--40 to 46 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) and very pale brown (10YR 7/3) light clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; common fine distinct reddish brown (5YR 5/4) and yellowish red (5YR 5/6) mottles; very weak medium and coarse prismatic structure that parts to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; faint patchy clay films on peds and distinct in channels; 10 percent basalt cobblestones and 3 percent well decomposed gravel; very strongly acid (pH 4.5); gradual irregular boundary. (2 to 10 inches thick)

    C--46 to 52 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) cobbly loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; structureless, massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; discontinuous distinct clay films in pores and on gravel; 30 percent basaltic cobblestones and angular gravel that are well weathered; very strongly acid (pH 4.8).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.
 
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils occupy broad ridges (slopes of 5 to 20 percent) and side slopes (slopes of 10 to 60 percent) at elevations between 5,000 and 7,200 feet. The parent materials are colluvium or residuum from basalt. In places the soils overlie sediments. The average annual precipitation is 25 to 35 inches, including about 7 to 15 feet of snowfall. The frost-free period is from 30 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Coski and Koppes series. These soils are formed in materials weathered from granitic rocks and have coarse sandy loam and coarse loamy sand textures.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; medium or rapid runoff; and moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used principally for forestry, grazing, watershed, wildlife, and recreation. Much has been logged and is grazed by cattle. The vegetation consists of Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, ninebark, spirae, wildrose, willow, huckleberry, thimbleberry, elk sedge, and pinegrass. Subalpine fir is common at the higher elevations.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Moderately extensive in south-central Idaho.
