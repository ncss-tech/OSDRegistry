BREETON SERIES

The Breeton series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium derived from granite and other coarse grained igneous rocks.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces and hills.  Slopes are 1 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Breeton loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A1--0 to 4 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary.

    A2--4 to 12 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) gravelly loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of A1 and A2 horizons is 10 to 24 inches)

    Bw--12 to 26 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; 20 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual irregular boundary. (10 to 22 inches thick)

    BC--26 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; 25 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).

USE AND VEGETATION: Breeton soils are primarily used for rangeland.  The potential native vegetation is mainly Idaho fescue, rough fescue, Western wheatgrass, needleandthread, prairie junegrass, serviceberry, shrubby cinquefoil, big sagebrush, and Rocky Mountain juniper.  Areas in woodland have an overstory of Douglas fir or ponderosa pine and an understory of Idaho fescue, rough fescue, and big sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Breeton soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.  MLRA 43B.
