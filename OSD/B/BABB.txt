BABB SERIES

The Babb series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alpine till and colluvium derived from a mixture of argillite, quartzite, limestone, and calcareous shale. These soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, hills, moraines and mountains. Slopes are 2 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Calcic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Babb cobbly loam, grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 7 inches; black (10YR 2/1) cobbly loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 15 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear irregular boundary. (5 to 12 inches thick)

    Bw1--7 to 15 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common fine and medium interstitial pores, and few fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.

    Bw2--15 to 21 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common fine and medium interstitial pores, and few fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (combined thickness of Bw1, Bw2 - 9 to 22 inches)

    Bk--21 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) gravelly loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; weak medium platy structure becoming moderate in the lower part; very hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots with concentrations of roots in vertical cracks; 20 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; finely disseminated calcium carbonate, and calcium carbonate coats on rock fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).
