BADENAUGH SERIES

The Badenaugh series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks.  Badenaugh soils are on fan remnants and stream terraces.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

Badena, Lemm, and Oest soils have depth to base of the argillic horizons of less than 60 inches and have sandy-skeletal C horizons.  Eaglerock, Searvar, and Trid soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Gitabyte, Grinrod, Ister, Searles are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Leviathan soils are dominated by gravel and have 55 to 60 percent of the sand fraction in the particle-size control section as very coarse sand and coarse sand.  Nosrac soils are dominated by gravel and have mollic epipedons that are 14 to 20 inches thick.  Shroe soils have discontinuities of loamy lacustrine deposits within 40 inches.  Tristan soils are deep to lithic contacts.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Badenaugh soils are on fan remnants and stream terraces. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,000 to 6,000 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 16 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F., mean January temperature is about 30 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is about 69 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Calpine, Dotta, Sattley, and Trojan soils.  Calpine and Dotta soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments.  Trojan and Sattley soils have a xeric moisture regime and a base saturation of 50 to 75 percent in some or all parts of the upper 30 inches of the profile.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium or high surface runoff; moderate or moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Badenaugh soils are used for rangeland.  The vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, Indian ricegrass, Thurber's needlegrass, and scattered western juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern California.  These soils are moderately extensive.  The series concept and main acreage is in MLRA 21, while other acreage occurs in MLRA 23.
