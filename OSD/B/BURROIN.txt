BURROIN SERIES

The Burroin series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metamorphic rocks. These soils are on mountains and have slopes of 2 to 75 percent.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Horseshoe (CA) and Mieruf (CA) series.  Horseshoe soils are greater than 150 centimeters (60 inches) to lithic contact.  Mieruf soils are greater than 100 centimeters (40 inches) to a paralithic contact. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils occur on mountains with slopes of 2 to 75 percent at elevations of 33 to 1391 meters (108 to 4563 feet) on convex ridge summits and linear side slopes. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from schist. The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 1250 to 2032 millimeters (49 to 80 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F). Mean summer temperature is 20 degrees C (68 degrees F) and the mean winter temperature is 7 degrees C (44 degrees F), mean annual temperature ranges from 10 to 15 degrees C (50 to 59 degrees F). The frost free season is about 150 to 250 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bagaul(T) and Hullygully(T) soils. Bagaul soils are very deep, greater than 150 centimeters (60 inches) to a bedrock contact. Hullygully soils do not have an argillic horizon. Bagual soils are adjacent to Burroin soils on linear to concave slope positions. Hullygully soils are on toeslopes. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well-drained; medium to high runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for timber production, watershed and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is Douglas-fir, tanoak, Pacific madrone with an understory of salal, Oregon grape, poison oak, and bracken fern. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Siskyou-Trinity Area, MLRA 5. The series is not extensive.
