BERRYHILL SERIES

The Berryhill series consists of very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and slope alluvium derived from gypsiferous shale. Berryhill soils are on alluvial fans on valley sides, hills and stream terraces on valley floors. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Chromic Gypsitorrerts

TYPICAL PEDON: Berryhill silty clay--in rangeland on a convex surface of 4 percent slope at an elevation of 7,120 feet. (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.)

(The combined thickness of the Bssyz horizons are 20 to 69 inches.)

    Bssyz2--26 to 39 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine roots; few fine irregular pores; common pressure faces; few 0.5 inch slickensides; few fine gypsum and sodium sulfate crystals; carbonates are disseminated; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (The combined thickness of the Bssyz horizons are 20 to 69 inches.)

    Bssyz3--39 to 70 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; extremely hard, extremely firm; very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; few fine irregular pores; many pressure faces; common fine gypsum and sodium sulfate crystals; carbonates are disseminated; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0). (The combined thickness of the Bssyz horizons are 20 to 69 inches.)

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Rehobeth (NM) series.  The Rehobeth soils have hues 2.5YR and redder.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Berryhill soils formed in alluvium and slope alluvium derived from gypsiferous Mancos shale and are alluvial fans on valley sides and hills and stream terraces on valley floors. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 7,000 to 7,800 feet. The mean annual temperature is 49 to 54 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches. The frost free period is 120 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Casamero, Penistaja and Tintero
soils on fan terraces; and the Sparank, San Mateo, and Zia soils on floodplains, alluvial fans, and stream terraces. The Casamero soils are moderately deep to shale. The Penistaja and Tintero soils are fine-loamy. The Sparank, San Mateo, and Zia soils lack a gypsic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, medium to very high runoff, and very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: This series is used for rangeland. The present vegetation is western wheatgrass, blue grama, bottlebrush squirreltail, winterfat, fourwing saltbush, galleta, threeawns, broom snakeweed, rubber rabbitbrush, and scattered pinyon pine and oneseed juniper. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West central New Mexico. MLRA 35, LRR-D. This series is of small extent.
