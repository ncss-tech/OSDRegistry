BEESKOVE SERIES 

The Beeskove series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from argillite, quartzite and limestone.  These soils are on mountains and trough walls.  Slopes are 4 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Eutrudepts 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Beeskove gravelly loam, forested.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    0--0 to 2 inches; undecomposed and slightly decomposed forest litter.  (1 to 2 inches thick)

    E--2 to 10 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots and few coarse roots; many very fine and fine pores; 25 percent angular pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick) 

    E/Bw--10 to 22 inches; E part (75 percent) is pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; B part (25 percent) is pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; texture mixed is very gravelly loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots and few coarse roots; many very fine and fine pores; 40 percent angular pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 15 inches thick) 

    Bw--22 to 29 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots and few medium roots; common very fine and fine pores; 45 percent angular pebbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 18 inches thick) 

    Bk1--29 to 49 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) extremely gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few very fine pores; 60 percent angular pebbles and 5 percent angular cobbles; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 25 inches thick) 

    Bk2--49 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) extremely gravelly loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 65 percent angular pebbles and 5 percent angular cobbles; disseminated lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Beeskove soils are used for timber production and watersheds and as wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is Douglas- fir, western larch, ponderosa pine, and lodgepole pine with an understory of twinflower, blue huckleberry, dwarf huckleberry, myrtle pachistima, and common beargrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Beeskove soils are of small extent in western Montana.

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretation Record:  MT0811.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the mineral soil surface to 7 inches (E horizon); an albic horizon from 2 to 10 inches (E horizon); a cambic horizon from 10 to 29 inches (E/Bw, Bw horizons); accumulation of secondary carbonates from 29 to 60 inches (Bk1, Bk2 horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches below the mineral soil surface (E/Bw, Bw, Bk1 horizons).  Beeskove soils have a udic moisture regime and a frigid temperature regime.
