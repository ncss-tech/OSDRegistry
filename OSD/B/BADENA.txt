BADENA SERIES

The Badena series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from quartzite. Badena soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ashue, Badenaugh, Eaglerock, Gitabyte, Grinrod, Ister, Lemm, Leviathan, Nosrac, Oest, Searles, Searvar, Shawmount, Shree, Shroe, Tollgate, Trid, and Tristan series.

Ashue soils have argillic horizons with neutral soil reaction. Badenaugh soils have slightly acid or neutral soil reaction and do not have sandy-skeletal material within a depth of 100 cm. Eaglerock, Trid, and Searvar soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts. Gitabyte, Grinrod, Ister, and Searles soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts. Tristan soils are deep to lithic contacts. Lemm soils average 10 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Leviathan soils have depth to base of the argillic horizon of 100 to 178 cm. Leviathan, Nosrac, Oest, and Shroe soils  average less than 60  percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Nosrac soils have 36 to 50 cm thick mollic epipedons, and hue of 5Y in lower subhorizons. Ashue,Oest, Shawmount, Shree, and Shroe soils are dominated by gravel in the particle-size control section. Shawmount soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 11 degrees C. Shree soils do not contain sandy textures in the C horizon. Shroe soils have upper sub-horizons within the particle-size control section that average 35 to 45 percent clay. Tollgate soils have an argillic horizon with a base depth greater than 36 inches. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Badena soils are fan remnants. These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from quartzite. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. Elevations range from 1,616 to 2,515 meters. The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Heist and Heusser soils. Heist soils are on inset fans, have 8 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section, have an ochric epipedon and a cambic horizon. Heusser soils have 40 to 55 percent clay in the particle-size control section. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Badena soils are used primarily for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Potential native vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, western wheatgrass, and dryland sedges. This pedon is correlated to ecological site R028AY095NV, Loamy 10-12 P.Z.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Nevada. These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 28A.
