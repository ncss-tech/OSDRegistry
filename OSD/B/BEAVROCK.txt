BEAVROCK SERIES

The Beavrock series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on flood plains, flood plain steps, and sloughs. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid Typic Fluvaquents 

TYPICAL PEDON: Beavrock silt loam, in rangeland. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted) 

    Oe--0 to 3 inches; mat of roots and partially decomposed sedges and grasses; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 5 inches thick)

    A--3 to 8 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; moderate fine and medium platy structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine and few fine interstitial pores; disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 10 inches thick)

    C1--8 to 15 inches; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) clay loam consisting of thin strata of silty clay loam, loam, and sandy loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) dry; massive; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; many fine and very fine tubular and interstitial pores; disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.

    C2--15 to 20 inches; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) clay loam consisting of thin strata of silty clay loam and sandy loam, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) dry; few fine and medium distinct brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) redox concentrations; massive; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular and interstitial pores; disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (combined thickness of C1 and C2 horizons is 10 to 14 inches)

    C3--20 to 23 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) sandy loam, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) dry; common fine, medium, and coarse prominent brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) redox concentrations; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 5 inches thick)

    Cg1--23 to 28 inches; dark gray (N 4/) silty clay loam, light greenish gray (10Y 7/1) dry; many medium and coarse prominent brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) redox concentrations; massive; extremely hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick)

    2Cg2--28 to 60 inches; dark gray (N 4/) extremely gravelly sand, light greenish gray (10Y 7/1) dry; massive; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 65 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; disseminated calcium carbonate; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).
