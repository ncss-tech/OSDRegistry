USE AND VEGETATION: 
Under natural conditions Brynwood soils are used for water quality and wildlife habitat, some areas are used for rangeland, tame pasture, and urban land. 
Potential native vegetation consists of pineland threeawn, paspalum spp., bluejoint panicum, blue maidencane, bluestem, scattered cypress, saw palmettos, and slash pine.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Broward County, Florida; 1973.

REMARKS: 
Particle sized control section:  25 to 41 centimeters (10 to 16 inches)

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - 0 to 25 centimeters (0 to 10 inches) (A, E horizons)

Albic horizon - 10 to 25 centimeters (4 to 10 inches) (E horizon)

Lithic contact - 41 centimeters (16 inches) (2R horizon)

Aquic conditions - 0 to 30 centimeters (0 to 12 inches)

Endosaturation - 0 to 41 centimeters (0 to 16 inches)

This series does not contain a cambic horizon, it does not meet in taxonomy 2 a (1) which is soil structure or the absence of rock structure including fine stratification in more than of the volume of the horizon. See Soil Taxonomy for additional information. 

Tidal phases of the Brynwood series are on tidal flats and have electrical conductivity values of between 16 and 24. These areas will be investigated during MLRA update activities to determine if a new series is needed. Brynwood soils with EC's greater than 16 would have saline-sodic properties that would change classification.

This soil was the Hallandale series. Hallandale has been re-classified to the isohyperhermic temperature regime. Brynwood replaces Hallandale in the hyperthermic temperature regime.

Taxonomic Version:  Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 12th Edition.
