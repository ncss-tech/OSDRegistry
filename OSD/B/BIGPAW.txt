BIGPAW SERIES

The Bigpaw series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material and alluvium derived from sandstone, siltstone, and quartz diorite.  Bigpaw soils are on toeslopes below mountain summits.  Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Bigpaw loam -- on a plane toeslope sloping 9 percent to the northeast at 8,880 feet elevation -- rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described, the soil was dry from 0 to 36 inches and moist below 36 inches.)

    2Btb2--57 to 65 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) stratified gravelly fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and few very fine roots; few fine and common very fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds and on rock fragments; 20 percent gravel, 5 percent cobble, and 5 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.8).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Jekley and Owlspring series.  Jekley soils are moderately deep to shale. Owlspring soils are somewhat poorly drained and formed in materials derived from basalt and basaltic tuff.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bigpaw soils are on toeslopes below domes of mountain summits.  They formed in eolian material and alluvium derived from Triassic and Jurassic sandstone and siltstone, and Tertiary quartz diorite.  Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 8,500 to 9,400 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 20 inches with more than 50 percent falling as snow from winter storms.  The mean annual air temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ligai, Pastorpeak, and Zibetod soils.  Ligai soils are loamy-skeletal and occur on warm backslopes of mountains.  Pastorpeak soils are loamy-skeletal and occur on north-facing backslopes of mountains.  Zibetod soils are loamy-skeletal, shallow, and occur on adjacent footslopes and shoulders of domes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Bigpaw soils are used for livestock grazing.  Present vegetation is muttongrass, western wheatgrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, and black sagebrush, with scattered common chokecherry and Gambel oak.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Bigpaw soils are of small extent on the Carrizo Mountains portion of the Colorado Plateau province in northeast Arizona.  LRR-D; MLRA 39.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - The zone from 0 to 48 inches  (A, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons)

Pachic subgroup - The presence of a mollic epipedon that is greater than 16 inches thick

Argillic horizon - The zone from 5 to 48 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons)

Lithologic discontinuity - The presence of a buried paleosol at 48 to more than 65 inches (2Btb1 and 2Btb2 horizons)

Keys to Soil Taxonomy - Soils classified according to the Ninth Edition, 2003.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Organic carbon values determined for one horizon from the type location by Inter-Mountain Laboratories, Inc.  The particle-size control sections of three pedons, including the type location, were wet sieved to determine percent of size fraction larger than very fine sand (less than 0.1mm).  The weighted averages of the three pedons ranged from 4 to 7 percent coarser than very fine sand.
