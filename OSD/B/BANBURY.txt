BANBURY SERIES

The Banbury series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in old alluvium from loess and weathered volcanic ash mixed with colluvium from basalt.  Banbury soils are on hills, terraces, terrace plains.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Lithic Xeric Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Banbury loam, rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 3 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak thick platy structure parting to weak medium and fine granular; soft, very friable; nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 3 inches thick)

    A2--3 to 5 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium and fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots; few very fine tubular and common very fine irregular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 3 inches thick)

    BA--5 to 10 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt1--10 to 14 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium and coarse subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; few fine tubular pores; few faint clay films in pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 7 inches thick)

    Bt2--14 to 17 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; few fine tubular pores; few faint clay films in pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt wavy boundary.  (2 to 7 inches thick)

    2R1--17 to 19 inches; fractured basalt; fragments are lime coated on underside.  (0 to 4 inches thick)

    2R2--19 inches; basalt.

TYPE LOCATION:  Twin Falls County, Idaho; 2 miles north of Buhl; SW 1/4, SW 1/4, NW 1/4 of section 24, T. 9 S., R. 14 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Average annual soil temperature - 50 to 55 degrees F.
Depth to bedrock - 10 to 20 inches
Reaction of solum - neutral through moderately alkaline
Organic matter - less than 1 percent below the A horizon
Moisture control section - moist less than 90 consecutive days when the soil temperature is greater than 47 degrees F.


A horizon
Value - 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist
Chroma - 2 or 3 dry or moist
Texture: L or SIL
Rock fragments: 0 to 25 percent total, with 0 to 15 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent gravel

Bt horizon
Value - 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist
Chroma - 2 through 4 dry or moist
Texture - L, CL, SIL or SICL
Clay content - 25 to 35 percent
Rock fragments - 0 to 20 percent total, mainly gravel with 0 to 5 percent cobbles

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bombadil, Dougal, Fubble, Jaybee, Kreza, and Meninik (T) series.  Bombadil soils have 15 to 25 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Dougal and Meninik soils are slightly acid or moderately acid in the Bt horizon.  Fubble soils have Bk horizons.  Jaybee soils have 35 to 45 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Kreza soils are less than 10 inches deep to bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Banbury soils are on hills, terraces, lava flow lobes, pressure ridges and tumuli on shield volcanoes and lava plains.  Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in old alluvium from loess and weathered volcanic ash mixed with colluvium from basalt.  Elevations are 3,000 to 4,500 feet. The average annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 11 inches.  Average annual temperature is 49 degrees to 54 degrees F.  The frost free season is 100 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Declo, Emberton, Escalante, Fathom, Harsan, Owinza, Paulville, and Suepert soils.  Declo, Escalante, Harsan, Paulville, and Suepert soils occur on higher terraces.  Declo, Escalante, Harsan and Paulville soils are very deep.  Suepert soils are moderately deep to a hardpan.  Emberton soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Fathom soils occur on lower terraces and breaks, are sandy, and very deep.  Owinza soils occur on depressional terraces, are fine, and very deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, slow through medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Banbury soils are used mainly for rangeland and irrigated pasture, with minor areas used for irrigated cropland.  The native vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Thurber needlegrass and Sandberg bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central and southwestern Idaho; MLRA 11.  Series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Twin Falls County, Idaho, 1992.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - 0 to 5 inches (A1 and A2 horizons) too thin for a mollic epipedon with the BA horizon having mollic colors but less than 1 percent organic matter.

Argillic horizon - 10 to 17 inches (Bt1 and Bt2)

Lithic contact - at 17 inches

Soil moisture regime - aridic bordering xeric.

Geographic setting - terms used throughout MLRA 11 to identify the setting of this soil are quite varied although all equate to the same landscape.  There will be further investigation from an MLRA project level as to the accepted terms for use.

The classification of this pedon has been revised as of 4/00 from loamy, mixed, mesic Lithic Xerollic Haplargids to loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Lithic Xeric Haplargids based on revision to Soil Taxonomy.
