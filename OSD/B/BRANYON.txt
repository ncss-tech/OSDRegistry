BRANYON SERIES

The Branyon series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous clayey alluvium derived from mudstone of Pleistocene age. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils occur on treads of stream terraces on river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 903 mm (35.6 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 19.9 degrees C (67.9 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, thermic Udic Haplusterts
