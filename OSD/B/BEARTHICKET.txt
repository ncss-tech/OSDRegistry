BEARTHICKET SERIES

The Bearthicket series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in silty alluvium. These soils are on nearly level flood plains and low stream terraces in MLRAs 116A and 116B. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches and mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Elk, Elkinsville, Olephant, Parke, Pike, Rickert, Tobinsport, Wellrock, and Wellston series. Elk soils have few to common mottles in shades of brown in the upper part of the Bt horizon and in shades of brown or gray in the lower part of the Bt horizon. Elkinsville soils have more than 35 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Olephant and Pike soils average 3 to 10 percent sand in the upper part of the series control section and have a 2Bt horizon. Parke soils have a 3Bt horizon that averages from 50 to 70 percent sand. Rickert soils average from 1 to 5 percent fine and coarser sand in the particle size control section. Tobinsport soils have a 3C/Bt horizon below 40 inches that averages from 65 to 85 percent sand. Wellrock soils have a paralithic contact from 40 to 60 inches. Wellston soils have bedrock at 40 to 72 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bearthicket soils are on flood plains and low stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. These soils formed in silty alluvium. Elevations are 400 to 1250 feet. Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches.
   
GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Britwater, Cedargap, Razort, Racket, Secesh, Sensabaugh series. All of these soils except Cedargap are fine-loamy. Britwater soils are on stream terraces and have redder colors in the argillic horizon. Cedargap soils are loamy-skeletal, have a mollic epipedon, have a higher base saturation, and are on flood plains. Razort, Racket, Secesh and Sensabaugh series are on similar positions. Razort soils have higher base saturation and have a dark colored surface horizon. Secesh soils have siliceous mineralogy. Sensabaugh and Racket series lack an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Runoff is negligible to low. Permeability is moderate.  The saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Some areas are subject to rare or occasional flooding.

USE AND VEGETATION: Hay and pasture. A few areas are used for cultivated crops. Native forest is mixed oaks.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Ozarks region (MLRAs 116A and 116B) of southern Missouri and possibly northern Arkansas. The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Laclede County, Missouri; 1997.

REMARKS: These soils were formerly mapped in the Elk series in Missouri.
Diagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are:
1)  Ochric epipedon: 0 to 10 inches (Ap)
2)  Argillic horizon: 10 to 80 inches (Bt horizons)

ADDITIONAL DATA: University of Missouri soil characterization laboratory sample number M92-105-92

The lab data shows this pedon is slightly under the 0.40 break for the active CEC class, but a summary of additional laboratory data shows the active family to be typical for this series.
