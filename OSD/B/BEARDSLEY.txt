BEARDSLEY SERIES

The Beardsley series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in mixed alluvium.  Beardsley soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 72 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, hyperthermic Vertic Argidurids

TYPICAL PEDON: Beardsley loam-rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

    A--0 to 3 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) loam, dark brown (7.5YR) moist; weak thin platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; common fine vesicular and few fine tubular pores; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick)

    Bt--3 to 10 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few thin patchy clay films; few fine tubular and few very fine interstitial pores; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (1 to 8 inches thick)

    Btk--10 to 36 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) clay; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm sticky and very plastic; common fine roots in upper part and common very fine roots in lower part; few thin clay films on faces of peds; many pressure faces on faces of peds; few very fine soft calcium carbonate masses; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (18 to 28 inches thick)

    2Bkqm--36 to 42 inches; pinkish white (5YR 8/2) and pinkish gray (5YR 7/2) indurated silica-calcium carbonate cemented duripan with thin laminar layer on upper surface; extremely hard, violently effervescent.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Beardsley soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 0 to 10 percent.  They formed in mixed alluvium dominated by volcanic rock.  Elevation ranges from 1000 to 2200 feet.  The climate is hot, arid continental.  Mean annual air temperature is 70 to 74 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 2 to 10 inches, occurring as thunderstorms in July, August and September, and as gentle rains in December and January.  Frost-free period is 240 to 325 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Carefree, Cipriano, Mohall, Tremant and Suncity soils.  Carefree soils are deep.  Cipriano soils are shallow and lack an argillic horizon.  Mohall and Tremant soils are fine-loamy.  Suncity soils are shallow and loamy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to medium runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for livestock grazing.  Native vegetation is big galleta, bush muhly, plains bristlegrass, Arizona cottontop, mesquite, littleleaf paloverde, triangleleaf bursage, creosotebush, threeawn, prickly-pear, saguaro and barrel cactus, cholla and Mormon-tea.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central and southern Arizona.  The Beardsley soil is not extensive. Total extent is about 4,900 acres.  MLRA is 40.
