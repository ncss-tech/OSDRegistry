BOWINGTON SERIES

The Bowington series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone. Bowington soils are on flood plain steps. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, mesic Oxyaquic Torripsamments

TYPICAL PEDON: Bowington fine sand is on a 3 percent slope at an elevation of 5197 feet. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(6 to 12 inches thick)

        C4--49 to 60 inches (125 to 152 cm); light gray (2.5Y 7/2) loamy fine sand, 50 percent bluish black (5PB 2.5/1), 50 percent reduced gray (N 5/0), moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, medium, coarse, and many fine roots; common very fine, fine and few medium tubular pores; 15 percent prominent clay films in root channels; 2 percent fine prominent irregular black manganese masses in the matrix; 50 percent prominent black organic staining in the matrix; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 12 inches thick)

        C5--60 to 62 inches (152 to 157 cm); light gray (2.5Y 7/1) loamy fine sand, 50 percent bluish black (5PB 2.5/1), 50 percent reduced gray (N 5/0) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine, medium, and coarse roots; few very fine, fine, and medium tubular pores; 7 percent prominent clay films in root channels; 2 percent fine prominent irregular black manganese masses in the matrix; 25 percent prominent black organic staining in the matrix; 10 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

TYPE LOCATION: Garfield County, UT; Calf Creek USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle; lat. 37 degrees 46 minutes 25.06 seconds N. and long. 111 degrees 25 minutes 40.77 seconds W., NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture:  Ustic aridic soil moisture regime based on precipitation. The soil moisture control section is saturated for brief periods of time during the months of July, August, and September.

Mean annual soil temperature: 47 to 58 degrees F. (8.3 to 14.4 degrees C.)

Depth to redox concentrations: 28 to 60 inches (71 to 152 cm)

Depth to redox depletions: 28 to 60 inches (71 to 152 cm)

Depth to endosaturation: 20 to 60 inches (50 to 152 cm) from July to September

Particle-size control section (weighted average):
Clay content: 0 to 15 percent
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent rounded gravel, cobble, and stones

Surface C horizon
Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR, 5YR
Value: 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist
Chroma: 3 to 5, dry or moist
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent rounded gravel and cobbles
Effervescence: noneffervescent to slightly effervescent
Reaction: neutral to moderately alkaline

C horizons
Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR, 2.5Y, 10YR
Value: 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 3 to 8, dry or moist
Texture: sand, fine sand, loamy sand, very fine sand, coarse sand, loamy fine sand
Clay content: 0 to 15 percent
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent rounded gravel, cobbles, and stones
Effervescence: noneffervescent to strongly effervescent
Reaction: neutral to moderately alkaline
Note: 2C horizons have gley colors common for a reduced matrix caused by the depletion of iron

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Fernley (NV) series.  Fernley soils has hue of 10YR and 2.5YR and formed under the climatic conditions of the Great Basin will cool moist winters and hot dry summers.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bowington soils are on floodplain steps at elevations of 3,960 to 6,020 feet (1,207 to1,768 m).  They formed in alluvium derived from sandstone.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 55 degrees F (7.2 to 11.1 degrees C.). and the mean annual precipitation is 9 to 13 inches (229 to 305 mm).  The frost-free period ranges from 120 to 175 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Mespun and Calcree.  Mespun soils are on benches and are formed from eolian sands.  Calcree soils are on stream bottoms, are moderately deep to bedrock, and are poorly drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained, low runoff, rapid permeability, occasional flooded for 1-2 sequences per year during the months of July to September.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and recreation. Potential natural plant community is coyote willow, yellow willow, streamside wildrye, Fremont cottonwood, western wheatgrass, basin big sagebrush, rubber rabbitbrush, and scattered forbs. This soil has been correlated to the Semiwet Fresh Streambank (Fremont Cottonwood) 035XY014UT ecological site at the type location in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Utah, Bowington is of small extent. LRR D, MLRA 35
