BEAVERCREEK SERIES 

The Beavercreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly and cobbly loamy recent alluvial and colluvial sediments.  These soils are on flood plains and alluvial fans below steep to very steep hill slopes.  Slope ranges from 1 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 790 millimeters, and mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, active, nonacid, mesic Typic Udifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Beavercreek cobbly fine sandy loam on a slightly concave slope of 6 percent on an alluvial fan in a pastured forest. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

   A--0 to 13 centimeters; brown (10YR 4/3) cobbly fine sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; about 15 percent cobbles; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 38 centimeters thick) 

   C1--13 to 30 centimeters; stratified brown (10YR 5/3) and pale brown (10YR 6/3) cobbly fine sand and pale brown (10YR 6/3) and dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) cobbly silt loam; massive; very friable; about 15 percent cobbles; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 38 centimeters thick) 

   C2--30 to 152 centimeters; stratified dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), brown (10YR 5/3) and pale brown (10YR 6/3) very cobbly silt loam, very cobbly fine sandy loam, and very cobbly fine sand and very cobbly sand; massive; very friable; about 15 percent pebbles and 40 percent cobbles, mostly dolomite; neutral. 

TYPE LOCATION:  Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) 105-Northern Mississippi Valley Loess Hills, Houston County, Minnesota; located about 4 miles east of Caledonia, Minnesota; about 1200 feet south and 1200 feet west of the northeast corner of section 22, T. 102 N., R. 5 W. USGS Caledonia topographic quadrangle; latitude 43 degrees, 37 minutes, 38 seconds N. and longitude 91 degrees, 25 minutes, 0 seconds W. NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Thickness of loamy mantle--13 to 51 centimeters;  
Depth to free carbonates--typically absent to depths of 102 centimeters or more, but are at depths as shallow as 51 centimeters in some pedons
Content of clay in the particle-size control section (weighted average)--5 to 18 percent
Rock fragment content--cobbles and gravel cover 0 to 50 percent of the surface; 5 to 35 percent in the loamy mantle, mostly pebbles and cobblestones; the C horizon contains 35 to 75 percent coarse fragments, mostly pebbles and cobblestones; coarse fragments consist of sandstone, dolomite, and limestone 

A horizon:
Hue10YR
Value--3 through 5; 4 or more when the upper 18 centimeters is mixed
Chroma--2 or 3
Texture--fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam or their cobbly analogs. Thin, finer, or coarser textured strata are in many pedons
Reaction--slightly acid or neutral

C horizon:
Hue--10YR or 2.5Y
Value--3 through 6
Chroma--2 through 4
Texture--stratified textures of sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, loam, or silt loam with 15 to 75 percent coarse fragments.
Reaction--neutral or mildly alkaline. 

A buried soil is below depths of 102 centimeters in some pedons. 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Beanblossom, Bloomsdale, and Elsah series.
Beanblossom, Bloomsdale, and Elsah--all have a warmer climate. In addition, Beanblossom--are more acid in the control section;
Bloomsdale--have more clay in the control section;
Elsah--contain more silt and less sand. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent Material-- loamy-skeletal colluvium and alluvium.
Landform-- flood plains along the upper reaches of streams with high velocities and on alluvial fans at the mouths of drainageways that dissect very steep hill slopes
Slope--1 to 15 percent
Elevation200 to 400 meters above sea level
Mean annual precipitation711 to 864 millimeters
Mean annual air temperature8 to 11 degrees C
Frost-free period145 to 205 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arenzville, Huntsville, and Newalbin soils on nearby flood plains.
Arenzville and Newalbin--formed in recent silty sediments.  Arenzville soils are moderately well and well drained and Newalbin soils are poorly and very poorly drained
Huntsville--have a thick mollic epipedon, and are on parts of the flood plain that have lower velocities during floods

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--well drained, a saturated zone does not occur within a depth of 1.8 meters during April to June in normal years
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--14.1-42.3 micrometers per second (moderately rapid) throughout
Surface runoff potentialmedium
Floodingoccassional to frequent flooding for very brief duration

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of these soils are in pasture and forest. Native vegetation is deciduous forest. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  

Physiographic division--Interior Plains
Physiographic Province--Central Lowland
Physiographic sections--Wisconsin driftless section, 
MLRAs--Northern Mississippi Valley Loess Hills (105)
LRR M--southeastern Minnesota, southwestern Wisconsin, northwestern Illinois and possibly north-eastern Iowa
Extent--moderate 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Houston County, Minnesota, 1981. 

REMARKS:  The Beavercreek soils were mostly mapped as a miscellaneous land type in the past such as stony colluvial or alluvial land.  The moderately well drained phase was removed during La Crosse County final correlation.
