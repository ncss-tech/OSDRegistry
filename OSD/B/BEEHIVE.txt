BEEHIVE SERIES

The Beehive series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on floodplains.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed Oxyaquic Cryofluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Beehive gravelly sandy loam, forested (Colors are for dry unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; slightly decomposed forest litter consisting of needles, twigs and bark. (1 to 2 inches thick)

    A--2 to 5 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few coarse roots, common fine and very fine roots; 20 percent pebbles, 10 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 9 inches thick)

    C1--5 to 20 inches; variegated extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand; massive; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few coarse and medium roots, common very fine roots; 50 percent pebbles, 20 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 25 inches thick)

    C2--20 to 28 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few coarse and medium roots, common fine and very fine roots; 35 percent pebbles, 15 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 15 inches thick)

    C3--28 to 60 inches; variegated extremely cobbly loamy sand; massive; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few medium and very fine roots; 35 percent pebbles, 40 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 

Landform - floodplains.
Elevation - 5,500 to 7,500 feet.
Slope - 0 to 8 percent.
Parent material - alluvium.
Climate - long cold winters; cool, moist springs; short summers.
Mean annual precipitation - 20 to 25 inches.
Mean annual air temperature - 34 to 39 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 50 to 70 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Beehive soils are used mainly for wildlife habitat. Potential native vegetation may include 
lodgepole pine, Engelmann spruce, pinegrass, elksedge, kinnikinnick and horsetail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Beehive soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Gallatin County, Montana, 1997.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record: MT1437. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: an ochric epipedon from the surface to 3 inches (A horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (C1, C2 and C3 horizons).  Beehive soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
