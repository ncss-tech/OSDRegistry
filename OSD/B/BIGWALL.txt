BIGWALL SERIES

The Bigwall series consists of very deep, well-drained soils on terraces of mountain valley floors. Bigwall soils formed in volcanic ash overlying mixed alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Ashy, amorphic, frigid Typic Vitrixerands 

TYPICAL PEDON: Bigwall ashy silt loam - woodland, on a 14 percent, south-facing slope at an elevation of 4,760 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted. Soil textures are apparent field textures.)

	Oi--0 to 1 inches; needles, twigs, branches. 

	A--1 to 6 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) ashy silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine and very fine subangular blocky; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; weakly smeary; many very fine, fine and few medium roots; common very fine and few fine irregular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

	Bw--6 to 25 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) ashy silt loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) dry; weak medium, subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine and very fine subangular blocky; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; weakly smeary; common very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; few fine tubular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary.
