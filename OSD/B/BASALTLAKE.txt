COMPETING SERIES: These are the Butchlake, Cuberant, Enentah, Garlet, Gromes, Soakpak, Storm, Targhee, and Telay series. Butchlake and Telay soils lack buried A horizons and mottles in the substratum. Cuberant and Targhee soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Enentah soils have spodic materials in the solum. Garlet soils have calcium carbonate in the solum. Gromes and Storm soils have greater than 15 percent clay in the particle size control section. Soakpak soils need to be redefined.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landforms: mountains
Parent material: silty eolian deposits over gravelly till or colluvium
Elevation: 2,244 to 3,812 feet (684 to 1,162 m)
Slope: 12 to 75 percent
Annual precipitation: 28 to 40 inches (700 to 1,010 mm)
Annual temperature: 25 degrees F (-4 degrees C)
Frost-free period: 50 to 80 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Castnot, Elting, Petrokov, and Sonderna soils. Castnot, Elting, and Sonderna soils are well drained, very deep, and occur on mountains. Petrokov soils are somewhat excessively drained, very deep, and occur on mountains and outwash plains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, medium to high runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat and recreation. Native vegetation is green alder/red current/bluejoint scrub.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 228, Interior Alaska Mountains, Alaska. The series is of small extent.
