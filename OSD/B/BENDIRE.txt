BENDIRE SERIES

The Bendire series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic, igneous or metamorphic rock. Bendire soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 432 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Bendire gravelly loam, on a 23 percent east facing slope within a twoneedle pinyon-Arizona fescue plant community. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 13 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 20 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (12 to 25 cm thick)

    Bt1--13 to 25 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly clay loam; dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 30 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (13 to 20 cm thick)

    Bt2--25 to 36 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; common prominent clay films on faces of peds; hard, very firm, sticky and plastic; 30 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. 

    Bt3--36 to 69 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; few distinct clay films on faces of peds; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; 40 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of Bt2 and Bt3 horizons is 20 to 48 cm)

    R--69 cm; andesite bedrock.
