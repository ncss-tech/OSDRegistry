BOCA SERIES

The Boca series consists of moderately deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils that formed in sandy and loamy marine sediments deposited over limestone bedrock. Boca soils are on low broad flats, poorly defined drainageways, depressions, and adjacent tidal flats in areas of the flatwoods. Slopes are linear to slightly convex or concave and range from 0 to 2 percent. Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 1397 millimeters (55 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, siliceous, superactive, isohyperthermic Arenic Endoaqualfs

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama. 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: 
Broward County; Florida, 1973 

REMARKS: 
Temperature regime updated from hyperthermic to isohyperthermic 8-2022.

Particle size control section: 64 to 81 centimeters (25 to 32 inches)

In the isohyperthermic temperature regime, chroma up to 4 is tentatively permitted in the Bt horizon if the hue is 2.5Y or 5Y and if mottles are distinct or prominent. 

There is a tidal phase map unit that has reaction of strongly alkaline; these areas need to be investigated because there could be saline/sodic properties.

Ponded and depressional phases need to be investigated to determine if a new series is necessary.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon: 

Ochric epipedon - 0 to 64 centimeters [0 to 25 inches (Ap, E, EB horizons)] 

Albic horizon - 18 to 33 centimeters [7 to 13 inches (E horizon)]

Argillic horizon - 64 to 81 centimeters [25 to 32 inches (Btg horizon)]

Soil Series was classified according to the 12th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.
