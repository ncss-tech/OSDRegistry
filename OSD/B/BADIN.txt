BADIN SERIES

The Badin series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in residuum weathered from fine-grained metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks of the Carolina Slate Belt. These soils are on gently sloping to steep uplands in the Piedmont. Slopes range from 2 to 55 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 47 inches and mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F. near the type location. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, semiactive, thermic Typic Hapludults 

TYPICAL PEDON: Badin channery silt loam, on a complex convex 4 percent slope in cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

  Ap--0 to 6 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) channery silt loam; weak medium granular structure; very friable; common fine roots; slate fragments 1/8 inch to 2 inches in size and make up 35 percent by volume; moderately acid; abrupt wavy boundary. (2 to 8 inches thick) 

  BA--6 to 9 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) channery silty clay loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine roots; few faint clay films on faces of peds; slate fragments 1/8 inch to 2 inches in size and make up 25 percent by volume; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. (0 to 4 inches thick) 

  Bt1--9 to 18 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/8) silty clay; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; common faint clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent slate fragments; extremely acid; gradual wavy boundary. 

  Bt2--18 to 25 inches; mottled red (2.5YR 5/8), yellowish red (5YR 5/8), and strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) channery silty clay loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; few distinct clay films on faces of peds; 30 percent slate fragments; extremely acid; clear irregular boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 10 to 28 inches.) 

  Cr--25 to 40 inches; weathered highly fractured fine-grained metasedimentary rock; few seams of silt loam in cracks. 

  R--40 inches; unweathered, fractured fine-grained metasedimentary rock. 

TYPE LOCATION: Stanly County, North Carolina; 0.7 mile north of Anderson Grove Church in Albemarle on Secondary Road 1537; and 100 yards east of road in cultivated field. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is 20 to 40 inches. Depth to weathered bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. Depth to hard bedrock is 40 inches or more. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to extremely acid in all horizons except where the surface has been limed. Limed soils are typically moderately acid or slightly acid in the A horizon. Rock fragment content is commonly 5 to 35 percent by volume in the A, E, BE, BA, and Bt horizons, and 20 to 60 percent in the BC and C horizons. Some pedons have individual horizons that have 0 to 5 percent rock fragments by volume. Fragments are dominantly channers. 

The A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 8. In uneroded or slightly eroded pedons, it is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine earth fraction. In eroded pedons, the Ap horizon may be silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction. 

The E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 8. It is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. 

The BA horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. 

The BE horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. It is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. 

The Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. It is silty clay, silty clay loam, clay loam or clay in the fine-earth fraction and has 35 to 60 percent clay and more than 30 percent silt. Some pedons have mottles in shades or red, yellow, or brown.

The BC horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8, or is mottled in shades of these colors. It is silty clay loam, clay loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction. 

The C horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8, or is mottled in shades of these colors. It is silty clay loam or silt loam saprolite, in the fine-earth fraction. 

The Cr horizon is weathered, fractured fine-grained metasedimentary rock. 

The R horizon, where present, is unweathered, fractured fine-grained 
metasedimentary rock. 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Albertville, Bengal, Brockroad, Carnasaw, Catharpin, Cunningham, Cuthbert, Galilee, Kirvin, Luverne, Masada, Mayodan, McQueen, Nason, Remlap, Sweatman, Tatum, Townley, Urland, Uwharrie, and Vance series in the same family. Albertville soils formed in residuum from shale and have a depth to soft bedrock of 40 to 60 inches. Bengal soils have a stony surface layer, high shrink-swell potential, and are slowly permeable. Brockroad and Catharpin soils have a lithologic discontinuity within the series control section. Carnasaw soils formed in residuum from shale and have a depth to soft bedrock of 40 to 60 inches. Cunningham soils formed in residuum from shale and 
have a depth to soft bedrock of 30 to 56 inches. Cuthbert and Galilee soils formed in residuum from sandstone and shale. Kirvin soils formed in residuum from shale and have a depth to soft bedrock of 40 to 60 inches. Luverne soils formed from stratified marine sediments. Masada and McQueen soils formed in alluvial sediments and are very deep. Mayodan soils formed in residuum from Triassic Basin sediments and are very deep. Nason and Tatum soils formed in residuum from schist and have a depth to soft bedrock of 40 to 60 inches. Remlap soils formed in residuum from interbedded shale and are very deep. Sweatman soils formed in marine sediments consisting of thinly bedded clayey shales and sandy and loamy material and are very deep. Townley soils formed in residuum 
from interbedded shale and sandstone. Urland soils formed in coastal plain sediments and stratified sandstone. Uwharrie and Vance soils are very deep. Of these series, only Catharpin, Masada, Mayodan, McQueen, Nason, Tatum, Uwharrie, and Vance soils occur in the Southern Piedmont MLRA 136. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Badin soils are on gently sloping to steep uplands in the Piedmont. Slope gradients are commonly 4 to 25 percent, but range from 2 to 55 percent slopes. They formed in residuum weathered from fine-grained metasedimentary rocks such as argillites. Mean annual precipitation is 47 inches and mean annual air temperature is 60 degrees F. near the type location. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: In addition to the competing Uwharrie series, these are Callison, Cid, Georgeville, Goldston, Herndon, Kirksey, Lignum, Misenheimer, Montonia, Nanford, Pageland, Secrest, and Tarrus series. Cid soils are moderately well or somewhat poorly drained and are on toe slopes and around heads of drains. Georgeville and Herndon soils lack Cr horizons within 60 inches of the surface and occur on smoother landscapes. Goldston soils are shallow, lack continuous Bt horizons, and occur on more broken topography. Kirksey and Lignum soils have low chroma mottles in the control section and occur on smoother lower parts of the landscape. Misenheimer soils are shallow, lack a Bt 
horizon, and occur on smoother lower parts of the landscape. Montonia soils are fine-loamy. Nanford and Tarrus soils have a depth to weathered bedrock (Cr) of 40 to 60 inches. Pageland soils are Alfisols. Secrest soils have a fine-silty particle size control section. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to very rapid runoff; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for growing corn, small grain, soybeans, grain sorghum, mixed hay, and pasture. The remainder is in woodlands of oaks, hickory, loblolly pine, shortleaf pine, Virginia pine, and yellow-poplar. Common understory species are American holly, flowering dogwood, sourwood, and American hornbeam. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Piedmont Plateau of North Carolina and Virginia. The series is of moderate extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Cabarrus County, North Carolina; 1983. 

REMARKS: This soil was formerly included in the Nason and Tatum series. However, those soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 6 inches (Ap horizon). 
Argillic horizon - the zone from a depth of 6 inches to a depth of 25 inches (BA, Bt1 and Bt2 horizons). 
Paralithic contact - the presence of weathered, fractured slate at a depth of 25 inches. 
Lithic contact - the presence of unweathered, slightly fractured slate at a depth of 40 inches.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Soils similar to Badin were characterized as Herndon slaty silt loam (S65NC-84-5(1-5) by Beltsville laboratory. The COLE values are thought to be in error.
