BEMAN SERIES

The Beman series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Beman soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Haplustolls
TYPICAL PEDON:  Beman fine sandy loam, on a north facing, convex, 3 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 6760 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on July 8, 1996 the soil was dry throughout.

    A--0 to 2 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots between peds; neutral; noneffervescent; 5 percent subangular mixed gravel; abrupt wavy boundary.  (2 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw--2 to 8 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine and medium prismatic structure parting to strong fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many fine to coarse roots between peds; slightly alkaline; noneffervescent; 5 percent subangular mixed gravel; clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 20 inches thick)

    Bk1--8 to 22 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine prismatic structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine to coarse roots between peds; 8.0 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; common fine irregular carbonate threads throughout; moderately alkaline; 10 percent subangular mixed gravel; gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 20 inches thick)

    Bk2--22 to 37 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few fine to coarse roots between peds; 8.0 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; common fine irregular carbonate threads throughout; moderately alkaline; 10 percent subangular mixed gravel; gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 20 inches thick)

    Bk3--37 to 53 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine to coarse roots between peds;  8.0 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; common fine irregular carbonate threads throughout; moderately alkaline; 10 percent subangular mixed gravel; clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 20 inches thick)

    Bk4--53 to 65 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots in cracks; 5.0 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; common fine irregular carbonate threads throughout; moderately alkaline.  (0 to 20 inches thick)

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Arnegard (ND), Bowery (MT), and Lobe (CO) series.  Potential competitors not yet reclassified are Falkirk (ND), Garlips (CO), Garza (WY), Lonecone (CO), Obrein (MT), Roseglen (ND), Shawa (CO), and Sheckle (UT) series.  Arnegard soils are moist in the spring and summer.  Bowery and Sheckle soils have no carbonates and are medium acid to neutral.  Falkirk soils have gravelly loam 2C horizons and glacial till within 40 inches.  Garlips and Roseglen soils have calcic horizons.  Garza soils have no visible carbonate accumulations and have less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Lobe soils are poorly drained.  Lonecone soils are moderately deep.  Obrein soils have high bulk density and formed in till.  Shawa soils have no carbonates above 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Beman soils.
Parent material:  Alluvium derived from mixed sources.
Landform:  Alluvial fans and fan remnants.
Slopes:  0 to 8 percent
Elevation: 6000 to 7200 feet
