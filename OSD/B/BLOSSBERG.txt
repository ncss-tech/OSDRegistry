BLOSSBERG SERIES

The Blossberg series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils on flood plains, depressions, drainageways, alluvial fans and stream terraces.  These soils formed in loamy alluvium 20 to 40 inches deep over sand and gravel.  Slope is 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Blossberg loam, 0 to 4 percent slopes, in pasture (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 14 inches; black (10YR 2/1) loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; many large prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redox concentrations, dry; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots, many very fine and fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 15 inches thick)

    Bg1--14 to 23 inches; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) dry; many coarse prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) redox concentrations, dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual smooth boundary.

    Bg2--23 to 28 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) gravelly loam, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) dry; few fine prominent red (2.5YR 5/8) redox concentrations, dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 20 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of Bg horizons is 10 to 30 inches.)

    2Cg--28 to 60 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very cobbly loamy coarse sand, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; common coarse prominent red (2.5YR 5/8) redox concentrations, dry; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 20 percent gravel, 35 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).
