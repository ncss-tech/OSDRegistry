BLOOMING SERIES

The Blooming series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in 35 to 60 centimeters of silty or loamy sediments and the underlying calcareous, loamy glacial till. These soils are on convex slopes on ground moraines and end moraines. Slope ranges from 1 to 18 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Steele County, Minnesota, 1972.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 38 to 88 centimeters (2Bt1, 2Bt2, and 2Bt3 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (Ap, BE, 2Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3, 2Bt4, and 2C horizons). 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 20 centimeters (Ap horizon);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 38 to 122 centimeters (2Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3, and 2Bt4 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

In parts of MLRA 103 this drainage class is called moderately well drained based on the Soil Survey Manual. Drainage class is a state interpretation.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
