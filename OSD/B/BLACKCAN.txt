BLACKCAN SERIES

The Blackcan series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and basalt with minor amounts of quartzite and limestone. Blackcan soils are on fan remnants and ballenas. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Xeric Haplodurids 

TYPICAL PEDON: Blackcan very gravelly sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered with about 50 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles.

    Bqkm2--66 to 92 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) cemented material, light gray (10YR 7/2) moist; moderate thick platy structure; extremely hard, slightly rigid; strongly cemented by secondary silica and calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; gradual smooth boundary. (25 to 61 cm thick)

    Bqkm3--92 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) cemented material, light gray (10YR 7/2) moist; massive; very hard, extremely firm; moderately cemented by secondary silica and calcium carbonate; violently effervescent.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lincoln County, Nevada; about 13 miles west-southwest of Panaca and 10 feet southwest of jeep trail; approximately 180 feet east and 1,380 feet north of the southwest corner of section 18, T. 2 S., R. 66 E.; USGS The Bluffs 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 37 degrees 46 minutes 16.9 seconds N and longitude 114 degrees 38 minutes 28.0 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 37.7713611 latitude, -114.6411111 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist for short periods in winter and early spring and intermittently moist in some part for 10 to 20 days cumulative from July through September due to convection storms; aridic soil moisture regime that borders on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 11 to 13 degrees C.
Depth to calcic horizon: 5 to 10 cm.
Depth to duripan: 36 to 50 cm.
Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.
Mineralogy: 12 to 25 percent volcanic glass in the 0.02 to 2 mm fraction and averages 0.01 to 0.09 percent Al plus Fe, extracted by ammonium oxalate.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 8 to 18 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Gravden, Gunnel, Jericho, Karpp, Lien, and Rekima series.

Gravden, Gunnel, Karpp, and Rekima soils are not intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative from July through September due to convection storms.  Jericho soils have a duripan that ranges less than 51 cm in thickness and also have C horizons.  Lien soils have a duripan that ranges less than 51 cm in thickness and the mean annual soil temperature is 8.5 to 11 degrees C. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Blackcan soils are on fan remnants and ballenas. They typically occur on summit and shoulder positions.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and basalt with minor amounts of quartzite and limestone. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. Elevations range from 1,494 to 2,073 meters. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Geer, Kyler, and Ursine soils. Geer soils are located on fan skirts and inset fans, and do not have a duripan. Kyler soils are on hills and mountains and are shallow to a lithic contact. Ursine soils are on fan remnants, are shallow to a duripan, and have carbonatic mineralogy.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Blackcan soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The potential native vegetation includes black sagebrush, Nevada ephedra, Indian ricegrass, and galleta. This pedon is correlated to ecological site R029XY008NV, Shallow Calcareous Loam 8-12 P.Z.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: East-central Nevada. These soils are not extensive with about 7,100 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 29.
