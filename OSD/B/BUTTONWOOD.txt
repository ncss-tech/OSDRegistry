GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
These are the Broadaxe, Endeavor, Ittsanapper, Mullet, Tea Hammock soils.
Broadaxe soils--are on submerged wave-cut platforms and are much sandier throughout
Endeavor soils--are on relict flood-tidal delta sand flats and slopes, have sandier textures, and have considerable shell fragments throughout
Ittsanapper soils--are on lagoon bottom landforms, at deeper water depths, and have thicker finer textured materials throughout
Mullet soils--are on washover fan flats and have sandy textures throughout
Tea Hammock soils--are also on nearby anthropogenic landforms consisting of dredge-deposit shoals

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--Subaqueous
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--High or very high
Soil moisture regime--Peraquic
Soil is continuously inundated by saline and brackish water.

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major uses--Used for recreational boating, fishing, and swimming, marinas, mooring fields, and commercial shellfish harvesting; benthic species include tubeworms, clams, crabs, scallops and juvenile finfish 
Native vegetation--Dominant vegetation is driven by water quality and quantity within subaqueous systems. Under excellent water quality these soils support seagrass species including but not limited to shoal grass (Halodule wrightii), manatee grass (Syringodium filiforme), and star grass (Halophila engelmannii). Shallower areas may support widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima). Under degraded / poor water quality seagrass may be replaced by rooted eukaryotic macroalgae in the green (Chlorophyta), red (Rhodophyta), and brown (Phaeophyta) algae families. Caulerpa prolifera (Chlorophyta) is often dominant. Vegetative cover ranges from 0 through 20 percent.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
General area--Located along the coasts of Indian River Lagoon, Florida
Land Resource Regions--U - Florida Subtropical Fruit, Truck Crop, and Range Region
MLRA(s)--155
Extent--Small
