BENZONIA SERIES

The Benzonia series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in sandy deposits on outwash plains, moraines, and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, isotic, mesic Lamellic Haplorthods

TYPICAL PEDON: Benzonia sand, on a west-facing, convex, 2 percent slope in a forested area at an elevation of 845 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated. When described on June 30, 1996, the soil was moist throughout.)

 A--0 to 13 cm (5 inches); 50 percent black (5YR 2.5/1) and 50 percent dark reddish brown (5YR 2.5/2) sand, dark gray (N 4/) dry; weak medium granular structure; very friable; many very fine to coarse roots throughout; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. [5 to 13 cm (2 to 5 inches) thick]

 E--13 to 28 cm (5 to 11 inches); reddish gray (5YR 5/2) sand, pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many very fine to coarse roots throughout; strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. [5 to 15 cm (2 to 6 inches) thick]

 Bhs1--28 to 38 cm (11 to 15 inches); dark reddish brown (5YR 2.5/2) sand; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; many very fine to coarse roots throughout; strongly acid; clear irregular boundary. 

 Bhs2--38 to 51 cm (15 to 20 inches); dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) sand; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; many very fine to coarse roots throughout; strongly acid; clear irregular boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bhs horizon is 13 to 23 cm (5 to 9 inches).]

 Bs1--51 to 69 cm (20 to 27 inches); dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) sand; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; many very fine to coarse roots throughout; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. 

 Bs2--69 to 89 cm (27 to 35 inches); strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) sand; massive; very friable; many very fine to coarse roots throughout; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bs horizon is 13 to 48 cm (5 to 19 inches).]

 E and Bt--89 to 284 cm (35 to 112 inches); about 95 percent brown (7.5YR 5/4) sand (E); single grain; loose; about 5 percent brown (7.5YR 4/4) loamy sand (Bt) consisting of several wavy and discontinuous lamellae 3 to 6 mm (1/8 to 1/4 inch) thick [(total thickness equals 8 cm (3 inches)]; massive; friable; few fine roots throughout; common faint brown clay bridges between sand grains (Bt); moderately acid.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. Similar soils in related families are the Benona series. Benona series do not have a Bhs horizon and are not in the isotic mineralogy family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Benzonia soils are on outwash plains, lake plains, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. The Benzonia soils formed in sandy deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 813 mm (30 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.3 to 9.4 degrees C (47 to 49 degrees F). Frost-free period is 120 to 160 days. Elevation is 183 to 305 meters (600 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brethren, Coloma, Dair, Grattan, Kaleva, Kalkaska, and Saugatuck soils. Brethren, Dair, and Saugatuck soils are wetter members of a drainage sequence with the Benzonia soils. Coloma, Grattan, and Kaleva soils are on similar landscape positions as the Benzonia soils. Kalkaska soils are in adjoining areas mapped in the frigid temperature regime.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat excessively drained. Potential for surface runoff is low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high. Permeability is rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are forested or are idle. Some areas are used for orchard crops.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 96 in northwestern lower peninsula of Michigan. The series is of moderate extent.
