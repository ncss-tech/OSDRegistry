USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses: Most areas are in natural vegetation and used for wildlife habitat. 
Dominant Vegetation: Where wooded, dominant vegetation consists of stunted pitch pine (Pinus rigida) and Atlantic white cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides), or remnants of these species ("ghost" forests) where inundation by saline water is more frequent. Marsh areas consist of saltmeadow cordgrass (Spartina patens), saltmarsh cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora), saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), marsh-elder (Iva frutescens), poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans), and groundsel-tree (Baccharis halimifolia).

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Distribution: New Jersey. This series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Ocean County, New Jersey, 2023. The name is taken from the surrounding estuary and town of Barnegat, Barnegat Bay, Barnegat Inlet, and Barnegat Light.  The concept was developed during the blue carbon sampling and Ocean County tidal marsh mapping update, similar to the concept of the Sunken soil series mapped in Delaware and Maryland.  

REMARKS: Barnegat soils were previously mapped as Appoquinimink-Transquaking-Mispillion soils and Atsion tide flooded soils in New Jersey.

The Barnegat series is a relict / submerged Spodosol that now classifies as an Entisol due to saturation by alkaline saline water, which increases the pH above the limit (pH 5.9) that defines spodic materials.  

Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:
Histic Epipedon-the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 20 centimeters (8 inches) (Oese horizon)
Aquic conditions-the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 180 centimeters (71 inches).
Albic Horizon-the zone from 35 to 52 centimeters (14 to 20 inches) (Eg horizon)
Spodic Horizon (relict) -the zone from 52 to 108 centimeters (20 to 43 inches) (Bhsse and Bs horizons) (relict spodic horizon, doesn't meet the definition of spodic materials due to pH greater than 5.9)
Sulfidic materials-the zone from 0 to 35 centimeters (0 to 14 inches) (Oese and Aseg horizons) and the zone from 52 to 87 centimeters (20 to 34 inches) (Bhsse horizon)
