BUZZARDSPRINGS SERIES

The Buzzardsprings series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium from igneous rock. The Buzzardsprings soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters (4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.5 degrees C (71 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, hyperthermic Typic Haplocalcids

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Oldad (CA) and Superstition (AZ+CA) series. Oldad soils have a calcic horizon with an upper boundary between 50 and 100 centimeters. Superstition soils do not receive appreciable summer precipitation, are generally dry throughout the moisture control section for most of the year and are formed in sandy eolian deposits. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Buzzardsprings soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from igneous rock. Elevations range from 290 to 730 meters (950 to 2,400 feet). The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 millimeters (3 to 5 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 20 to 23 degrees C (68 to 73.5 degrees F). The frost-free season is 300 to 340 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aquapeak and Dalelake soils. Aquapeak soils are on similar landscape positions and have an argillic horizon above a duripan. Dalelake soils are on sand sheets, have a sandy particle-size control section dominated by fine sand and do not have a calcic horizon. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat excessively drained; very low or low runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Buzzardsprings soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly creosote bush and burrobush.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Mojave Desert of southeastern California. MLRA 30. These soils are of small extent.
