BARX SERIES

The Barx series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or slope alluvium, including reworked eolian material derived from sandstone. These soils are on fan remnants, structural benches, dipslopes, plateaus and mesas. Slopes are from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 279 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Grand County Utah - Central Part, 1985. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 18 cm (A and part of the Bw horizon)
Cambic horizon - from 8 to 23 cm (Bw horizon)
Argillic horizon - from 23 to 91 cm (Bt1, Bt2 and Btk horizons)
Calcic horizon - from 91 to 152 cm (BCk1, BCk2 and BCk3 horizons)
Particle-size control section - from 23 to 73 cm (Bt1, Bt2 and part of the Btk horizon)

Barx soils have a mesic temperature regime and an aridic moisture regime bordering on ustic.

Note: the type location should be investigated to verify massive structure in the BCk horizons.
