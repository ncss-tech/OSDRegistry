BOWNS SERIES

The Bowns series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils with very slow permeability that formed in a thin mantle of loess mixed with colluvium from basalt over silty alluvium from loess and weathered volcanic ash. Bowns soils are on plains and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Xeric Paleargids

    3R--35 inches; highly jointed and fractured basalt.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Acoma, Berdugo, Biscaro (T), Borda, Chardoton, Gooding, Hagata (T), Jowee, Locey (T), Lodico (T), Poall, Reba and Spangenburg series.  Acoma, Berdugo, Borda, Brent, Chardoton, Gooding, Jowee, Poall, Reba, and Spangenburg soils are greater than 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Biscaro and Hagata soils are over paralithic contacts and lack calcium carbonate.  Locey and Lodico soils lack calcium carbonate and E horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bowns soils are on lava flow lobes on shield volcanoes.  Elevations range from 3,000 to 3,200 feet. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in a thin mantle of loess mixed with colluvium from basalt over silty alluvium from loess and weathered volcanic ash. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 9 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 52 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Banbury, Chilcott, Catchell, Power and Purdam soils and the competing Chardoton soils.  Power and Purdam soils lack bedrock at a depth of less than 40 inches. Catchell and Chilcott soils have a duripan at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Banbury soils are less than 20 inches deep to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow through rapid runoff; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The Bowns soils are used mainly for range and some small areas are irrigated.  Natural vegetation is Sandberg bluegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, Thurber needlegrass, Wyoming big sagebrush and littleleaf horsebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Ada County, Idaho; MLRA 11.. These soils are inextensive.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 7 inches (A and E horizons)

Abrupt textural change - 

Argillic horizon - the zone from 7 to 28 inches (2Bt1, 2Bt2, and 2Btkn horizons)

Particle-size control section - the zone from 7 to 27 inches

Soil moisture regime - aridic bordering xeric

Of the 12,983 acres previously mapped as the Bowns soil, about 50 percent has been correlated to the Catchell series through the MLRA 11 update process and Orchard Training Area Project, 1999.  Some areas still mapped as the Bowns series have tested high in electrical conductivity in the lower part of the argillic horizon which may indicate the presence of a natric horizon.  Further investigation is needed during the update process.

The classification of this pedon has been revised from Xerollic Paleargids to Xeric Paleargids based on revision to Soil Taxonomy.
