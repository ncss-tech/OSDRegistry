BLACKTANK SERIES

The Blacktank series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium from tephra. Blacktank soils are on alluvial fans, and washes. Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy, glassy, mesic Sodic Haplocambids

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Blacktank soils are on alluvial fans of cinders and ash at elevations of 4,662 to 5,705 feet (1,421 to 1,739 meters). Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from tephra deposits. The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches (152 to 254 millimeters) and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains and snowfall during December and January. The mean annual air temperature is 54 to 57 degrees Fahrenheit (12.2 to 13.9 degrees Celsius). The frost-free period is 150 to 180 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Nalaki (AZ), Lomaki (AZ), and Tuweep (AZ), soils. Tuweep soils form in basalt residuum have calcic and argillic horizons, are moderately deep, and have more than 14 percent clay and less than 35 percent gravel fragments in the particle size control section. Nalaki soils form in tephra residuum and are very shallow and shallow to bedrock to duripan, and have less than 27 percent clay in the particle size control section. Lomaki soils form in tephra residuum and are very deep, and have less than 27 percent clay in the particle size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; low runoff; moderate or moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Vegetation includes galleta, broom snakeweed, black grama, and fourwing saltbush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Arizona. Blacktank soils are of moderate extent. This soil is named after the tank near the type location. MLRA 35 Land Resource Unit 35.2.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Coconino County, Arizona; Bighawk Valley Soil Survey Update Project, AZ, 2016

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

The epipedon is neither mollic nor ochric because rock structure exists in surface fragments and within the upper two horizons. 

Cambic horizon - the zone from 2 to 19 inches (5 to 47 cm) (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons) 

Volcanic glass - exceeds 30 percent in mineral class control section

Particle size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches (25 to 100 cm) (Bk horizons)
