BATTLEFIELD SERIES

The Battlefield series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in sandy and gravelly outwash deposits on lake terraces, outwash plains, and beach deposits. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, frigid Typic Endoaquods

TYPICAL PEDON: Battlefield sand, on a north facing, 1 percent slope in a forest. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 A--0 to 2 cm (1 inch); very dark gray (10YR 3/1) sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; many gray (10YR 6/1) uncoated sand grains; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many fine and common medium roots; very strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [0 to 15 cm (6 inches) thick]

 E--2 to 13 cm (1 to 5 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sand; single grain; loose; many fine and common medium roots; 6 percent gravel; very strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. [2.5 to 13 cm (1 to 5 inches) thick]

 Bs1--13 to 25 cm (5 to 10 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) sand; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; many fine and common medium roots; 10 percent strongly cemented ortstein; common faint cracked coatings on sand grains; common medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron; 13 percent gravel; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. [5 to 25 cm (2 to 10 inches) thick]

 Bs2--25 to 46 cm (10 to 18 inches); strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) gravelly sand; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; few fine and common medium roots; common fine distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron; 16 percent gravel; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary. [8 to 43 cm (3 to 17 inches thick)

 BC--46 to 81 cm (18 to 32 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) sand; single grain; loose; few fine roots; many coarse distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) and many coarse distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) masses of oxidized iron; 9 percent gravel; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. [0 to 36 cm (14 inches) thick]

 2C--81 to 152 cm (32 to 60 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly sand; single grain; loose; few fine roots; common fine faint brown (10YR 4/3) masses of oxidized iron; 20 percent gravel and 7 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Cheboygan County, Michigan; about 6 miles southeast of the city of Cheboygan; 900 feet south and 700 feet east of the northwest corner of sec. 29 T. 37 N., R. 1 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Thickness of the solum: 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches)

2C horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 5 or 6
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: very gravelly sand or gravelly sand, or is stratified gravelly sand, gravelly coarse sand, coarse sand, and sand
Rock fragment content: 18 to 45 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles 
Reaction: dominantly slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Au Gres, Kinross, Wainola, and Wormet series. Au Gres, Kinross and Wainola soils have less than 18 percent gravel in the lower part of the series control section. Wormet soils do not have sand textures in the upper part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Battlefield soils are on lake terraces, outwash plains, and beach deposits. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Battlefield soils formed in sandy and gravelly outwash deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 838 mm (28 to 33 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 4.4 to 7.2 degrees C (40 to 45 degrees F). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the East Lake, Nadeau, Roscommon, and Wheatley soils. The somewhat excessively drained East Lake and well drained Nadeau soils are on higher landscape positions. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Roscommon and Wheatley soils are on lower landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Depth to the top of a seasonally high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm (.5 foot to 1.5 feet) between December and May in normal years. Potential surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high. Permeability is rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most is in woodland. Forest vegetation consists mainly of quaking aspen, balsam fir, paper birch and red maple. Some areas are used for pasture and growing hay. The remainder is idle.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 94A,94B, and 96 in the northern Lower Peninsula and eastern Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The series is of small extent.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 13 cm (5 inches) (A and E horizons). 
Albic horizon: from a depth of 2 to 13 cm (1 to 5 inches) (E horizon). 
Spodic horizon: from a depth of 13 to 46 cm (5 to 18 inches) (Bs1 and Bs2 horizons).
