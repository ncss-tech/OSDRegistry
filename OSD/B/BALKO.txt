BALKO SERIES

The Balko series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in calcareous loess of late Pleistocene age to early Holocene age. These nearly level to gently sloping soils occur on plains of the Southern High Plains, Northern Part (MLRA 77A). The slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 13.5 degrees C (56 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 508 mm (20 in). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Pachic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Balko silt loam -- on a 2 percent linear slope in rangeland at an elevation of about 855 m (2805 ft).
