BOBKNOLL SERIES

The Bobknoll series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium from sedimentary rock over residuum derived from sandstone and conglomerate.  Bobknoll soils are on plateaus.  Slopes range from 2 to 10 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 35 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Calciustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bobknoll very fine sandy loam, on a west facing, convex, 4 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 2,271 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The surface is covered by 5 percent sandstone gravel.

(Combined thickness of the Bk horizons is 21 to 59 cm)

    R--89 to 99 cm; indurated sandstone bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Snilloc, Sweatbee and Tanoan (T) series.   These soils are greater than 102 cm deep to bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium derived from sedimentary rock over residuum from sandstone
Landform:  plateaus

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Colskel, Pollow, Stephouse and Wimmer series.  The Colskel and Stephouse soils are shallow and are on bench ridges, rims and risers under Utah juniper and pinyon.  The Pollow soils have argillic horizons and are on concave areas under mixed shrubs and ponderosa pine.  The Wimmer soils are fine-loamy, very deep and are in concave areas intermixed with the Bobknoll soils.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Grazing, watershed, recreation and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, Mormon-tea, fourwing saltbush, buckwheat, winterfat, Indian ricegrass, blue grama, western wheatgrass, needleandthread, muttongrass and a few Utah juniper and pinyon pine.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Utah upland plateaus; LRR D, MLRA 34B; small extent.  About 2,450 hectares (6,000 acres) in Emery County, Utah.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Emery County, Emery soil survey area, Utah, 2011.  The name is derived from Bob Hill Knoll near the type location.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 89 cm.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 25 to 89 cm.  (Bw and Bk horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 7 cm.  (A horizon)
Cambic horizon:  The zone from 7 to 30 cm.  (Bw horizon)
Calcic horizon:  The zone from 30 to 89 cm.  (Bk horizons)
Lithic contact:  The contact with indurated sandstone bedrock at 89 cm.  (R horizon)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
