BRUNEEL SERIES



The Bruneel series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that

formed in recent alluvium from mixed sources.  Bruneel soils are on

floodplains and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  Permeability is

moderate through the subsoil and rapid in the substratum.  The average

annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the average annual air

temperature is about 42 degrees F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Endoaquolls

frigid Typic Haplaquolls.



TYPICAL PEDON:  Bruneel loam - on a 1 percent slope at an elevation of

4,800 feet in pastureland.  When described on October 22, 1971, the

soil was moist throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise

noted.)



    A1--0 to 7 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish

brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak, medium subangular blocky structure;

slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine

roots; common fine tubular pores; slight effervescence (10 percent

calcium carbonate); moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); clear wavy boundary.

(4 to 10 inches thick)



    A2--7 to 14 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark

grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; many fine distinct yellowish brown

(10YR 5/4) dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist mottles; weak medium

subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky

and slightly plastic; common fine roots; many fine tubular pores;

mildly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)



    Bg--14 to 23 inches; light gray (N 6/0) loam, gray (N 5/0) moist;

common fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dark yellowish brown

(10YR 3/4) moist; mottles; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly

sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; mildly alkaline (pH

7.4); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 12 inches thick).



    2Cg1--23 to 27 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly loamy

sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/3) moist; few distinct yellowish

brown (10YR 5/4) dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist mottles;

massive; soft, very friable; few fine roots; few very fine tubular

pores; about 50 percent pebbles; mildly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy

boundary.  (2 to 5 inches thick)



    2Cg2--27 to 61 inches; variagated color; extremely gravelly coarse

sand; single grain; loose; few fine roots; about 65 percent pebbles;

mildly alkaline (pH 7.4).



TYPE LOCATION:  Blaine County, Idaho; about 6 miles south and 1 mile

west of Bellevue; 100 feet west and 1,100 feet south of the northeast

corner of sec. 2, T. 1 S., R. 18 E.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other soils recognized in this family.

Withers soils are similar.  Wither soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in

the upper part of the control section and have water tables at a deeper

depth.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bruneel soils are on flood plains.  Slopes range

from 0 to 3 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,700 to 6,000 feet.  The

soil formed in recent alluvium from mixed sources.  The annual

precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, most of which falls as snow and early

spring rain.  The annual air temperature is about 40 to 44 degrees F.

The frost-free season is 60 to 100 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Adamson, Balaam, Carey

Lake, Hutton, Little Wood, and Marshdale soils.  Adamson soils are well

drained.  Balaam soils are excessively drained.  Carey Lake and Little

Wood soils have argillic horizons.  Hutton soils have more than 35

percent clay in the 10 to 40 in control section and are poorly drained

occurring on floodplains adjacent to the Challis volcanic parent

material.  Marshdale soils are in a fine-loamy family and are on the

same landscape position.  Adamson, Balaam, and Carey Lake soils occur

on fan terraces.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; moderate permeability

through the subsoil and very rapid in the underlying material.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for rangeland, pastureland and limited

cropland.  Vegetation is tufted hairgrass, sedges, rushes, and basin

wildrye.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Bruneel soils are inextensive in southcentral

Idaho.
