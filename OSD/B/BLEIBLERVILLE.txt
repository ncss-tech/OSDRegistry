BLEIBLERVILLE SERIES

The Bleiblerville series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed from weakly consolidated calcareous clays and marls of Tertiary Age.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1088 mm (43 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 20.4 degrees C (69 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, thermic Udic Haplusterts

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brenham, Carbengle, Frelsburg, and Latium series.  Brenham and Carbengle soils: are on nearby similar landscapes, contain large amounts of calcium carbonate, contain less clay, and do not have slickensides.  
Frelsburg and Latium soils: have dry color values of 5.5 or more within 30 cm (12 in) of the surface in 50 percent of each pedon and are on adjacent steeper slopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Permeability is very slow.  Runoff is low on slopes less than 1 percent, medium on 1 to 3 percent slopes, and high on 3 to 5 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for rangeland with small areas being cultivated to corn and grain sorghum.  Most areas have been cultivated in the past.  Native vegetation was mid and tall prairie grasses with a few scattered trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Blackland Prairie of Texas (MLRA 86B).  The series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Washington County, Texas; 1978.

REMARKS:  Classification change from Udic Pellusterts to Udic Haplusterts based on Amendment 16, SOIL TAXONOMY (294). Properties of this soil appear to overlap those of the Houston Black series, but the two soils are on different kinds of landscapes.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon: 0 to 84 cm (0 to 45 in)  (A, and Bss1 horizons)
Cambic horizon: 84 to 203 cm (33 to 80 in)  (Bss2 and Bkss horizons)
Slickensides: 20 to 191 cm (8 to 75 in) (Bss2 and Bkss horizons)
Cracks that remain open 90 to 150 cumulative days in most years.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Soil was described and sampled from a 9.8 m (32 ft) long pit.  National Soil Survey Laboratory:  S77TX477-4 (78P0099-78P0100).  Texas A&M University Data on mineralogy verifies smectitic mineralogy.
