BIJOU SERIES

The Bijou series consists of very deep, well to somewhat excessively drained soils formed in thick noncalcareous coarse to moderately coarse textured materials derived from granite or arkose deposits.  Bijou soils are on terraces, alluvial fans, valley side slopes, and sandy uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 36 centimeters (14 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C. (47 degrees F.)

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bijou loamy sand - grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

  A1--0 to 25 centimeters (0 to 10 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 5 percent fine and very fine angular granitic pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 28 centimeters (3 to 11 inches) thick)

  A2--25 to 38 centimeters (10 to 15 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; primary peds are very hard; 5 percent fine and very fine angular granitic pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 13 centimeters (0 to 5 inches) thick)

  Bt--38 to 71 centimeters (15 to 28 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate very coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; peds are extremely hard; thin patchy clay films on faces of some peds and discontinuous clay films in root channels and pores; clay films bridging sand grains and coating sand grains and rock fragments; 5 percent fine and very fine angular granitic pebbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (15 to 91 centimeters (6 to 36 inches) thick)

  BC--71 to 84 centimeters (28 to 33 inches); light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) sandy loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; weak coarse angular blocky structure; hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; peds are extremely hard; few patchy clay films on faces of peds and coating some sand grains; 5 percent fine and very fine angular granitic pebbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 20 centimeters (3 to 8 inches) thick)

  C--84 to 152 centimeters (33 to 60 inches); light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) loamy sand, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; massive; very hard, loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 10 percent fine and very fine angular granitic pebbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  Morgan County, Colorado; approximately 58 meters (190 feet) west and 53 meters (175 feet) north of the southeast corner of Sec. 25, T. 4 N., R. 59 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Depth to uniformly calcareous material: 102 to 152 centimeters or more (40 to 60 inches)
Depth of the argillic horizon: 30 to 102 centimeters (12 to 40 inches)
ESP: remains constant or increases with increasing depth and ranges from 0 to 14 in the subhorizons of the solum or C horizon.  
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent by volume of the solum and C horizon above 102 centimeters (40 inches) mainly 1/8 to 1/2 inch in diameter.

A horizon:
Hue: 5Y to 7.5YR
Value: 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist
Chroma: 1 to 4
Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline.

Bt horizon:
Hue: 5Y to 7.5YR
Value: 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist
Chroma: 1 to 6
Texture: sandy loam
Clay content: 5 to 18 percent
Silt content: 5 to 35 percent
Sand content: 52 to 75 percent more than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand
Loamy sand or coarser textures: excluded from the above range   
Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline.

C horizon:
Hue: 5Y to 7.5YR
Value: 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 2 to 6
Texture: loamy sand, coarse sand, or coarse sandy loam that grades to coarse textured material at depths of less than 102 centimeters (40 inches)  
Reaction: neutral or slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Betonnie (CO), Tintero (CO), Terro (WY), Terry (CO), and Vonalee (WY) series. 
Betonnie and Tintero soils are not in LRR-G and are drier in May and June. 
Vonalee soils are calcareous above a depth of 102 centimeters (40 inches), and have visible accumulation of secondary carbonate.  
Terro and Terry soils have bedrock above a depth of 102 centimeters (40 inches).  
Terry soils are calcareous in the lower part of the solum and in the C horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: thick noncalcareous, coarse to moderately coarse textured materials derived from granite or arkose deposits 
Landforms: terraces, alluvial fans, valley side slopes, and sandy uplands  
Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  
Elevation: 1311 to 1402 meters (4,300 to 4,600 feet)  
Mean annual precipitation: 33 to 38 centimeters (13 to 15 inches) peak periods of precipitation occurring in the spring and early summer months  
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 13 degrees C. (47 to 55 degrees F.)
Mean summer soil temperature: 20 to 24 degree C. (68 to 75 degrees F.)  
The frost-free period: 120 to 155 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Blakeland and Bresser soils. 
Blakeland soils have a mollic epipedon and lack an argillic horizon.  
Bresser soils have a mollic epipedon and have 18 to 35 percent clay in the Bt horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage: well to somewhat excessively drained
Runoff: low to very low 
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: high to very high

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for grazing land or as dry or irrigated cropland.  
Native vegetation is blue grama, sand sage, yucca, sand reed grass, and needleandthread grass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern and central Colorado in MLRA's 67 and 69.  The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado
