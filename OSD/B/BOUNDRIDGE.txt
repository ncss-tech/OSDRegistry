BOUNDRIDGE SERIES

The Boundridge series consists of shallow to a duripan, well-drained soils formed in alluvium from chert, sandstone and quartzite.  Boundridge soils are on terrace summits, ridge tops and fan terraces. Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degree F.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, shallow Typic Duricryolls

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cokeville (T), Pontuge (T), and Slan (T) series. The Cokeville series has an argillic horizon, is deep, and is fine-loamy.  Cokeville soils are located on terrace sides, hillsides, and mountainsides formed in sandstone and conglomerate.  The Pontuge series is  fine-loamy, moderately deep, has a pachic mollic epipedon and has an argillic horizon. Pontuge soils are located on terrace sides and hillsides on alluvium derived from sandstone and conglomerate. The Slan series has an argillic horizon, is moderately deep and is fine-loamy. Slan soils are located on smoother terrace sideslopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium and rapid runoff; moderate permeability to duripan.

USE AND VEGETATION: Boundridge soils are used primarily for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Important native plant species are mountain big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, letterman needlegrass and mountain snowberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The soils of this series are moderately extensive in southeastern Idaho.
