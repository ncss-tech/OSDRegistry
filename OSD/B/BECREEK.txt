BECREEK SERIES

The Becreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium on stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Calcixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Becreek fine sandy loam, on a 1 percent slope in cropland at an elevation of 1,487 meters. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. When described on August 23, 1989, the soil was dry throughout.)

 Ap--0 to 13 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate thin platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.

 AB--13 to 23 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Ap and AB horizons ranges from 18 to 41 cm)

 Bk1--23 to 36 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; calcium carbonate coats on bottoms of rock fragments; 25 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.

 Bk2--36 to 53 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; calcium carbonate coats on bottoms of rock fragments; 45 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bk horizons ranges from 20 to 48 cm)

 2Bk3--53 to 79 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain, loose; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial voids; calcium carbonate coats on bottoms and bridging between rock fragments; 75 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual boundary. (5 to 33 cm thick)

 2Bk4--79 to 152 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely gravelly sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; single grain, loose; many very fine and fine interstitial voids; calcium carbonate coats on bottoms of rock fragments; 75 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

TYPE LOCATION:  Clark County, Idaho; about 11 kilometers south of Dubois, Idaho; about 61 meters north and 610 meters east of the south west corner, sec. 29, T. 9 N., R. 36 E.; USGS Camas, Idaho topographic quadrangle; latitude 44 degrees, 4 minutes, 22 seconds N. and longitude 112 degrees, 14 minutes, 49 seconds W.; NAD 83.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Deecree, Denay, Eaglecone, Nirac, Pamison Rudeen, Wereld and Xine soils. Deecree soils average 30 to 40 percent calcium carbonate in the particle-size control section. Denay soils lack the sandy-skeletal material in the lower part of the particle-size control section. Eaglecone soils have angular rock fragments. Nirac, Rudeen and Xine soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Pamison soils have weak discontinuous silica and carbonate cementation. Wereld soils are deep to bedrock.
