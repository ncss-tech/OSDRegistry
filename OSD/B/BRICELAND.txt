BRICELAND SERIES

The Briceland series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from mudstone. Briceland soils are on mountains and slopes range from 15 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2160 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Briceland soils are on linear to slightly concave or convex positions on mountain slopes and ridges. Slopes range from 15 to 30 percent. Elevations range from 155 to 460 meters. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from mudstone. Landscapes dominated by Briceland soils have hummocky relief and slips. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers with a marine layer influenceand cool, wetwinters. Mean annual precipitation is 1525 to 3050 millimeters. Mean January temperature is about 7 degrees C, mean July temperature is about 22 degrees C, and the mean annual temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C.  Frost free period is about 240 to 280 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Tankridge soil. Tankridge soils have moderately cemented mudstone bedrock with cracks spaced less than 10 centimeters apart above 50 centimeters. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained, very high runoff, moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for livestock grazing, watershed, and wildlife habitat. Vegetation is annual and perennial grasses and forbs including wild oats, bristly dogstail rass, wildrye, and medusahead.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coastal Redwood Belt; MLRA 4B. The soils are not extensive. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Humboldt County Survey Area, Southern Part, California, 2010. The name is from the town of Briceland.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 32 centimeters (A1 and A2 horizons).
2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 32 to 200 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, and BCt horizons).
3. Particle-size control section - the zone from 32 to 82 centimeters averages 34 percent clay and 60 percent silt, by weight, and 3 percent gravel by volume.  The clay percentage does not drop by as much as 8.8 percent from the maximum clay content. (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)
