BRUNCAN SERIES

The Bruncan series consists of shallow to duripan, well drained soils with moderately slow permeability that formed in mixed silty alluvium and loess from basalt and volcanic ash.  Bruncan soils are on tablelands, calderas, structural benches, plains and buttes.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the average annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Xeric Argidurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bruncan gravelly loam -- on a slope of 2 percent, in native rangeland at 1,465 meter elevation.  The surface has about 3 percent stone cover.  (When described on July 1, 1980, the soil was dry throughout.  Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Bkqm--36 to 51 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) to white (10YR 8/2) continuous, indurated siliceous laminae 1 mm thick over white (10YR 8/1) continuous, strongly cemented extremely cobbly loamy sand, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; massive; extremely hard, brittle; 25 percent gravel, 50 percent cobbles; violently effervescent; abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 30 cm thick)

    2R--51 inches; basalt.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Acana, Argalt, Ayres, Bartome, Chuckridge, Chuska, Colthorp, Dewar, Grassval, Handpah, Packwood, Pipeline, Roseworth, Thoms and Wellington series.  Acana, Ayres, Bartome, Chuckridge, Chuska, Dewar, Handpah, Grassval, Pipeline, Roseworth, Thoms and Wellington soils lack bedrock above 100 cm.  Argalt soils are less than 25 cm deep to bedrock.  Colthorp soils have less than 25 percent rock fragments in the substratum.  Packwood soils have hue of 7.5YR on 5YR in the B2t horizon and average 30 to 35 percent clay in the texture control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bruncan soils are nearly level to rolling on tablelands, calderas, structural benches, plains and buttes at elevations of 825 to 1,795 meters.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in mixed silty alluvium and loess from basalt and volcanic ash.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and warm and dry in the summer.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 200 to 360 mm.  Average annual temperature ranges from 7.2 to 11.1 degrees C.  Frost-free period is 80 to 145 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arbidge, Buncelvoir, Hardtrigger, Laped, Minveno, Snowmore and Troughs series.  Arbidge and Snowmore soils are 50 to 100 cm deep to a duripan.  Hardtrigger soils lack an indurated duripan.  Laped soils have less organic matter in the surface horizon and are drier.  Minveno soils lack an argillic horizon.  Troughs soils have greater than 35 percent coarse fragments in the argillic horizon.  Arbidge, Buncelvoir, Hardtrigger and Snowmore soils are on lower sideslopes and toeslopes.  Laped, Minveno and Troughs soils are on similar landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow to rapid runoff; moderately slow hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Bruncan soils are used mainly for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The dominant natural vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Thurber needlegrass with low sagebrush or black sagebrush in some areas.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Idaho and Southeastern Oregon.  Bruncan soils are extensive. MLRA 25.

REMARKS:  This revision (6/95) changes the classification from Xerollic Durargids to Xeric Argidurids according to the 1994 edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy.  The remainder of the OSD has not been updated since 6/93.

Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon - zone 0 to 8 inches (A horizon).
Argillic horizon - zone 8 to 28 cm (Bt, Btk1, and Btk2 horizons).
Calcic horizon - zone 13 to 28 cm (Btk1, Btk2, and Bkq horizons).

Duripan - zone 36 to 51 cm (Bkqm horizon).
Lithic contact- The boundary at 51 cm (R boundary).
Particle-size control section - The zone  from the soil surface to 36 cm. (the A, Bt, Btk1, Btk2 and the Bkq horizons).

The superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.
