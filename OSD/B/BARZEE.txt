BARZEE SERIES 

The Barzee series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in organic materials.  These soils are in closed depressions on moraines, depressions or flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Euic, frigid Typic Haplohemists 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Barzee mucky peat, on a west-facing moraine under shrubs and sedges (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 4 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) broken face and rubbed mucky peat (fibric material); about 90 percent fiber and raw herbaceous plant material, about 70 percent rubbed; massive; nonsticky and nonplastic; 80 percent Lycopodium mosses and 20 percent herbaceous; many very fine and fine roots; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick) 

    Oe1--4 to 25 inches; black (10YR 2/1) broken face and rubbed mucky peat (hemic material); about 60 percent fiber, about 25 percent rubbed; massive; nonsticky and nonplastic; 90 percent Lycopodium mosses and 10 percent herbaceous; many very fine and fine roots; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (21 to 36 inches thick) 

    Oe2--25 to 55 inches; stratified (1/2 to 3 inches) black (10YR 2/1) broken face mucky peat and very dark brown (10YR 2/2) broken face peat (stratified hemic (80 percent) and fibric (20 percent) material); black (10YR 2/1) rubbed and pressed, about 40 percent fiber, about 20 percent rubbed; massive; nonsticky and nonplastic; 80 percent Lycopodium mosses and 20 percent herbaceous; many very fine roots; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary. (14 to 30 inches thick) 

    Oe3--55 to 70 inches; black (10YR 2/1) broken face and rubbed mucky peat (hemic material); about 40 percent fiber, about 20 percent rubbed; massive; nonsticky and nonplastic; 90 percent herbaceous and 10 percent Lycopodium mosses; many very fine roots; moderately acid (pH 6.0).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Barzee soils are used for wildlife habitat, livestock grazing, and hayland.  Potential native vegetation is mainly mosses, beaked sedge, rushes, bulrushes, mannagrass, cattail, reed canarygrass, Bebb's willow, and water birch. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Barzee soils are of small extent in the valleys of northwestern Montana. MLRA 44A.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Flathead County, MT, 1997. 

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretation Record:  MT1617.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a histic epipedon from the surface to 25 inches (Oi, Oe1 horizons); mostly hemic organic materials; a water table at or near the surface most of the year; a control section from the surface to 52 inches (Oi, Oe1, Oe2 horizons).  Barzee soils have a frigid soil temperature regime and aquic conditions.
