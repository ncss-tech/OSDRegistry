BURKHARDT SERIES

The Burkhardt series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in 25 to 50 centimeters of loamy alluvium and in the underlying sandy outwash.  These soils are on outwash plains, outwash terraces, valley trains and on treads and risers on stream terraces in river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 840 millimeters. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludolls

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Washington County, Minnesota, 1941. 

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 25 centimeters (Ap horizon);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 25 to 43 centimeters (Bt horizon);
udic moisture regime. 

Lab data indicates that Burkhardt soils have base saturation of 50 percent or more (by NH4OAc) in all horizons between the mineral soil surface and a depth of 180 cm. However, it is suspected that the very low CEC in the sandy outwash results in drastic changes in base saturation with the addition of a few bases from fertilization. These soils may be Inceptisols in their natural state.
