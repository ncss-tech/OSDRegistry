BRAD SERIES

The Brad series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils on strongly sloping to very steep mountainsides.  They formed in residuum from sandstone.  Slope ranges from 15 to 80 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C, and the mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Lithic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Brad very cobbly loamy sand--rangeland.  (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Oi--0 to 5 cm; organic litter, leaves, twigs, etc.

    A1--5 to 13 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/3) very cobbly loamy sand, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; single grain; loose; many fine and common medium roots; 50 to 90 percent angular gravel, cobbles and stones; neutral (pH 6.9); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 25 cm thick)

    A2--13 to 31 cm; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) very cobbly loamy sand dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; single grain; loose; many fine and common medium roots; 50 to 90 percent gravel, cobbles and stones; neutral (pH 6.7); abrupt wavy boundary.  (8 to 25 cm thick)

    R--31 cm; sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION:  Wasatch County, Utah; about 15 km east from center of Heber on Lake Creek Road; about 450 meters west and 425 meters north of southeast corner of sec., 4, T. 4 S., R. 6 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Mean annual soil temperature--7 degrees C
Mean summer soil temperature--17 degrees C
The soil is usually moist but is dry for more than 60 consecutive days in all parts of the moisture control section in more than 7 out of 10 years.
Thickness of mollic epipedon--25 to 40 cm 
Thickness of solum--25 to 50 cm

Particle-size control section:
Coarse fragments--35 to 80 percent
Texture--very cobbly loamy sand, very cobbly loamy fine sand or extremely stony loamy sand

A horizon
Hue--7.5YR or 5YR
Value--3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma--2 or 3
Reaction--pH 6.1 to 7.3

AC or C horizons separate the A horizon and R layer in some pedons.  

C horizon (if present) is similar to the A horizon
Value--5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma--3 or 4

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  Similar soils are Agassiz and Little Pole series.  Agassiz and Little Pole soils have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform--mountain slopes
Elevation--1675 to 2450 meters
Slopes--15 to 80 percent
Parent material--residuum derived from sandstone
Climate--moist subhumid
Mean annual air temperature--6 to 7 degrees C
Mean summer air temperature--16 to 17 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation--460 to 640 mm, falling mostly as snow

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; medium runoff; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used in spring and fall for grazing by livestock and in winter for grazing by big game.  The present vegetation is Gambel oak, big sagebrush, birchleaf mountain mahogany, serviceberry, snowberry, bitterbrush, Indian ricegrass, and juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Brad soils are not extensive and are found in the northcentral mountains of Utah; MLRA 47
