BAILEYCREEK SERIES

The Baileycreek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over colluvium and residuum derived from basalt and andesite.  Baileycreek soils are on mountains and plateaus.  Slopes are 5 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Goshawk (T), McDanielake, Rendovy (T), Satus, and Weste series.

Goshawk and Weste soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  McDanielake, Rendovy, and Satus soils are very deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Baileycreek soils are on mountains and plateaus.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in volcanic ash over colluvium and residuum derived from basalt and andesite.  Slopes are 5 to 50 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,600 to 5,400 feet.  The climate is subhumid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 40 inches with 60 to 100 inches of snow.  The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Weste soils and the Almanor, Redriver, and Whorled soils.  Almanor and Whorled soils are medial-skeletal and do not have argillic horizons.  Redriver soils do not have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium or high surface runoff; moderate or moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Baileycreek soils are used for timber production, recreation, urban development, and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is a forest canopy of Jeffrey pine, white fir, and sugar pine with an understory of whitethorn ceanothus and greenleaf manzanita.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern California.  These soils are not extensive with about 6,700 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 22B.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Plumas County (Susanville Area Soil Survey), California, 2000.

REMARKS:  The revision of February 2004 updated the taxonomic class from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, active, frigid Andic Haploxeralfs based on laboratory data from the UC Davis Soil Morphology Laboratory.  Field determined sodium fluoride pH along with laboratory determined 1500 kPa water/clay ratio indicates the isotic mineralogy class is appropriate.  Oxalate aluminum plus one-half oxalate extractable iron and volcanic glass content in the A and BA horizons is estimated based on laboratory data from similar soils in the survey area.


Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 9 inches (A and BA horizons).

Andic soil properties - The zone from the soil surface to 9 inches (A and BA horizons).

Argillic horizon - The zone from 9 to 30 inches (2Bt1 and 2Bt2 horizons).

Paralithic contact - The boundary at 30 inches to underlying soft, weathered bedrock (2Cr layer).

Particle-size control section - The zone from 9 to 29 inches (2Bt1 horizon and part of the 2Bt2 horizon).

ADDITIONAL DATA:  A pedon of Baileycreek sampled near the series type location has reference data by the UC Davis Soil Morphology Laboratory.  Selected data such as particle-size analysis, 1500 kPa water content, base saturation, and organic carbon content are available.
