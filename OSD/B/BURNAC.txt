BURNAC SERIES

The Burnac series consists of deep and very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed from basalt, sandstone, and shale alluvium.  Burnac soils are on basalt flows and benches with slope of 1 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Typic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Burnac stony loam - forested.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

   Oi--2 inches to 0; decomposed and decomposing forest litter.  (1 to 3 inches thick)

   A--0 to 6 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) stony loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; 20 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 7 inches thick)

   E--6 to 12 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) stony loam, dark brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky and moderate very fine granular structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine, medium and coarse roots; 25 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

   Bt1--12 to 17 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; strong fine and medium angular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, sticky, very plastic; many medium and coarse roots; many moderately thick clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 6 inches thick)

   Bt2--17 to 26 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure that parts to strong medium angular blocky structure; very hard, extremely firm, sticky, very plastic; continuous thick clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary.  (7 to 10 inches thick)

   Bt3--26 to 31 inches; reddish brown (2.5YR 5/4) clay loam, reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; very hard, extremely firm, slightly sticky, very plastic; many thick clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent pebbles and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 6 inches thick)

   C--31 to 53 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) very gravelly sandy clay, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; massive; very hard, very firm, slightly sticky, plastic; 45 percent pebbles, cobbles, and stones; mildly alkaline (pH 7.5); abrupt wavy boundary.  (17 to 23 inches thick)

   2R--53 inches; basalt rock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Colfax County, New Mexico; about 6 miles east-northeast of Black Lake, New Mexico; 2,025 feet south and 1,850 feet west of NE corner sec. 8, T.24N., R.17E.;
105 degrees, 09 minutes, 20 seconds w. longitude;  36 degrees, 19 minutes, 42 seconds n. latitude.

Argillic horizon:  15 to 22 inches thick

A horizon:  Hue - 7.5YR or 10YR.
Value:  3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Acel(MT), Bario (NM),  Dandrea (AZ), Echolake(CO)(T), Iles(CO), Loghill(CO)(T), Siesta (AZ), Silesca(CO)(T), and Spud(NM) soils.  Acel soils have cracks wider than 1 centimeter at a depth of 20 inches.  Bario and Iles soils have calcic horizons.  Echolake, Dandrea and Silesca soils have lithic or paralithic contacts at 20 to 40 inches.  Loghill soils do not have E horizons. Siesta soils have cinders in the lower part of the Bt.  Spud soils have argillic horizons with the base more than 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Burnac soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep, convex basalt flows where elevations range from 7,000 to 11,000 feet.  The soils formed in stony, fine textured alluvium weathered from basalt, sandstone and shale.  The climate is continental with average temperature estimated at 41 degrees F. to 45 degrees F. and average summer temperatures estimated at 47 degrees F.  The annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 23 inches of which about 60 percent falls during the frost-free period.  Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent.  Frost free period is 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Barela and Saladon soils and several soils to be classified in the future.  Barela and Saladon soils have mollic epipedons.  Also, Saladon soils have an aquic moisture regime.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; very slow permeability. (Permeability is slow in Colorado)

USE AND VEGETATION:  Commercial woodland, wildlife, and recreation.  Douglas-fir, white fir, limber pine, aspen, Englemann, blue spruce, and mountain grasses are the principal plants.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern New Mexico and southern Colorado. The series is moderately extensive.
