BANDAG SERIES

The Bandag series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately or moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from intermediate igneous and sedimentary rocks.  Bandag soils are on fan skirts, toeslopes of alluvial fans and alluvial flats and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F. (10 degrees C), and the average annual precipitation is about 10 inches (256 mm).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, calcareous, mesic Xeric Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bandag loam; rangeland (Colors are for air-dry soils unless otherwise stated.)

  A1--0 to 2 inches(0 to 5 cm); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium platy structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common medium, fine and very fine roots; few medium, common fine and very fine pores; strongly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.

  A2--2 to 5 inches (5 to 13 cm); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium platy structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; soft, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common medium, fine and very fine roots; few fine and common very fine pores; strongly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.

  A3--5 to 10 inches (13 to 33 cm); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; few medium, common fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine pores; strongly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.

  C1--10 to 23 inches (33 to 59 cm); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; few medium, common fine and very fine pores; strongly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.

  C2--23 to 34 inches (59 to 87 cm); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine pores; strongly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.

  C3--34 to 60 inches (87 to 154 cm); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) moist; single grain; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and very fine roots; common very fine pores; strongly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

TYPE LOCATION: Iron County, Utah; about 6.5 miles north-northeast of Lund, about 2,200 feet south and 1,000 feet east of the northwest corner of sec. 19, T. 31 S., R. 13 W.; Latimer USGS quad; lat. 38 degrees 05 minutes 39 seconds N. and Long. 113 degrees 21 minutes 34 seconds W., NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: 
Soil moisture - Usually dry; moist in winter and spring and for brief periods in late summer due to convection storms. (Aridic bordering on xeric soil moisture regime.)

Mean annual soil temperature: 47 to 52 degrees F (8 to 11 degrees C).  

Effervescence: Slightly to violently effervescent throughout, but are leached of carbonates to a depth of 4 inches (10 cm) in some pedons.  
Reaction: Slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline throughout.  
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 15 to 40 percent.

Particle size control section (weighted average): 
 Clay content: 18 to 27 percent 
 Rock content: 0 to 20 percent gravel

A horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 5 or 6 dry and 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4, dry or moist  
Where dry value is 5 and moist value is 3, either the A horizon is less than 6 inches (15 cm) thick or the chroma is 4  
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent gravel

C horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 5 to 7 dry and 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 2 to 6, dry or moist
Texture: loam, silt loam, or sandy loam; subhorizons of clay loam, silty clay loam or sandy clay loam are in some pedons.
Rock fragments: 0 to 20 percent gravel above a depth of 40 inches but may contain up to 45 percent below this depth.
Electrical conductivity (mmhos/cm): 0 to 16

Some pedons have a buried A and Bk horizons. The Bk horizon has hue of l0YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 to 8 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam or clay loam.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bandag soils are on fan skirts, toeslopes of alluvial fans, and alluvial flats at elevations of 4,700 to 6,100 feet (1433 to 1860 meters). Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from igneous and sedimentary rocks. The average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches (205 to 307 mm), and the mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F (7 to 11 degrees C). The freeze-free period is 100 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Annabella, Braffits and Sevy soils. Annabella soils are loamy-skeletal and occur on fan terraces upslope from the Bandag soils. Braffits soils occur on alluvial fans on elevations below the Bandag soils. The Sevy soils have an argillic horizon and occur on convex slopes of fan terraces where Bandag soils occur in drainageways.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low runoff, moderate or moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for rangeland and wildlife habitat. Some areas are used for irrigated cropland and nonirrigated pastureland. The native vegetation is dominantly Wyoming big sagebrush, yellowbrush, winterfat, Indian ricegrass, squirreltail, needleandthread, and globemallow. Irrigated crops include alfalfa and small grains. In Utah this series is correlated with semi-desert range sites.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwestern Utah. These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 28A.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Iron County, Utah, Iron-Washington Soil Survey, 1997.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizon and features recognized in the pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 10 inches (25 cm). (Ap Horizons)

Particle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches (25 to 100 cm).
Xeric feature: Moisture regime is aridic bordering on xeric.

The cation exchange activity class is based on KSSL User Pedon ID 90UT027002 (Lab Pedon number 90P1033).
