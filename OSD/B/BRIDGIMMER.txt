BRIDGIMMER SERIES

The Bridgimmer series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed colluvium or slope alluvium over residuum derived from sandstone.  These soils are on escarpments, hills and pediments.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 1 degree C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed Ustic Haplocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Bridgimmer sandy loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 20 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; many very fine and fine, and common medium and coarse roots; many fine interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 25 cm thick) 

    Bw--20 to 41 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; many very fine and fine, and common medium, and few coarse roots; many fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 30 cm thick) 

    C--41 to 58 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) parachannery loamy sand, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium and coarse roots; many fine tubular pores; 20 percent parachanners; neutral (pH 6.7); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 50 centimeters thick)  

    Cr--58 cm; moderately cemented sandstone bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform - escarpments, hills, pediments
Elevation - 2,195 to 2470 meters
Slope - 4 to 30 percent
Parent Material - colluvium or slope alluvium over residuum derived from sandstone
Climate - long, cold winters; cool, moist springs; short cool summers
Mean annual precipitation - 380 to 485 mm with peak periods of precipitation occurring during the spring
Mean annual air temperature - 0.5 to 3.0 degrees C

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Bridgimmer soils are primarily used for rangeland.  The potential native vegetation is mountain big sagebrush, needle and thread, Indian ricegrass, and other miscellaneous forbs and grasses. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Bridgimmer soils are of small extent in southwestern Wyoming. MLRA - 43B.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES PROPOSED: Sublette County, Wyoming 2011.  The series name is coined from a local area landmark.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 20 cm (A horizon)
Cambic horizon - from 20 to 41 cm (Bw horizon)
Paralithic contact - at 58 cm (Cr horizon) 
Particle-size control section - from 25 to 58 cm (part of Bw, C horizon)

Bridgimmer soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
