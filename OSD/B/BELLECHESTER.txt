BELLECHESTER SERIES

The Bellechester series consists of deep and very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in 100 to 180 centimeters of sandy colluvium and residuum from sandstone overlying soft sandstone bedrock. These soils are on concave, south-facing to west-facing, lower back slopes on valley sides in maturely dissected terrain. Slope ranges from 12 to 90 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 850 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Goodhue County, Minnesota, 1972. 

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 107 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 41 centimeters (A1 and A2 horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 41 to 107 centimeters (BA, Bw, and BC horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Entic subgroup based on presence of carbonates throughout the cambic horizon.

This soil is usually 100 to 150 centimeters to bedrock but may range to 180 centimeters. The representative value (RV) in NASIS will be a value between 100 and 150 centimeters and interpretations for this series will be based on less than 150 centimeters to soft bedrock.
