BAUER SERIES

The Bauer series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in 25 to 50 centimeters of loamy or silty sediments over residuum from brown and gray acid shale.  These soils are on convex side slopes and escarpment-like areas that parallel major streams.  Slope ranges from 5 to 40 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 835 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Bauer silt loam, on a northeast-facing slope of 15 percent, in a pasture.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 A1--0 to 15 centimeters; black (10YR 2/1) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) dry; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; friable; neutral; clear smooth boundary.

 A2--15 to 23 centimeters; very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) dry; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; friable; black (10YR 2/1) coats on faces of peds; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the A horizon is 20 to 38 centimeters.)

 BA--23 to 30 centimeters; olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) silty clay loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; common roots; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) coats on faces of peds; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 13 centimeters thick)

 2Bg1--30 to 43 centimeters; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) and light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) silty clay; moderate medium angular blocky structure; very firm; common roots; very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) and dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) coats on faces of some peds; common fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) redoximorphic concentrations; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.

 2Bg2--43 to 66 centimeters; olive (5Y 4/3) clay; weak coarse angular blocky structure; very firm; few roots; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) coats on faces of peds; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the 2Bg horizon is 13 to 50 centimeters.)

 2Cr--66 to 152 centimeters; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6), gray (5Y 5/1), and light olive gray (5Y 6/2) clay shale; neutral.

TYPE LOCATION: Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) 108-Illinois and Iowa Deep Loess and Drift, Marion County, Iowa subset; about 6 miles west of Knoxville; located about 100 feet north and 1,550 feet east of the southwest corner of section 1, T. 75 N., R. 21 W.; USGS Knoxville SW topographic quadrangle; lat. 41 degrees 19 minutes 15 seconds N. and long. 93 degrees 13 minutes 39 seconds W., NAD 83.

COMPETING SERIES:  No other series are in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--25 to 50 centimeters of loamy or silty sediments over residuum from brown and gray acid shale
Landform--convex side slopes and escarpment-like areas that parallel major streams
Slope--5 to 40 percent
Elevation--210 to 340 meters above sea level
Mean annual air temperature--8 to 13 degrees C
Man annual precipitation--750 to 920 millimeters
Frost-free period--155 to 175 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Gosport, Lamoni, and Sharpsburg soils.
Gosport--are on landscape positions similar to the Bauer soils and do not have a mollic epipedon
Lamoni and Sharpsburg--are at higher landscape positions on side slopes and do not have shale bedrock within the series control section

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--moderately well drained--a frequently saturated zone occurs at a depth of 1.2 meters during in the wettest periods of normal years
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--0.01 to 0.10 micrometers per second (low)
Surface runoff potential--very high

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are pastured.  The more gently sloping areas are cultivated.  The principal crops are corn, soybeans, small grains, and legume hay.  The native vegetation is short and tall prairie grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Physiographic Division--Interior Plains
Physiographic Province--Central Lowland
Physiographic section--Dissected till plains
MLRAs--Illinois and Iowa Deep Loess and Drift (108) and Iowa and Missouri Heavy Till Plain (109)
LRR M; southern Iowa and northern Missouri
Extent--moderately extensive

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Livingston County, Missouri, 1948.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 91 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 23 centimeters (A1 and A2 horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 23 to 66 centimeters (BA, 2Bg1, and 2Bg2 horizons);
paralithic contact--the contact with shale bedrock at a depth of 66 centimeters (2Cr horizon);
udic moisture regime.

The geological origin of the mantle is uncertain.  The gray colors in the B and C horizons are inherited from the shale and were not considered in the classification of this soil.

The extreme variation in the shale parent material raises the question as to family placement.  Drainage class is difficult to assess because of the color inherited from the shale.

X-ray diffraction data indicates that kaolinite and illite are the dominant minerals and so the mineralogy class is considered mixed. 2/10/2011-TYPE LOCATION error was corrected.
