GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chelina, Cirquecreek, Drashner, Forthofjuly, and Greylingcreek soils.
Chelina soils are well drained, have a loess mantle, have a cambic horizon, and occur on lacustrine terraces.
Cirquecreek soils are well drained, have a cambic horizon, have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in its particle size control section, and occurs on saddles and mountain slopes.
Drashner soils are somewhat poorly drained, have histic epipedons, and occur on mountains and hillslopes.
Fourthofjuly soils are well drained, has a folistic epipedon, and occurs on mountain valleys and stream terraces.
Greylingcreek soils are excessively drained, have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle size control section, and occur in mountain valleys and moraines.
