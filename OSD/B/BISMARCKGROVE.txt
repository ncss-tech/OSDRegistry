BISMARCKGROVE SERIES 

The Bismarckgrove series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils on flood plain steps. They formed in silty alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 36 inches. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Fluventic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Bismarckgrove silt loam - on a 1 percent north-facing slope in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 7 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.

 A--7 to 20 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; moderate fine subangular structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky, plastic; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizons is 15 to 23 inches)

 Bw--20 to 29 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky, plastic; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. (5 to 12 inches)

 C1--29 to 58 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, very pale brown (10YR 8/2) dry; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; thin strata of sandier soil throughout; neutral; clear smooth boundary.

 2C2--58 to 80 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy fine sand, very pale brown (10YR 8/3) dry; single grain; loose, loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; neutral

TYPE LOCATION: Jefferson County, Kansas; about .3 miles south of Perry, Kansas; 2400 feet east and 1900 feet south of the northwest corner, sec. 26, T. 11 S., R. 18 E.
