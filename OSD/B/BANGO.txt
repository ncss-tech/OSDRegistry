BANGO SERIES

The Bango series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium over lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Bango soils are on basin-floor remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Haplic Natrargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bango sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    3C3--41 to 76 cm; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) very fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary. (25 to 46 cm thick)

    3Cy--76 to 160 cm; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) silt loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few fine tubular pores; few fine prominent yellowish red (5YR 5/6) and dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist relict masses of iron accumulation; common fine and medium irregularly shaped gypsum concretions; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  Lyon County, Nevada; about 7 miles east of Fernley, 30 feet east of a power line, and 500 feet north of the paved Fernley Farm Road; approximately 1,960 feet east and 560 feet north of the southwest corner of section 19, T. 20 N., R. 26 E.; USGS Hazen 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 34 minutes 41 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 6 minutes 38 seconds W: WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.578611 latitude, -119.110833 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually moist for short periods in winter and early spring, dry May through October; typic aridic moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 14 degrees C.
Depth to base of natric horizon: 15 to 50 cm.
Depth to lacustrine material: 25 to 66 cm.
Other features: A layer of dendritic tufa occurs sporadically but is discontinuous.  When present it is within 25 cm of the base of the natric horizon.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  18 to 30 percent.

A horizon
Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y.
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.

Btn horizon
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR.
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4, dry or moist.
Texture:  Loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.
Clay content:  20 to 30 percent.
Structure:  Medium or coarse prismatic parting to weak or moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky.
Reaction:  Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.
Consistence: Slightly hard or hard, friable or very friable.
Sodicity (SAR): 5 to 30.  Generally less than 13 in most of the Btn horizon but increases steadily with depth to greater than 13 within 40 cm of the upper boundary of the horizon.

C horizons
Texture:  Stratified fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, silt loam, loam, and silty clay.
Clay content:  18 to 30 percent.
Reaction:  Slightly alkaline through strongly alkaline.
Redoximorphic features: Relict masses of iron accumulation usually occur at depths below 61 cm.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Gamgee series.  Gamgee soils have the base of the natric horizon at 51 to 76 cm from the soil surface and have a upper subdivision of the natric horizon with 35 to 45 percent clay.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bango soils are on basin-floor remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium over lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 1,200 to 1,300 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Biddleman, Hawsley, and Isolde soils.  Biddleman soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Hawsley and Isolde soils are sandy.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Bango soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Bailey's greasewood, shadscale, and bud sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 27.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lyon County (Fallon-Fernley Area), Nevada. 1971.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 10 cm (A horizon).
Natric horizon - The zone from 10 to 20 cm (Btn horizon).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 100 cm (Btn, 2C1, 3C2, and 3C3 horizons and part of the 3Cy horizon).

Dendritic tufa resembles the caps of mushrooms in shape. This type of tufa was first defined by Russell in "Geological History of Lake Lahontan"; Dendritic tufa was precipitated from hot springs and deposited on the shoreline terraces of this ancestral lake.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  A pedon sampled as Bango has full characterization data by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as pedon ID 77NV019007 (pedon # 78P0020).  This pedon is a taxadjunct to Bango because it has a gypsic horizon within 85 cm of the soil surface.
