BRADEN SERIES

 The Braden series consists of somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils on stream terraces.  They formed in alluvial sandy and loamy sediments. Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 56 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 73 degrees F. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, siliceous, subactive, hyperthermic Aquic Arenic Hapludults

TYPICAL PEDON:  Braden fine sand--forest. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

(Total thickness of the Bt horizon ranges from 10 to 18 inches)

      BC--40 to 44 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) loamy fine sand; moderate medium granular structure; very friable; few to common sand grains coated and bridged with clay; many fine faint strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulations and many medium distinct light gray (10YR 7/2) areas of iron depletions; extremely acid; clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick)

      Cg1--44 to 50 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) fine sand; single grained;  loose; few fine distinct brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) masses of iron accumulation; extremely acid; gradual wavy boundary.  

      Cg2--50 to 55 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sand; single grained; loose; few medium faint light gray (10YR 7/2) areas of iron depletions; extremely acid; clear wavy boundary.  

      Cg3--55 to 70 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) sand; single grained; loose; many coarse distinct light gray (10YR 7/2) areas of iron depletions; very strongly acid.  (Combined thickness of the Cg horizons ranges from 6 to 36 inches)

TYPE LOCATION:  Manatee County, Florida; about 2 miles southwest of Lorraine and 0.75 mile south of Fla. Hwy, 70; NW1/4, SW1/4, Sec. 21, T. 35 S., R. 19 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Reaction of the A horizon is very strongly acid or strongly acid and ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in the Bt and C horizons.

The A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value 2 and chroma 1, or value 3 or 4, and chroma 1 to 3.  Thickness is less than 10 inches where value is 3 or less and chroma 2 or less.  Texture is sand or fine sand.

The E horizon has hue 10YR, value 4 to 7, and chroma 2 to 6.  Redox features in shades of yellow, brown, and gray or splotches of uncoated sand grains with chroma 2 or less range from none to common.  Texture is sand or fine sand.

The BE horizon, where present, has hue 7.5YR or 10YR, value 5 to 7, and chroma 4 to 8.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.

The Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value 5 to 7, and chroma 3 to 8.  Redox features in shades of yellow, brown, and gray range from few to many. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  In some pedons there are a few streaks or lenses of coarser textured material in the horizon.  In some pedons the lower Bt horizon has hue 10YR to 2.5Y, value 4 to 7, and chroma 2 or less; or it is neutral with value of value 4 to 7. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.

The BC horizon, where present, hue, value, and chroma are similar to those of the Bt horizon.  Texture ranges from fine sandy loam to loamy sand.

The Cg horizon has hue 10YR to 2.5Y, value 4 to 7, and chroma 2 or less; or it is neutral with value of value 4 to 7. Texture is sand or fine sand.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other soils in the same family. The Kendrick and Lochloosa series are in closely similar families. Both these soils have less than 20 percent decrease in clay content within depths of 60 inches and are on upland. In addition, Kendrick soils are well drained.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Braden soils are on high stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  They formed in alluvial sandy and loamy sediments.  Near the type location, the average annual precipitation ranges from 54 to 58 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 71 to  75 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Boca, Cassia, EauGallie, Felda, Myakka, Oldsmar, Pomello, Pomona, Wabasso, and Wauchula series.  All of these soils except Boca and Felda soils have spodic horizons.  In addition, EauGallie, Myakka, Oldsmar, Pomona, Wabasso, and Wauchula soils are poorly drained and Pomello soils are moderately well drained.  Boca and Felda soils are poorly drained.  In addition, Felda soils have high base saturation and Boca soils have limestone between depths of 20 to 40 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; permeability is rapid in the A horizon and moderate in the Bt horizon. 
USE AND VEGETATION:  Braden soils are used for improved pasture, rangeland, and in some places citrus.  Native vegetation consists of open forest of slash pine, live oak, cabbage palm, sawpalmetto, creeping bluestem, panicum, and pineland threeawn.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Peninsular Florida.  The series is of small known extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Manatee County, Florida; 1950.  (See Remarks)

REMARKS:  This series was correlated in the Manatee County soil survey and presumed established as a result of that correlation. The series is currently in an inactive status.  This series has been reactivated as a result of field examination of soils mapped as this series and other closely similar soils.  

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:

Ochric epipedon - 0 to 28 inches (A, E1, E2, E3, E4, and BE horizons)

Argillic horizon - 28 to 44 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and BC horizons)

A water table is between depths of 30 and 40 inches for 1 to 3 months in most years.  Flooding is rare for brief periods.
