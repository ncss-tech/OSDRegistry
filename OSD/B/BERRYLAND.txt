Depth to Bedrock: Greater than 183 cm (72 inches)
Depth to Seasonal High Water Table: + 15 cm (6 inches) to 25 cm (10 inches), October to June. Unless drained, the water table is at depths of 30 to 61 cm (12 to 24 inches) in summer months. 
Depth to the Spodic Horizon: 25 to 41 cm (10 to 16 inches)
Rock Fragments: less than 15 percent, by volume throughout the profile, mostly quartzose pebbles, commonly less than 5 percent. The Bh horizon contains firm nodules that range from non-cemented to strongly cemented and are hard to very hard when dry.
Soil Reaction: Extremely acid to strongly acid, throughout the profile, unless limed
Other Features: Iron content is low in most pedons and specimens from the Bh horizon do not normally turn red when heated unless the soils are limed. 

Range of Individual Horizons:
O horizon (if it occurs):
Color--hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 1 to 3
Type of organic soil material--highly decomposed to slightly decomposed plant material 

A, Ag, or Ap horizon:
Color--hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 2 or 3
Texture--coarse sand, sand, fine sand,  loamy fine sand or loamy sand, with mucky modifiers 

Eg horizon:
Color--hue of 7.5YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 6, chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 5 or 6
Texture--coarse sand, sand, fine sand, or loamy sand 

Bh horizon:
Color--hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, chroma of 1 to 4

Bg horizon:
Color--hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 1 to 3, or is neutral with value of 4 to 6

Redoximorphic Features--iron depletions in shades of olive, gray, or white and iron accumulations in shades of red, brown, yellow, or olive. Some pedons have one or more Bh horizons below the Bg horizon. This feature is not series criteria. These Bh horizons have the same range in color, structure, and rupture resistance as previously described. 

Cg horizon:

Ab horizon (if it occurs):
Color--hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of  2 to 4, chroma of 1 to 4
Texture--sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam

COMPETING SERIES: None 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: Coastal Plain, upland or lowland
Landform: Broad, nearly level areas adjacent to swamps and in bottoms of closed depressions at levels just above the tidal mark. Further inland, Berryland soils are found at elevations of 15 meters (50 feet) or more. In these areas,   the water table is perched by finer textured layers.
Elevation: 1.5 to 46 meters (5 to 150 feet) above mean sea level
Parent Material: Sandy eolian deposits and/or fluviomarine sediments
Slope: 0 to 2 percent
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 11 to 14 degrees C. (52 to 58 degrees F.)
Mean Annual Precipitation: 1016 to 1270 mm (40 to 50 inches)
Frost Free Period: 180 to 220 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Atsion soils--poorly drained soils that do not have an umbric epipedon, on slightly higher landforms
Lakehurst soils--moderately well drained soils that do not have an umbric epipedon, on slightly higher landforms
Lakewood soils--Excessively drained soils that do not have an umbric epipedon, on higher landforms 
Mullica soils--do not have a spodic horizon, on similar landforms

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage Class (Agricultural): Very poorly drained
Internal Free Water Occurrence:  Very shallow, 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 inches) and common (present 3 to 6 months) 
Flooding Frequency and Duration: None
Ponding Frequency and Duration: None to frequent and none to long 
Index Surface Runoff: Negligible 
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: High 
Permeability (obsolete): Moderately rapid
Shrink-swell Potential: Low

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major uses--Mostly in woodland. Some of the soil has been cleared for growing high-bush blueberries and cranberries. Drained areas have been used for growing vegetables, corn, soybeans and small grain 

Where wooded--predominantly pitch pine, widely spaced Atlantic white cedar, red maple, and black gum. The dense understory is commonly high-bush blueberry, sweet pepperbush, bay magnolia, leather leaf, gallberry, and greenbriar. In Maryland, loblolly pine, pond pine, red maple, sweetgum, black gum, willow oak, swamp chestnut oak, and American holly are important forest trees. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Distribution--Coastal Plain of New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, Massachusetts, and possibly Long Island, New York 
Extent--Moderate 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Salem County, New Jersey, 1966 
Remarks: The series was reclassified as Typic Alaquods with the 1996 revision to the Keys to Soil Taxonomy. 

Previous revisions: 11/2002-JAK.  Added coordinates-March 2015-DTA.

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Umbric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 25 cm  (Ap horizon)
Albic horizon--the zone from 25 to 30 cm (Eg horizon)
Spodic horizon--the zone from 30 to 51 cm (Bh horizon)
Aquic conditions--the zone from the soil surface (or 15 cm ) to a depth of 200 cm is saturated from October to June (endosaturation).
