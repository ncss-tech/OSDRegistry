COMPETING SERIES: These are the Chiniak, Fingers, Kocacho, Pasagshak, Puffin, and Tangoe (AK) series.
Chiniak soils have marine deposits in the substratum, are moderately well drained, and occur on island beaches, beach plains, and berms.
Fingers soils have an oxygenated water table below a depth of 25 cm (10 in) and occur on outwash plains.
Kocacho soils are saturated at depths between of 25 to 50 cm (10 to 20 in) in May through July and occur on depressions on stream terraces.
Pasagshak soils have a lithologic discontinuity between 20 and 41 cm (8 to 16 in) and occur on islands.
Puffin soils have free carbonates below 70 cm (28 in) and do not have organic horizons.
Tangoe soils have stratified coarse-loamy textures at depths between 5 to 25 cm (2 to 10 in) and a lithologic discontinuity.
