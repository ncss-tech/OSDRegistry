BRUNO SERIES

The Bruno series consists of very deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils. These soils formed in sandy alluvium on flood plains of the Mississippi River and its tributaries, MLRA 131. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, thermic Typic Udifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Bruno sandy loam--cultivated. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

 Ap--0 to 8 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam; weak fine granular structure; very friable; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick) 

 C1--8 to 20 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loamy sand; single grained; loose; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. (6 to 16 inches thick) 

 C2--20 to 24 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam; weak fine granular structure; very friable; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 16 inches thick) 

 C3--24 to 38 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loamy sand; single grained; loose; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick) 

 C4--38 to 42 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam; weak fine granular structure; very friable; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 10 inches thick) 

 C5--42 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sand; single grained; loose; neutral. 

TYPE LOCATION: Lake County, Tennessee; near the New Madrid Bend of the Mississippi River; from Tiptonville, 9 miles north on Tennessee Highway 22; west 1 mile on Highway 22; west 1/2 mile on county road; 300 yards south of the county road. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is greater than 60 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 5 feet. 

The A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Some pedons have an A horizon that is less than 6 inches with value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is dominantly fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand or loamy sand, and rarely loam or silt loam. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline.

The C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4 or hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 or 6. Some pedons have iron accumulations and depletions in shades of brown or gray in the lower part. Texture is sand, loamy fine sand or loamy sand but contains thin strata of loamy very fine sand or finer textures. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: The Kiomatia series is in the same family. Kiomatia soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder and formed in Red River or Arkansas River alluvium. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bruno soils are on flood plains of the Mississippi River and its tributaries, MLRA 131. They are commonly on natural stream levees and where natural levees have been breached by flood waters. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Bruno soils formed in sandy alluvium and thin strata of finer texture. Near the type location, the average annual precipitation is 48 inches, and the average annual temperature is 60 degrees F. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Beulah, Commerce, Crevasse and Robinsonville series. Beulah and Robinsonville are coarse-loamy particle-size class. Crevasse soils lack strata of loamy fine sand or finer in the 10- to 40-inch control section. Commerce soils are farther from the streams, fine-silty, and somewhat poorly drained. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Excessively drained; negligible runoff; rapid permeability. These soils are rarely to frequently flooded. The water table is below 40 inches most of the year. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cleared and used for growing pasture and grain. Natural vegetation is cottonwood, willow, oaks, sycamore, hackberry, and pines. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee. This series is of moderate extent.
