BLANCHE SERIES

The Blanche series consists of well drained, moderately deep, moderately rapid permeable soils formed in loamy calcareous residuum on uplands. These soils are moderately deep over weakly cemented limestone and very fine-grained sandstone of the Ogallala formation. Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 18 inches, and mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Blanche very fine sandy loam - on a nearly level slope in a cultivated field. When described, the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  Ap--0 to 6 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine and fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; common very fine and few fine roots; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.

  A--6 to 11 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine and fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; common very fine and few fine roots; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizons is 6 to 14 inches.)

  Bw1--11 to 19 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky; hard, very friable; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.

  Bw2--19 to 26 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak fine and medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable; few fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common worm channels about 2 to 4 mm in diameter; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bw horizons is 11 to 18 inches.)

  Bk--26 to 34 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; common fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; many mycelial-like threads of calcium carbonate; common chips and fragments of limestone; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick)

  Cr--34 to 80 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) weakly cemented limestone of the Ogallala formation; light gray (10YR 7/2) moist; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline.
