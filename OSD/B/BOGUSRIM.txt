BOGUSRIM SERIES

The Bogusrim series consists of moderately deep over duripan, well drained soils that formed in mixed volcanic ash and loess over residuum weathered from volcanic rock. Bogusrim soils are on lava plateaus. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Abruptic Xeric Argidurids

TYPICAL PEDON: Bogusrim cobbly ashy silt loam, rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is partly covered by 5 percent stones and 2 percent cobbles.

    Bk--52 to 82 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, very firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0). (4 to 60 cm thick)

    Bkqm1--82 to 111 cm; cemented material; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; massive; rigid, nonsticky, nonplastic; strongly cemented by secondary silica and calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6). (2 to 55 cm thick)

    Bkqm2--111 to 130 cm; cemented material; massive; rigid, very strongly cemented by secondary silica and calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6). (19 to 38 cm thick)

    R--130 cm; indurated volcanic rock

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Catchell, Chilcott, Lookout, Lovejoy, Novacan, Pigtail, Reno, and Suncold soils. Catchell soils have very strongly cemented or indurated duripans and have E horizons; Chilcott soils are greater than 152 cm to bedrock; Lookout soils have indurated duripans; Lovejoy soils have an indurated duripan do not have bedrock within 152 cm of the soil surface. Novacan, Pigtail, and Reno soils are greater than 152 cm to bedrock. Suncold soils do not have Bk horizons above the duripan.   

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bogusrim soils are on lava plateaus. These soils are formed in mixed volcanic ash and loess over residuum weathered from volcanic rock. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Elevations are 1,280 to 1,370 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 280 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Suncold and Wisher soils. Wisher soils are very deep and have mollic epipedons.
