BALAAM SERIES



The Balaam series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained

soils that formed in recent alluvium from mixed sources.  Balaam soils

are on stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 4 percent.  Permeability

is moderately rapid in the upper part and very rapid in the underlying

material.  The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and

average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Ultic Haploxerolls



TYPICAL PEDON:  Balaam gravelly sandy loam on a 1 percent slope at an

elevation of 5,000 feet in pastureland.  When described on October 19,

1971, the soil was moist to 14 inches and dry in the underlying

material.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)



    A1--0 to 3 inches, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly sandy loam,

very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular

structure; slightly hard, firm; many very fine and fine roots; many

fine interstitial pores; about 20 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH

6.2); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 10 inches thick)



    A2--3 to 14 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly sandy loam,

dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky

structure; slightly hard, friable, many fine roots; many fine

interstitial pores; about 30 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4);

gradual smooth boundary.  (5 to 11 inches thick)



    2Bw--14 to 21 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very gravelly

coarse sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive;

slightly hard, friable; common fine roots; about 50 percent pebbles;

neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 14 inches thick)



    3Bk--21 to 61 inches; extremely gravelly coarse sand; single grain;

loose; few fine roots; about 50 percent pebbles and 10 percent cobbles;

slightly effervescent (calcium carbonate about 5 percent); lime and

silica occur as coatings less than 1mm thick on the underside of coarse

fragments; mildly alkaline (pH 7.8).



TYPE LOCATION:  Blaine County, Idaho about 3 miles south of Bellevue;

2,450 feet west and 1,120 feet south of the northeast corner of section

13, T. 1N R. 18 E.

Base Saturation by sum of cations (some part of upper 30 inches) - 50

to 75 percent

Value - 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist

Chroma, moist or dry - 2 or 3

Clay content - 0 to 10 percent

Rock fragments - 60 to 85 percent

Greater than 3 inches - 10 to 50 percent

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other soils recognized in this family.

Soils in a similar family are the Olancha series.  Olancha soils are

moderately deep to a paralithic contact.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Balaam soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes range

from 0 to 4 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,700 to 6,100 feet.  The

soil formed in recent alluvium from mixed sources.  The annual

precipitation is 14 to 18 inches, most of which falls as snow and early

spring rain.  The annual air temperature is about 40 degrees to 45

degrees F.  The frost free season is 60 to 90 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Adamson, Bruneel, Carey

Lake, Hutton, and Little Wood soils.  Carey Lake and Little Wood soils

have argillic horizons.  Bruneel and Hutton have aquic moisture

regimes.  Adamson soils have mollic epidepons greater than 20 inches

thick and occur on the same position in the landscape.  Bruneel soils

are on recent flood plains.  Carey Lake and Little Wood soils occur on

older alluvial fans and fan terraces.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; slow runoff;

moderately rapid permeability in the upper part and very rapid in the

underlying material.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for rangeland, pastureland and limited

cropland.  Vegetation is basin big sagebrush, mountain big sagebrush,

Idaho fescue, sandberg bluegrass, and needlegrass.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Balaam soils are inextensive in south central

Idaho.
