BEAVERELL SERIES

The Beaverell series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or glacial outwash that is 10 to 20 inches deep over very gravelly loamy sand or very gravelly sand.  These soils are on stream terraces, outwash terraces, kames, eskers and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcidic Argiustolls

COMPETING SERIES:

There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - stream terraces; outwash terraces; kames; eskers; alluvial fans.
Elevation - 2,400 to 6,500 feet.
Slope - 0 to 35 percent.
Parent material - alluvium or glacial outwash that is 10 to 20 inches deep over very gravelly loamy sand or very gravelly sand.
Climate - long cold winters; moist springs; hot, dry summers.
Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 14 inches.
Mean annual air temperature - 37 to 45 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 70 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Attewan and Wabek soils. Attewan soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal. Wabek soils are sandy-skeletal and do not have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability above the sandy-skeletal horizon and rapid in the sandy-skeletal horizon. Moderately wet phase has a seasonal high water table at 4 to 6 feet.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Beaverell soils are used for irrigated small grain, irrigated hay and pasture, and as rangeland.  Potential native vegetation is mainly western wheatgrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, green needlegrass, needleandthread, forbs, and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Beaverell soils are of moderate extent in Montana.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Stillwater County, Montana, 1975.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT0178, MT1030.  

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  

Mollic epipedon - from the soil surface to 11 inches (A, Bt1, Bt2 horizons)
Argillic horizon - from 8 to 11 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizons)
Horizon of carbonate accumulation (2Bk1, 2Bk2 horizons)
Calcic horizon - from 11 to 17 inches (2Bk1) and likely from 11 to 60 inches (2Bk1 and 2Bk2)
Sandy-skeletal material - from 17 to 60 inches (2Bk1, 2Bk2 horizons)
Particle-size control section - from 3 to 40 inches (Bt1, Bt2, 2Bk1, 2Bk2 horizons).  

Beaverell soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.

The 6/2012 revision reflects a reclassification from Aridic Argiustolls to Calcidic Argiustolls because the 2Bk1 horizon meets the criteria for a calcic horizon.  A check of NASIS data shows that component data as populated for Bk horizons also consistently meets criteria for a calcic horizon.  Classifications of Beaverell components in all survey areas should be reviewed as part of a future update project.  The 2Bk2 horizon at the type location should be investigated to determine if it is part of the calcic horizon.
