BEAVOE SERIES

The Beavoe series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rock.  These soils are on fan remnants and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 1 degree C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Oxyaquic Argicryolls

(40 to 90 cm thick)

    BCk2--110 to 200 cm; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) extremely gravelly loamy sand, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist; single grain; soft, loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 5 percent masses of oxidized iron redox concentrations in matrix; 5 percent distinct carbonate coats on bottom surfaces of rock fragments; 50 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; slightly effervescent (2 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).
