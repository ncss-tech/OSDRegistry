BITCREEK SERIES

The Bitcreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils. These soils formed in residuum weathered from shale and/or sandstone. Bitcreek soils are on hillslopes. Slope is 2 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm (12 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C (64 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bitcreek soils are on backslopes of hillslopes at elevations of 356 to 1,583 meters (1,168 to 5,194 feet). These soils formed in material weathered from shale and/or sandstone fragments. Slope is 2 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 356 mm (8 to 14 in) and the mean annual air temperature is 14 to 18 degrees C (57 to 64 degrees F). The frost-free season is 150 to 300 days.

Balhud soils are on shoulders of hillslopes and have a paralithic contact between 25 and 50 cm. Dibble soils are on hills and fan remnants and have a fine particle size control section and smectitic mineralogy..

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; high or very high runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for grazing, recreation, wildlife habitat, and homesite development. The vegetation is mainly red brome, red stem filaree, California poppy and other annual forbs and grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Hills in the southern most part of the San Joaquin Valley, MLRA 15, with small extents in MLRA 18 and 19. These soils are of limited extent.
