BROE SERIES

The Broe series consists very deep well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived primarily from tuff, ash, basaltic and andesitic rocks. Broe soils are on fan remnants and alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Durinodic Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Broe gravelly fine sand--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 5 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly fine sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; single grained; loose; few medium and coarse roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 20 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 15 cm thick)

    Bw1--5 to 13 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; many very fine vesicular pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 13 cm thick)

    Bw2--13 to 38 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; many fine white (10YR 8/1) carbonate filaments; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt wavy boundary.  (15 to 38 cm thick)

    Bqk--38 to 61 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; many hard and firm durinodes; many fine and medium white (10YR 8/1) carbonate seams; violently effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2); clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 30 cm thick)

    2Bqk--61 to 84 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; many 0.6 to 2.5 cm very firm durinodes with white (10YR 8/1) carbonate coats; strongly and violently effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (20 to 60 cm thick)

    3C--84 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine interstitial pores; noncalcareous except for few white (10YR 8/1) carbonate segregations; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  Nye County, Nevada; about 2.5 miles southeast of the San Antonio Ranch; about 750 feet south and 400 feet east of the northwest corner of section 5, T. 6 N., R. 42 E.; USGS San Antonio Ranch 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees, 24 minutes, 43 seconds N and longitude 117 degrees, 17 minutes, 42 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.4119444 latitude, -117.2950000 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Soil moisture: Usually moist in some part for short periods during winter and early spring months and intermittently moist in some part for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July to September due to convection storms; typic aridic moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 14 degrees C.
Depth to sandy material: 33 to 60 cm.
Depth to durinodes: 33 to 76 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content; Averages 2 to 8 percent.
Rock fragments: Average 0 to 10 percent.

A horizon
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist. 
Chroma: 2 or 3.  
Effervescence: Noneffervescent through slightly effervescent.

Bw and Bqk horizons
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist. 
Chroma: 2 through 4.  
Texture: Fine sandy loam or sandy loam.
Rock fragments: 0 to 25 percent, dominantly gravel.
Reaction: Slightly alkaline through strongly alkaline.
Effervescence: Noneffervescent through violently effervescent.

2Bqk and 3C horizons
Texture: Loamy fine sand, fine sand or sand.
Effervescence: Slightly effervescent through violently effervescent.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Broe soils are on fan piedmonts' and alluvial fans at elevations of 1,680 to 1,830 meters.  Slope gradients are 0 to 8 percent.  The soils formed in sandy alluvium derived primarily of tuff, ash, basaltic and andesitic rocks.  The climate is warm, arid with a mean annual precipitation of 125 to 150 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C.  The average frost free season is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Jolan, Orphant, and Stumble soils.  Jolan soils have duripans.  Orphant soils have loamy argillic horizons over strongly silica cemented duripans.  Stumble soils lack cambic horizons and durinodes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; very slow runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing and production of wildlife food and cover.  The vegetation is principally galleta, shadscale, Bailey greasewood, bud sagebrush, rabbitbrush and winterfat.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Broe soils are in central Nevada and are inextensive. MLRA 29.

REMARKS:  Broe soils were classified as Alluvial soils.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (A, Bw1 and part of Bw2 horizons).
Cambic horizon - The zone from 5 cm to 38 cm (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).
