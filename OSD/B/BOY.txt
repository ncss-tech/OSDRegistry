BOY SERIES

The Boy series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils. These nearly level to gently sloping soils formed in unconsolidated sandy and loamy materials derived from alluvium. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1321 mm (52 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Grossarenic Plinthic Paleudalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Boy loamy fine sand--forest. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   A--0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 in); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loamy fine sand, light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; single grained; loose; many fine to coarse roots; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. (13 to 25 cm thick [5 to 10 in thick])

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family. Closely similar series are the Bienville, Bonifay, Darco, Depcor, Gunter, Kenney, Landman, Padina, Pickton and Rentzel series.

Bienville soils have Bt horizons that consist of lamella or that are loamy fine sand.
Bonifay, Darco, Gunter and Rentzel soils have base saturation less than 35 percent; in addition, Rentzel soils have sandy epipedons of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 in) thick.
Depcor soils have sandy epipedons 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 in) thick. Kenney soils contain less than 5 percent plinthite. 
Landman soils are deeper than 152 cm (60 in) to the horizon containing more than 5 percent plinthite. 
Padina soils do not plinthite and are dry for more than 90 cumulative days in most years.
Pickton soils lack horizons that contain 5 percent or more plinthite.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: sandy and loamy materials derived from alluvium
Landscape: Coastal Plane
Landform: interfluves
Slope: 0 to 8 percent
Mean annual air temperature range: 19.5 to 20.6 degrees C (degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation range: 1219 to 1473 mm (48 to 58 in)
Precipitation Pattern: Rainfall is fairly uniform throughout the year with slight peaks in the spring and fall months.
Frost-free period: 240 to 300 days	
Elevation: 8 to 46 m (26 to 151 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Depcor series and the Segno, Splendora, Sorter, and Waller series.
Depcor soils are on slightly lower side slopes. 
Segno soils are on similar positions and lack thick sandy A horizons. 
Splendora, Sorter, and Waller soils are on lower wetter positions and do not sandy surface layers.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  moderately well drained. Runoff is high due to saturation in the E horizon. In wet seasons, these soils are saturated in and just above the Bt horizon for periods from 2 to 4 months.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are in forest.  Some cleared areas are used for corn, truck crops, and pasture.  Native vegetation includes loblolly, shortleaf, and longleaf pines, red oak, white oak, hickory, blackgum, and sweetgum.  Understory includes thick stands about 3 to 4.6 m (10 to 15 ft) high of such plants as yaupon, sweet bay, blackjack oak, wax myrtle, sumac, wild grape, and American beautyberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Coastal Plains of Texas. Moderately extensive.
