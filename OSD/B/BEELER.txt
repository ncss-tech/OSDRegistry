ADDITIONAL DATA: These soils were formerly mapped as Drummond, Richfield saline, and Ulysses saline.
Some pedons may have up to 45 percent clay in the particle size control section. The typical pedon is an example.
Some pedons may have mollic epipedons greater than 50 centimeters thick. 
Characterization data is available for this pedon (User Pedon ID S08KS055002) (NSSL lab pedon # 08N0346).
