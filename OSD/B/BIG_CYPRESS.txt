Runoff: negligible to very low.
Depth to seasonal high water table: 0 to 30 centimeters (0 to 12 inches) of the surface for about 8 months during most years, and within 30 to 100 centimeters (12 to 40 inches) most of the rest of the year.
Surface Water: can range from 15 to 122 centimeters (6 to 48 inches) during the raining season (June to November). During the months of December and January surface water can range from 15 to 91 centimeters (6 to 36 inches).  During the dry season February to May surface water is removed however in some micro low or during longer periods of rain, surface water can range from 0 to 76 centimeters (0 to 30 inches).

USE AND VEGETATION:  
Major uses: water quality and wildlife habitat.  
Dominant vegetation: These include but are not limited to Jamaica swamp sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense), maidencane (Panicum hemitomon), Muhlenberg maidencane (Amphicarpum muelenbergianum), pickerelweed (Pontederia cordata), bulltongue arrowhead (Sagittaria lancifolia), bent alligator-flag (Thalia geniculate), pond cypress (Taxodium ascendens), bald cypress (T. distichem), swamp bay (Persea palustris), pond apple (Annona glabra), and red maple (Acer rubrum). Vines (Similax), ferns (Blechnum, Woodwardia), and arboreal epiphytes (Tillandsia) are abundant. Aquatic emergent vegetation (Nymphaea, Utricularia, Lemna) may be present during periods of high water.
