COMPETING SERIES: These are the Geikie (AK), Lupine (AK), Maclaren (AK), and Sawmillcreek soils.
Geikie soils have a lithologic discontinuity between 35 and 105 cm (14 and 41 in), are strongly alkaline in the 2C material, and occur in outwash plains at elevations of 850m to 1850m (2790 to 6070 ft).
Lupine soils lack coarse fragments in their A and Bw horizons and have a lower pH in the Oi and A horizons.
Maklaren soils are extremely cobbly at depth and have clearly stratified parent material
Sawmillcreek soils are extremely gravely and have free carbonates in the C horizons

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Elevation: 400 to 1000 meters (1310 to 3280 feet)
Parent material: eolian sands over sandy and gravelly alluvium
Landform: terraces
Slopes: 0 to 6 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 400 to 800 mm (16 to 31 in)
Mean annual air temperature: -4 to -2 degrees C. (25 to 28 degrees F)
Frost free period: 36 to 71 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ironcreek, Shand, and Slimecreek soils.
Ironcreek soils lack a cambic horizon and occur in river valleys and flood plains.
Shand soils are very poorly drained, has a histic epipedon, and occur on flood plains.
Slimecreek soils are somewhat poorly drained, aquic conditions, and occur on hillslopes and drainageways.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class: well drained
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: Very high in the O horizon, high in the A and B horizons, and very high in the C horizon.
