BEARHILL SERIES

The Bearhill series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium derived from granitic rocks. The Bearhill soils are on mountain slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1070 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Bearhill soils are on linear to concave footslopes and backslopes of mountain slopes. Slopes range from 15 to 60 percent. These soils formed in colluvium derived from granite and granodiorite. Elevation is 1560 to 2465 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 915 to 1155 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 7 to 12 degrees C. The frost-free season is 105 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Edencreek and Tharpslog soils. The Edencreek soils are on convex shoulders and backslopes of mountain slopes and have a paralithic contact between 50 and 100 cm. The Tharpslog soils are on broadly concave backslopes of mountain slopes and do not have an argillic horizon (subsurface clay accumulation).

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderately high to high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Vegetation is white fir, incense cedar, ponderosa pine, and sugar pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. These soils are of limited extent.
