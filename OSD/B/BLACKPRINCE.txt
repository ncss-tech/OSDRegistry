BLACKPRINCE SERIES

The Blackprince series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on mountains, foothills and canyon sides. They formed in material weathered from gneiss and granitic bedrock with minor amounts of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. Permeability is moderately rapid. Slope ranges from 15 to 75 percent. The average annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 34 inches. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Vitrandic Haploxerepts

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Analulu, Ardenvoir, Ardtoo, Blinn, Brevco, Coxit, Daxty, Easte, Highhorn, Huntrock, Jimbluff, Jumpe, Kamela, Lekrem, Lemoncreek, Longort, Minaloosa, Noil, Ontrail, Radercreek, Redpeak, Santop, Seeburg, Thout, Threecabin and Warfield series. Analulu, Blinn Brevco, Daxty, Huntrock, Kamela, Lemoncreek, Redpeak, Santop and Thout soils are all moderately deep to a lithic contact. Ardenvoir, Ardtoo, Easte, and Noil soils are deep to a paralithic contact. Coxit, Jimbluff, Jumpe, Lekrem, Minaloosa, Ontrail, and Seeburg soils are very deep. Highhorn, Radercreek, Threecabin,and Warfield soils are deep to a lithic contact.  Longort soils are moderately deep to densic material. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Blackprince soils are on south, east and west-facing foothills and canyon sides. Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent. These soils formed in material weathered from gneiss or granitic bedrock with minor amounts of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. Elevations range from 2,000 to 4,150 feet. The average annual air temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F, and average annual precipitation of 25 to 38 inches. The average frost-free period is from 90 to 120 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Jacot, Kruse, and Lotuspoint soils. Jacot soils are on dissected foothills on north aspects, have a thick volcanic ash mantle, and are more than 60 inches deep. Kruse soils are on west or east aspects of dissected foothills and have fine-loamy argillic horizons. Lotuspoint soils are on ridges and south aspects, have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches and are mesic. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; rapid to very rapid runoff; moderately rapid permeability in the solum and rapid permeability in the substratum. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing, recreation, wildlife habitat and watershed. A few areas are used for homesites. Potential natural vegetation is mainly grand fir, Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, and western larch, with an understory of Columbia brome, pinereedgrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, northern bedstraw, mallow ninebark, creambush oceanspray, low Oregon grape, common snowberry, white spirea, rose, Oregon fairybells, and starry false-Solomons-seal. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Idaho and northeastern Washington; MLRA 43A. This soil is of moderate extent.

Particle-size control section - the zone from 11 to 29 inches (part of the BA, and the Bt and C horizons) 
Vitrandic feature - the zone from 1 to 12 inches (A and BA horizons) having estimated properties of 5 to 20 percent volcanic glass, 0.4 to 1.0 percent acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus 1/2 iron, moist bulk density of 1.0 to 1.2 g/cc, and 15-bar moisture of 5 to 10 percent. 

Classification revised 11/01 from Dystric Xerochrepts to Vitrandic Dystroxerepts based on revisions to Soil Taxonomy. Classification revised 9/2009 from Loamy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Vitrandic Dystroxerepts to Loamy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Vitrandic Haploxerepts based on a review of lab data in similar soils.
