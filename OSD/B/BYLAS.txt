BYLAS SERIES

The Bylas series consists of very shallow and shallow well drained soils that formed in alluvium and residuum from silicate-rich lacustrine limestone of Pliocene and Pleistocene age. Bylas soils are on dissected relict lakebeds and have slopes of 0 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic, shallow Typic Haplodurids 

TYPICAL PEDON: Bylas very gravelly loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     A--0 to 0.5 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong thin and medium platy structure; soft, loose, nonsticky, and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many very fine and fine pores; 40 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; violent effervescent; 30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; strongly alkaline, pH 8.6; clear wavy boundary. (.5 to 2 inches thick) 

     Bk--0.5 to 6 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very flaggy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; soft, loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and medium and few coarse roots; common very fine pores; 15 percent gravel, 40 percent calcrete flagstones; violent effervescent, 32 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; strongly alkaline, pH 8.6; abrupt wavy boundary. (6 to 13 inches thick)

    Bkqm--6 to 8 inches; cemented material, duripan.

    R--8 inches; lacustrine limestone bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION: Graham County, Arizona; located at a latitude of 33 degrees, 12 minutes, 48.7 seconds north, and a longitude of 110 degrees, 11 minutes, 26.7 seconds west; NAD 83; Topographic quadrangle:  Calva, Arizona, about 1,950 feet north and 300 feet west of the southeast corner of section 33, T. 2 S., R 21 E.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cline (AZ), Crosgrain (NV), Gotchell (AZ), Greyeagle (CA), Longjim (NV), Marsite (CA), Nonamelake (I)(CA), and Tumarion (AZ) series. Gotchell, Crosgrain, Greyeagle and Longjim soils do not have bedrock at depths less than 20 inches. Tumarion and Marsite soils are moist for less than 20 cumulative days during July-September. Cline soils do not have secondary carbonate accumulations or a strongly alkaline reactivity class, and are over basalt. Nonamelake soils are inactive.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bylas soils are on dissected relict lakebeds of Pliocene and Pleistocene age. Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent. These soils formed in alluvium and residuum from lacustrine limestone and sandstone which were influenced by silicate-rich deposits from nearby volcanoes. Elevations range from 2,500 to 3,800 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September, and gentle rains during December and January. May and June are the driest months.  The mean annual air temperature is 60 to 67 degrees F. The frost-free period is about 190 to 250 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Frye and Stagecoach soils. Frye soils have an argillic horizon. Stagecoach soils are very deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Vegetation includes creosotebush, range ratany, ocotillo, cholla, velvet mesquite, ephedra, Arizona cliff-rose, and canotia.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Arizona. This series is of small extent in MLRA 41. The name is from the nearby community of Bylas.
