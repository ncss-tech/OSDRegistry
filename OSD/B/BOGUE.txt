BOGUE SERIES

The Bogue series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in residuum of weathered acid fissile shale.  These gently sloping to steep soils are on uplands.  Slopes range from 3 to 30 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 54 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 22 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Very-fine, smectitic, mesic Leptic Haplusterts

TYPICAL PEDON: Bogue clay - on a 6 percent southwest-facing slope in native grass range.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  A--0 to 6 inches; gray (5Y 5/1) clay, dark gray (5Y 4/1) moist; weak very thick platy structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; upper 1/2 to 1 inch has strong fine granular structure; very hard, very firm; many fine grass roots; few fragments of calcite; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

  BA--6 to 10 inches; gray (5Y 5/1) clay, dark gray (5Y 4/1) moist; few fine distinct very dark gray (5Y 3/1) moist redoximorphic concretion massess on vertical faces of peds; weak coarse blocky structure; extremely hard, extremely firm; common fine grass roots; few fine fragments of calcite or chalk; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 5 inches thick)

   Bw--10 to 17 inches; gray (5Y 5/1) clay, dark gray (5Y 4/1) and very dark gray (2.5Y 3/1) moist in equal parts in fine indefinite pattern; few fine distinct redoximorphic iron concretions of dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse blocky structure; extremely hard, extremely firm; common fine grass roots; few slickenside, faces intersect and inclined at 20 to 30 degrees from horizontal; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 13 inches thick)

  C1--17 to 23 inches; gray (5Y 5/1) clay, dark gray (5Y 4/1) and black (5Y 2/1) moist in equal parts in medium indefinite pattern; moderate thin platy structure; extremely hard, extremely firm; few fine roots; common shale fragments of yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist and few horizontal and oblique strata 5 to 10 mm thick of yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; very strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick)

  C2--23 to 32 inches; dark gray (5Y 4/1) weathered clay shale with common horizontal strata 1 to 2 cm thick of yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) and black (5Y 2/1) moist; very strongly acid.  (0 to 10 inches thick)

  Cr--32 to 57 inches; clay shale with same colors as horizon above.

COMPETING SERIES:
Currently there are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent Material: residuum of weathered acid fissile shale 
Landform: erosional shale uplands 
Slope: 3 to 30 percent
Mean annual temperature: 50 to 57 degrees F 
Mean annual precipitation: from 18 to 24 inches 
Thornthwaite Annual P-E index: 36 to 42

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Armo, Corinth, New Cambria, Solomon, and Timken soils.
Armo, Corinth, and Timken soils are on nearby uplands.
Armo soils are fine-loamy.
Corinth soils have higher chromas and have formed in residuum of weathered calcareous chalky shale.
New Cambria and Solomon soils are in nearby narrow drainageways or on nearby terraces along major streams.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage: moderately well drained
Runoff: rapid
Permeability: very slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: Bogue soils are used primarily for native range.  The principal species are big bluestem, little bluestem, sideoats grama, and lead plant.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North-central Kansas.  Series is of moderate extent.
