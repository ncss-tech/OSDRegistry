BEAUBIEN SERIES

The Beaubien series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy eolian sand deposits of mostly Holocene age. These nearly level to moderately sloping soils occur on sandsheets leeward of large drainages and river valleys within the Canadian Plateaus LRU of MLRA 70A. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual soil temperature is 11.6 degrees C (53 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 420 mm (16 in).

The Arnor soils formed over residuum of Precambrian bedrock.
Arwite, Deekay, Elwop, Oldwolf, Rauzi, and Rockybutte soils are colder (6.7-10 oC MAAT) with frost free periods of 130 days or fewer.
Augustine soils formed in alluvium from rhyolitic tuff and lava. They can have a calcic horizon at depth.
Bigbow and Dalhart soils are lower in elevation (750-1430m elev.), therefore warmer (12-14 oC, MAAT), but also receive more annual precipitation (381-584mm MAP). 
Bosonoak soils have colors that are 2.5YR or redder and receive the bulk of growing season precipitation during a period beginning after July. 
Carri soils are moderately deep to granitic bedrock.
Celacy, Celavar, Evpark, Gateson, and Ribera soils are moderately deep to sedimentary bedrock.
Dermala and Iwela soils are formed in gravelly and very gravelly alluvium and colluvium. 
Flugle soils are drier (330-381mm MAP) and colder (8.3-10 oC) with up to 15 percent rock fragments.
Fort Collins and Stoneham soils are drier (330-430mm MAP) and colder (7-12 oC MAAT) with bulk precipitation period beginning earlier in the growing season (April). 
Lykorly soils formed in alluvium and have their annual precipitation split between summer and winter months.

Wagonhound soils formed in alluvium and colluvium with up to 15 percent rock fragments and are in a colder (8-11oC MAAT) and drier (300-380mm MAP) climate.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
These soils are located on plateau interfluve landscapes on a variety of landforms that have been exposed to sand sheet deposits. These landforms may include treads, structural benches, ridges, hills, and terrace risers. Precipitation occurs mostly in summer months with the bulk occurring during a period beginning in May and lasting through September. 

Slope: 0 to 3 percent
Soil moisture: An ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic. 
Mean annual soil temperature: 9.4 to 14.4 degrees C (49 to 58 degrees F)
Mean annual air temperature: 8.3 to 12.8 degrees C (47 to 55 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 381 to 457 mm (15 to 18 in) 
Frost-free period: 130 to 175 days
Elevation: 1524 to 2133 m (5000 to 7000 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Carnero, Gallinas, Philmont and Seelez soils. 
Carnero soils are closer to the plateau margins and are moderately deep to sandstone bedrock. 
Gallinas soils are on stream terraces usually below the Beaubien soil in a stream valley system. They have a pachic mollic epipedon. 
Philmont soils are also on the plateau interfluve but are not formed in a sand sheet and therefore have fine textures in the control section with sand contents below 50 percent. 
Seelez soils form on plateau interfluves in sand sheets that are still somewhat active and therefore have not formed an argillic horizon. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage class: well drained
Permeability: moderate
Runoff: negligible on slopes less than 1 percent, low on 1 to 5 percent slopes, and moderate on 5 to 8 percent slopes

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for livestock grazing. Native vegetation is mixed warm and cool season grasses with some shrubs. They are correlated to the Sandy ecological site GX070A01X021.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern New Mexico, LRR G, in MLRA 70A along the Canadian Plateaus of the Southwestern Great Plains; LRU 70A.1 (Canadian Plateaus). The series is extensive.
