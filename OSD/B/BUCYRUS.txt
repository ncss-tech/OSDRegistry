BUCYRUS SERIES

The Bucyrus series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils. They formed in a thin mantle of loess and the underlying residuum weathered from limestone of Pennsylvanian age.  These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping summits, shoulders and side slopes on interfluves on plains in the Cherokee Prairies (MLRA 112).  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 13 degrees Celsius (56 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 1040 mm (41 inches).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bucyrus soils are on nearly level to gently sloping summits, shoulders and side slopes on interfluves of the plains in the Cherokee Prairies.  Slopes are 1 to 8 percent. They formed in a thin mantle of loess and the underlying material weathered from limestone of Pennsylvanian age.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 880 mm to 1095 mm (35 to 43 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 13 to 16 degrees C (55 to 62 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Aliceville, Claremore, Clareson, Eram, Kenoma, Shidler, Summit, Wagstaff, and Woodson soils.  The clayey-skeletal Clareson soils are above and below Bucyrus soils.  Kenoma soils have a decrease in clay content in the argillic horizon within 150 cm of the surface and are on similar landscapes. Summit soils do not have colors of 7.5YR or redder in the argillic horizon and occur on lower backslope and footslope positions.  Woodson soils have chroma of one or less in the upper part of the argillic horizon and are on broad interfluves, and summits.  Aliceville soils are 100 to 150 cm to bedrock and occur on similar areas of the landscape.  Claremore, Clareson, Eram, Shidler, and Wagstaff are less than 100 cm to bedrock and occur on similar areas of the landscape.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity: moderately high in the upper part and moderately low in the lower part.  A layer of episaturation occurs intermittently during periods of high rainfall in most years at depths greater than 75 cm, duration is long enough to create redoximorphic concentrations but not of sufficient duration to create redoximorphic depletions.

USE AND VEGETATION: Corn, soybeans, grain sorghum, and wheat are the principal crops.  Some areas are used for hay and pasture.  Native vegetation is tall grass prairie. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 112 (Cherokee Prairies). The series is of moderate extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Miami County, Kansas, 1994. 

REMARKS: Formerly these soils were mapped as Newtonia series in Kansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma. 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to 56 cm
argillic horizon--the zone from 56 to 180 cm
lithic contact--180 cm
slickensides--81 to 180 cm

WAW 8/2009  The classification and type location description for Bucyrus are being revised as part of an update project in MLRA 112.  The original concept was smectitic mineralogy.  Further investigation and data throughout the MLRA suggests mixed mineralogy is the most prevalent.  The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data.

The mean annual soil temperature at the type location and in the northern range of this series is slightly less than the 15 degrees C break for thermic soils.  The MLRA 112 boundary crosses the mesic thermic areas and for classification MLRA 112 soils are considered thermic.

ADDITIONAL DATA:
NSSC SSL Laboratory sample 94P0128 (pedon 93KS121001) is from the type location.
