BEEHUNT SERIES

The Beehunt series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium derived from sandstone. Beehunt soils are on mountain slopes and hillslopes. Slopes range from 20 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 406 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Beehunt extremely gravelly loam, on a northerly aspect, 66 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 1,951 meters. (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.)
