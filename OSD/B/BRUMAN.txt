BRUMAN SERIES

The Bruman series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from basic and intermediate igneous rocks.  Bruman soils are on fan terraces, mountainsides and hillsides.  Slopes are 2 to 70 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Ustic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bruman gravelly loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 10 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine, few medium and coarse roots; few fine tubular pores; 25 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Bk--10 to 31 inches; white (10YR 8/2) very gravelly loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 40 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (21 to 32 inches thick)

    C--31 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/1) very gravelly sand, gray (10YR 5/1) moist; massive; loose; few fine roots; interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; strong discontinuous cementation by carbonates; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  Garfield County, Utah; about 1/2 mile east of the Panguitch Airport, in the northeast 1/4 sec. 23, T. 34 S., R. 5 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 63 degrees F.  The soils are dry in parts of the moisture control section for 75 to 90 days during the winter months, and are dry in all parts of moisture control section 40 to 50 percent of the time when the soil temperature at 20 inches depth is more than 41 degrees F.

Solum thickness ranges from 31 to 39 inches.  Clay content of the particle size control section averages 8 to 18 percent.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Rock fragment content is 5 to 60 percent.  It is slightly to strongly effervescent.

The Bk horizon has value of 6 to 8 dry and 5 to 7 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is very gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly loam, and very cobbly sandy loam.  Rock fragment content is 35 to 60 percent.  It is strongly to violently effervescent.  Reaction in the Bk horizon is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

The C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is very cobbly sand, very gravelly loamy sand and very gravelly sand.  Clay content is 1 to 10 percent.  Rock fragment content is 40 to 70 percent.  It is moderately calcareous to strongly calcareous.  Reaction is moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Barkelew (CO), Bronell (CO), Brownsto (WY), Browtine (WY), and Bruja (WY) series.  Barkelew soils have cambic horizons and 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle size control section.   Bronell soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Brownsto soils have a cambic horizon and do not have sandy skeletal C horizon textures.  Bruja soils are moderately deep to bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bruman soils are on fan terraces, mountainsides, and hillsides.  Slopes are 2 to 70 percent.  Elevation is 6,500 to 7,500 feet.  These soils formed in alluvium from basic and intermediate igneous rocks.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is 8 to 13 inches.  Freeze-free period is 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ipson, Notter and Tridell series.  All of these soils occur in similar landscapes.  Ipson soils have an argillic horizon.  Notter soils have a fine-loamy particle size control section and have an argillic horizon. Tridell soils have a mollic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly as rangeland and woodland, a few areas are used for irrigated cropland.  Potential vegetation is black sagebrush, Wyoming big sagebrush, Indian ricegrass, pinyon, Utah juniper and blue grama.  Principal crops are alfalfa and small grains.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South Central Utah.  The series is of moderate extent. MLRA 35 and 47.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Garfield County, (Panguitch Soil Survey Area), Utah 1984.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to 10 inches. (A horizon)

Calcic horizon - the zone of carbonate accumulation from 10 to 31 inches. (Bk horizon)

The classification of the soil was changed from a loamy-skeletal, mixed Borollic Calciorthids to loamy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Ustic Haplocalcids on 9/94.

The superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Lakewood MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.
