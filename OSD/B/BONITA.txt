BONITA SERIES

The Bonita series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from basalt and related pyroclastic rock.  Bonita soils are on plateaus, fan piedmonts and relict basin floors and have slopes of 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Verhalen (TX) series.  Verhalen soils do not have buried paleosols at depths less than 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bonita soils are on floodplains, plateaus, terraces, fan piedmonts and basin floors at elevations of 3,500 to 5,000 feet.  These soils formed in alluvium from basalt, cinders and ash, with some influence from andesite and limestone.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 59 to 67 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 160 to 250 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the McAllister and White House soils.  These soils have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; very slow permeability.  Subject to very brief sheet flooding during July-September thunderstorms.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Bonita soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is tobosa, sideoats grama, vine mesquite, curly mesquite, Rothrock grama, yucca, cacti and scattered mesquite.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Arizona.  This series is of moderate extent.  MLRA is 41.
