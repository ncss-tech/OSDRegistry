BROADUS SERIES

The Broadus series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium derived from semiconsolidated loamy sedimentary beds.  These soils are on hills and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 8 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Broadus loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--1 inch to 0; slightly decomposed forest litter. (1/2 to 4 inches thick)

    A--0 to 4 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 8 inches thick)

    Bw--4 to 12 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 12 inches thick)

    Bk1--12 to 18 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many fine tubular pores; many fine  masses of lime; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); gradual smooth boundary. (7 to 18 inches thick)

    Bk2--18 to 34 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silty clay loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many fine and medium roots; many fine tubular pores; many medium and coarse masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); gradual smooth boundary. (12 to 20 inches thick)

    Bk3--34 to 60 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many fine roots; many fine tubular pores; many medium and coarse masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9).

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT0592.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches (mixed)(A and part of Bw horizons); a cambic horizon from 4 to 12 inches (Bw horizon); secondary carbonate accumulation from 12 to 60 inches (Bk1, Bk2, Bk3 horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bw, Bk1, Bk2, and part of Bk3 horizons).  The Broadus series has a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
