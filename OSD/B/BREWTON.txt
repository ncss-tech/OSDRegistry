BREWTON SERIES

 The Brewton series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy marine sediments.  These soils have water tables at 1 to 2 feet during winter and spring.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, siliceous, subactive, thermic Fragiaquic Paleudults

 TYPICAL PEDON:  Brewton fine sandy loam--forested.
                 (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

      A1--0 to 3 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) fine sandy loam;  weak fine granular structure; friable; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 7 inches thick)

(5 to 12 inches thick)

      B22t--21 to 36 inches; light gray (10YR 7/1) surfaces of prisms and material in polygonal cracks; mottled brownish yellow (10YR 6/6), strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), and red (2.5YR 5/8) interiors of prisms.  Prisms are fine sandy loam; weak coarse prismatic parting to weak very thick platy which parts to moderate medium subangular blocky structure; about 40 percent of the mass is firm, compact, and brittle; many thin patchy strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay films; many coarse vesicles lined with clay; few nodules of plinthite, 1/4 to 1/2 inch in diameter; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (7 to 30 inches thick)

      B23t--36 to 54 inches; mottled brownish yellow (10YR 6/6), light gray (10YR 7/1), red (2.5YR 5/8), and strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) sandy loam; few pockets of loamy sand and light sandy clay loam; weak very thick platy parting to medium subangular blocky structure; firm in place, hard and compact dry, about 50 percent of mass is brittle moist; light gray (10YR 7/1) areas are in the polygonal cracks; white sand in old root channels; many vesicular pockets lined with clay; few flakes of mica; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (2 to 24 inches thick)

      B3--54 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) sandy loam; common medium distinct yellow (2.5Y 7/6), strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) and common medium prominent light gray (N 7/0) mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few flakes of mica; very strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 16 inches thick)

      IIC1--60 to 72 inches; mottled light gray (10YR 7/1), yellow (10YR 7/8), and pink (5Y 7/4) clay; massive; firm; very strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 16 inches thick)

      IIC2--72 to 96 inches; stratified very pale brown (10YR 8/3) sand and yellow (10YR 7/6) loamy sand; single grained; loose.

 TYPE LOCATION:  Escambia County, Alabama; 1.3 miles south of Conecuh River on Alabama Highway 41 at east entrance to Brewton Airport, 100 feet west of road on east side of drainage ditch in the NW1/4SE1/4SE 1/4N1/4sec. 16, R. 10 E., T. 1 N.

 RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Depth to subhorizons with fragic properties and mottles of chroma 2 or less is 12 to 24 inches.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid, except where limed.

 The A1 horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or neutral; value of 2 through 4; and chroma of 1 or 2.  The A2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Texture of the A horizon is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.

 The B1 horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It has none to common mottles in shades of brown, yellow, and gray.  It has few to common uncoated sand grains.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam with more than 20 percent silt.

 The A'2 horizon is continuous in some pedons and in other pedons it makes up as little as 15 percent of the A'2 and B2t horizon. The A'2 material has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or neutral, value of 6 through 8, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.

 The B2t and B3 horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5through 8, and chroma of 1 through 8, or they are mottled in shades of these colors and red.  The B2t horizon has common to many uncoated sand grains and it is brittle in 40 to 60 percent of its volume.  Texture of the B2t and B3 horizons is sandy loam, fine sandy loam.loam, or silt loam.  Some pedons have thin subhorizons of sandy clay loam.

 The C horizon has the same hue, value, and chroma as the B2t and B3 horizons.  Texture ranges from sand to clay and in most pedons is stratified.

 COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Basin and Stough series in the same family and the Ackerville, Ardilla, Bowie, Carnegie, Cedarbluff, Cowarts, and Escambia series.  Ackerville and Escambia soils have more than 5 percent plinthite and do not have fragic horizons.  Ardilla and Cedarbluff soils contain more than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Basin soils have more than 5 percent plinthite in the fragic layers.  Bowie, Carnegie, and Cowarts soils lack chroma 2 mottles within 24 inches of the surface.  Stough soils do not have A'2 horizons.

 GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent but most slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The soil formed in marine fluvial deposits ranging in texture from sands to clay.  The climate is warm and humid.  Near the type location the average annual temperature is 66 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 58 inches.
 GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Craven, Kalmia, Lenoir, and Myatt series.  All of these soils lack fragipans and have more than 18 percent clay in the control section of the argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; permeability is moderate above the brittle layer and slow in the brittle layer; slow runoff.

 USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of the soil is in forest.  Small areas are used for pasture and crops.  Forested areas consist of slash, longleaf, and loblolly pine with some mixed hardwood and understory of gallberry and wiregrass.

 DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Coastal Plains of Alabama, Mississippi, Florida and possibly Arkansas, Louisiana, South Carolina, and Texas.  This soil is of moderate extent.
