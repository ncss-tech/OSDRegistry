BEECHCREEK SERIES

The Beechcreek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash influenced colluvium over residuum derived from rhyolite.  These soils occur on hills and mountain slopes. Slopes are 4 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 406 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-skeletal, glassy Vitrandic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Beechcreek gravelly ashy sandy loam, in rangeland on a 12 percent slope at an elevation of 2103 meters (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

        A--0 to 19 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly ashy sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 25 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (14 to 20 cm thick)

        Bt--19 to 36 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly ashy sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots;  many very fine and fine irregular pores;  95 percent distinct clay films on faces of peds and on rock fragments; 40 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary.  (15 to 38 cm thick)

        BC--36 to 61 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very gravelly ashy sandy clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist;  weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 45 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear irregular boundary. (0 to 30 cm thick)

        Cr--61 to 84 cm; light gray (2.5Y 7/1) decomposing volcanic ash influenced rhyolitic bedrock. (15 to 30 cm thick)

        R--84 cm; fractured volcanic ash influenced rhyolitic bedrock.
