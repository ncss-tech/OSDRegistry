COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bairs, Breko, Chiefrange, Cowgil, Drino, Hefed, Huilepass, Hunewill, Jungo, Kayo, Lithgo, Plush, Schader, Stucky, and Washoe series. 

Bairs, Cowgil, Drino, Hefed, Hunewill, Jungo, Kayo, Stucky, and Washoe soils are not intermittently moist in some part due to convection storms between July and September. Bairs soils have 5 to 30 percent granitic stones or boulders in the control section. Breko soils are effervescent in the argillic horizon and soil temperature warmer than 12 degrees C. Chiefridge, Drino, Lithgow, and Schader soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts. Huilepass soils have a clay content of 12 to 20 percent and rock fragments of 60 to 75 percent in the control section. Kayo soils have a clay content of 13 to 18 percent in the particle-size control section. Plush soils have lithic contact at 100 to 150 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Basket soils are on sideslopes, shoulders and summits of fan remnants and eroded pediment remnants at elevations of 1,800 to 2,100 meters. They formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff over lacustrine deposits. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. The climate is semiarid and cool, with a mean annual precipitation of 250 to 300 mm. The mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C. The frost free season is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Decathon, Homestake, and Satt soils. Decathon soils have fine, loamy particle-size control sections and have duripans.  Homestake soils have mollic epipedons and clayey-skeletal particle-size control sections.  Satt soils are clayey-skeletal, moderately deep to duripans, and have mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used principally for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation is primarily Wyoming big sagebrush, spiny hopsage, Indian ricegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail and needleandthread. This site is correlated to Ecological Site R028AY015NV, Loamy 8-10. The site is readily invaded by singleleaf pinyon and Utah juniper. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 28A.

REMARKS:  Basket soils were formerly classified as Brown soils.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the surface to 10 cm (A1 and A2 horizons).
Argillic horizon - The zone from 10 to 71 cm (Bt1, Bt2 Bt3 and Bt4 horizons).
Silica cementation - The zone from 71 to 152 cm (2Cq and 2Cqk horizons).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 50 cm (Bt1, Bt2 and part of Bt3 horizons).

ADDITIONAL DATA: The type was moved 10/2008 to better reflect the series concept. The series concept was changed from frigid to mesic. 
Previous authors include LR/LNL/ELS/JVC.
The concept where Basket series was used in the Big Smokey Area should be reviewed.
