BATAN SERIES

The Batan series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks, loess, and volcanic ash.  Batan soils are on stream terraces, flood plains, and alluvial flat remnants. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lander County, Nevada; about 6.2 miles southeast of Battle Mountain; approximately 1,585 feet west and 1,585 feet north of the approximate southeast corner of section 31, T. 32 N., R. 46 E.; USGS Bateman Spring 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 36 minutes 5 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 49 minutes 50 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.6013889 latitude, -116.8305556 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in winter and spring, dry in late May through early November; typic aridic (torric) moisture regime; There is a water table influence at depths immediately below 150 cm.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 12 degrees C.
Depth to durinodes: 23 to 60 cm.
Salinity and sodicity: Most pedons are salt and sodium affected. Some pedons near drainageways and stream channels lack salt and sodium in the upper horizons.
Redox concentrations: Faint or distinct iron concentrations are common in any horizon below 25 cm.
Gypsum: Gypsum crystals are in some pedons below depth of 50 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 20 to 30 percent.

Durinodes: 20 to 40 percent; some pedons have subhorizons with up to 70 percent discontinuous weak silica cementation.

2C horizon (when present)
Some pedons have unconformable stratified very gravelly sands and fine sands at depths below 127 cm.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Boton and Uwell series. 

Boton soils have lacustrine sediment at 25 to 50 cm and have a mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 14 degrees C. Uwell soils have a Bk horizon within 10 cm of the surface and have a aridic soil moisture regime that borders on xeric.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Batan soils are on stream terraces, flood plains, and alluvial flat remnants. These soils formed in silty alluvium form mixed rock sources of mostly volcanic origin that are high in loess and pyroclastic material. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Elevations are 1,220 to 1,865 meters. The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm; mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bubus, Hessing, Landco, Ocala, Relley, Rosney and Sonoma soils. Bubus soils are coarse-loamy control sections. Hessing soils are coarse-loamy and have less than 20 percent durinodes in the Bq horizon. Landco, Rosney, and Sonoma soils lack a Bq horizon. Landco soil also are coarse-silty over clayey, and Sonoma soils are saturated at some period in most years. Ocala soils are somewhat poorly drained.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. Some areas are subject to occasional flooding.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Batan soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. Small acreages have been reclaimed and are cropped to alfalfa hay. The vegetation on salt and sodium affected areas is principally weak greasewood, shadscale, littleleaf horsebrush, suaeda, and basin wildrye. On less salt and sodium affected areas vegetation is principally bud sagebrush, saltbush, bottlebrush squirreltail, pepperweed, and other mustards.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Nevada.  These soils are extensive with about 101,000 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 24.
