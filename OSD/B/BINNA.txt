BINNA SERIES

The Binna series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 305 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Binna loam, cultivated (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 23 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine roots; many fine pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (18 to 38 cm thick)

    Bk1--23 to 33 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine roots; many fine pores; finely disseminated carbonates; 10 percent gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.

    Bk2--33 to 61 cm; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine roots; many fine pores; carbonate coats on the surfaces of rock fragments; common distinct soft calcium carbonate masses in the matrix and distinct carbonate casts on the bottom of rock fragments; 10 percent gravel; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); clear wavy boundary.

    Bk3--61 to 71 cm; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) gravelly sandy loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; massive; hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; distinct carbonate coats on surfaces of rock fragments; finely disseminated carbonates and prominent carbonate casts on bottom of rock fragments; 20 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual boundary. (Combined thickness of Bk horizons is 20 to 89 cm)

    2Bk4--71 to 104 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) very gravelly loamy sand, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; single grain; loose; slightly sticky and nonplastic; finely disseminated carbonates and distinct carbonate casts on bottom of rock fragments; 60 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0). (0 to 38 cm thick)

    2C--104 to 152 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) very gravelly loamy sand, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; single grain; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; finely disseminated carbonates; 60 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.
