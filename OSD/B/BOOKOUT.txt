BOOKOUT SERIES

The Bookout series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in calcareous loamy and clayey alluvium. These soils occur on stream terraces on inland dissected coastal plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 21.7 degrees C (71 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 533 mm (21 in).

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; Permeability is moderate to moderately slow; Runoff is negligible on less than 1 percent slopes and low to medium on 1 to 5 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mostly for irrigated cropland, rangeland, and wildlife habitat.  A few areas are nonirrigated cropland.  With retrogression on rangeland, such plants as threeawn, curly mesquite, hooded windmillgrass, Hall's panicum, fall witchgrass, and red grama increase or invade, and are dominant on most areas. A wide array of brush plants also increase and invade such as mesquite, guajillo, condalia, paloverde, guyacan, twisted acacia, whitebrush, and pricklypear. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Texas; LRR I; MLRA 83A - Northern Rio Grande Plain.  The series is of large extent.
