GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cocharan, Crawl, Endeavor Ittsanapper, and Tea Hammock soils.

Cocharan soils--are on mainland coves and have limnic materials
Crawl soils--are on nearby anthropogenic landforms in deep (> 4 meters) dredge channels primarily used for navigation throughout the waterbody
Endeavor soils--are on relict flood-tidal delta sand flats and slopes and have considerable shell fragments throughout
Ittsanapper soils--are on lagoon bottom landforms, usually at deeper water depths, and have thicker finer textured materials
Tea Hammock soils--are also on nearby anthropogenic landforms consisting of dredge shoal deposits

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--Subaqueous
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--High or very high
Soil moisture regime--Peraquic
Soil is continuously inundated by saline and brackish water.

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major uses--Used for recreational boating, fishing, and swimming, marinas, mooring fields, and commercial shellfish harvesting; benthic species include tubeworms, clams, crabs, scallops and juvenile finfish.
Native vegetation--Dominant vegetation is driven by water quality and quantity within subaqueous systems. Under excellent water quality these soils support seagrass species including but not limited to shoalweed (Halodule wrightii), manatee grass (Syringodium filiforme), and Englemann's seagrass (Halophila englemannii). Shallower areas may support widgeongrass (Ruppia maritima). Under degraded / poor water quality seagrass may be replaced by rooted eukaryotic macroalgae in the green (Chlorophyta), red (Rhodophyta), and brown (Phaeophyta) algae families. Caulerpa prolifera (Chlorophyta) is often dominant. Vegetative cover ranges from 0 through 80 percent."

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
General area--Located along the coasts of Indian River Lagoon, Florida
Land Resource Regions--U - Florida Subtropical Fruit, Truck Crop, and Range Region
MLRA(s)--155
Extent--Small
