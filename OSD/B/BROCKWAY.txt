BROCKWAY SERIES

The Brockway series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in silty loess, lake sediments and alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, hills and lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Calciustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Brockway silt loam, cultivated (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Ap--0 to 6 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick) 

    Bk1--6 to 11 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silt loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; weak medium prismatic structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many fine and very fine tubular pores; disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick) 

    Bk2--11 to 18 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) stratified silty clay loam and silt loam; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak thin platy; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine roots; many fine tubular pores; common grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist coatings on faces of peds; disseminated calcium carbonate; many fine and medium coatings and seams of calcium carbonate on faces of peds; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (6 to 20 inches thick) 

    Bk3--18 to 28 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) silty clay loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; moderate very thin strata of dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist silty clay and light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist silt loam; moderate very thin platy structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; common fine tubular pores; disseminated calcium carbonate; many fine and medium coatings and seams of calcium carbonate on faces of plates; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (6 to 18 inches thick) 

    C--28 to 39 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) very fine sandy loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common fine tubular pores; disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (6 to 20 inches thick) 

    Cy--39 to 60 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) very fine sandy loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist with thin strata of light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silty clay, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) moist; average texture is silty clay loam; thin and very thin varves; very fine sandy loam layers are soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; silty clay layers are hard, firm, sticky and slightly plastic; many seams and masses of gypsum crystals; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).
