TYPE LOCATION: Washington County, North Carolina; approximately 8 miles south of Roper and 3 miles southeast of Whitehurst's north slope grain elevator, 50 feet west of Canal "C" and 0.15 mile south of Canal #1. (Approximate location of Dolman site #4; see additional data).

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Thickness of Organic Layers: 16 to 51 inches
Depth to Bedrock: Greater than 60 inches
Depth to Seasonal High Water Table: 0 to 12 inches, November to May
Soil Reaction: Organic layers are ultra acid to extremely acid (in 0.01 M CaCl2) except where the surface has been limed. The underlying mineral horizons are extremely acid through moderately alkaline
Fiber content of Oa horizons: 15 percent to 45 percent unrubbed and less than 10 percent rubbed. The amount of fiber is highest in the lower tier. The organic material of this layer has a slick feel and is paste-like(colloidal). It is massive under natural wet conditions. Upon aeration after drainage, structure of the organic material evolves. Excessive drying causes shrinkage and hard subangular blocky peds to form. These peds dry irreversibly.
Other Features: Logs, stumps, and fragments of wood occupy 0 to 5 percent of the upper organic horizons in cleared areas that are cultivated and 5 to 35 percent in undrained areas. Pieces of charcoal range from common (2 to 8 percent) in the upper tier to few (less than 2 percent) in the lower tiers 

Oa horizon (upper tier):
Color--hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 2 or 3. Ten inches or more of the upper tier is in hue of 5YR or 2.5YR
Texture--muck

Oa horizon (lower tier):
Color--hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 2 or 3
Texture--muck

AC horizon or A horizon (where present):
Color--hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 2 or 3
Texture--fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam, and includes the mucky texture modifier

C horizon (where present):
Color--hue of 2.5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3
Texture--sandy loam, loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam

Cg horizon:
Color--hue of 2.5YR to 5Y, 5GY or 5G, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2 , or is neutral with value of 4 to 7. The low chroma colors are the result of iron depletion caused by wetness.
Texture--sandy loam, loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam or is stratified sandy to clayey sediment.
Redoximorphic features (where present)--masse of oxidized iron in shades of brown, yellow, or red and iron depletions in shades of gray, olive, or white

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Agricultural Drainage Class: Very poorly drained
Permeability: Moderately slow to moderately rapid

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses: Mostly woodland
Dominant Vegetation: Where wooded--plant communities that reflect past history of treatment. Areas with a history of severe burning have scattered pond pine and a dense undergrowth of both large holly and small gallberry and huckleberry, fetterbush lyonia, swamp cyrilla, loblollybay gordonia, greenbrier and southern bayberry, as well as scattered red maple, red bay, sweetbay magnolia, and reeds. Similar areas may have a smaller population of these species and contain large amounts of broomsedge. Areas without severe burning have red maple, Southern bald cypress, pond pine, Atlantic white-cedar, red bay, sweet bay, and other hydrophytic species. Where cultivated--corn, soybeans, small grain, and pasture. 
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Distribution: Lower Coastal Plain of North Carolina and Virginia 
Extent: Moderate
