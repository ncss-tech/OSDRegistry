DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Distribution: South Carolina 
Extent: Moderate

SERIES ESTABLISHED: York County, South Carolina, 2009.

REMARKS: This soil was formerly included with the Iredell and Pittsboro soils. Iredell soils are well drained and Pittsboro soils are moderately well drained.  
The May 2025 revision reformatted the description to semi-tabular.  No data was changed.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches) (Ap and E horizons).
Argillic horizon--the zone from 15 to 76 centimeters (6 to 30 inches) (Bt, Btss, and BCt horizons).
Aquertic feature--iron depletions in upper 25 centimeters (10 inches) of Bt horizon and a linear extensibility of 6.0 or more between the surface and the paralithic contact.
