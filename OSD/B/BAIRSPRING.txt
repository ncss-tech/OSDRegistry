BAIRSPRING SERIES 

The Bairspring series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from igneous or sedimentary rock.  These soils are on escarpments, hills, ridges and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 8 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 2.8 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bairspring cobbly loam, in forest (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 3 cm; slightly decomposed needles and twigs.  (0 to 4 cm thick)

    A1--3 to 11 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) cobbly loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 15 percent gravel, 10 percent cobble; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear smooth boundary. 

    A2--11 to 23 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) very cobbly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 15 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of A horizons is 18 to 25 cm). 

    Bw1--23 to 51 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely cobbly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 25 percent gravel, 40 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual smooth boundary. (25 to 45 cm thick)

    C--51 to 72 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely cobbly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsicky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots and few medium roots; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; 25 percent gravel, 45 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. 

    R--72 inches; hard, slightly fractured rhyolite.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES PROPOSED: Meagher County, Montana, 2014.  The name is from a nearby spring. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - from 3 to 23 cm (A1, A2 horizons)
