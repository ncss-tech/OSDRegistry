BECHTEL SERIES

The Bechtel series consists of deep, well drained soils on foothills. They formed in material weathered from siltite of the Libby, Wallace and Prichard formations and fine grained quartzites of the Striped Peak formation of the Belt supergroup with a mixed mantle of loess and volcanic ash. Permeability is moderately slow. Slope ranges from 20 to 40 percent. The average annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F and average annual precipitation is about 38 inches.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Christoff, Keeler and Sly series. 

Christoff soils: moderately well drained; E horizons with more than 60 percent volcanic ash and 5 to 10 percent hard weathered cinders; have 2E and 2Bt horizons with 5 to 15 percent gravel from breccia and tuffaceous rocks. 

Keeler soils: greater than 60 inches to bedrock; 2Bt horizons with sandy loam or sandy clay loam textures derived from granite. 

Sly soils:  greater than 60 inches to bedrock; 2Bt horizons with silty clay loam textures and 25 to 38 percent clay; derived from basalt.

Soils with a similar classification
Placer soils: isotic mineralogy; 2Bt horizons with 5YR or 7.5YR hue and pararock and rock fragments of basalt origin. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bechtel soils are on south, east, and west facing convex foothills. Slopes range from 20 to 40 percent. These soils formed in material weathered from siltite of the Libby, Wallace and Prichard formations and fine grained quartzites of the Striped Peak formation of the Belt supergroup with a mantle of loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash. Elevations range from 2,800 to 3,500 feet. The average annual air temperature ranges from 43 to 45 degrees F, average annual precipitation is 30 to 40 inches, and frost-free season is from 90 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ahrs, Helmer, Hobnail, Honeyjones, and Reggear soils. Ahrs soils are on mountains, and are loamy-skeletal and lack argillic horizons. Helmer and Reggear soils are on terraces, and have a fragipan and are moderately well drained. Hobnail soils are on terraces and are moderately well drained. Honeyjones soils are on north-facing mountains, and are ashy over loamy-skeletal and very deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, recreation, and a few areas for homesites. Potential natural vegetation is mainly grand fir, Douglas-fir, western white pine, ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine, and western larch, with an understory of myrtle pachystima, queencup beadlily, baldhip rose, common snowberry, longtube twinflower, piper anemone, American trailplant, goldthread, Columbia brome, and sedge.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Idaho. This soil is not extensive.
