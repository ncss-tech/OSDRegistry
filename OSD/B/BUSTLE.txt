BUSTLE SERIES

The Bustle series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess over alluvium.  Bustle soils are on hills and have slopes of 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3.3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive Pachic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bustle silt loam on a hill with 6 percent slope at an elevation of 1,957 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 Ap1--0 to 12 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam; very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots throughout; many very fine irregular pores;  moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear smooth boundary.

 Ap2--12 to 34 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam; very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; moderately hard, friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots throughout; many very fine irregular and common very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Ap horizons is 10 to 34 cm)

 Bt1--34 to 48 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to strong medium subangular blocky; very hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots throughout; many very fine and common fine tubular pores; many (75 percent) prominent skeletans, few (12 percent) prominent clay films and few (13 percent) distinct clay films; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary.

 Bt2--48 to 100 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam; dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium subangular blocky; very hard, very friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; common medium and fine roots throughout; many very fine and common fine and medium tubular pores; common (30 percent) prominent skeletans and many (70 percent) prominent clay films; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt1 and Bt2 horizons is 36 to 90 cm)

 Bt3--100 to 116 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; very hard, very friable, moderately sticky, slightly plastic; few very fine roots throughout; many very fine and common fine and very fine tubular pores; common (25 percent) prominent skeletans and common (25 percent) prominent clay films; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.

 Bt4--116 to 152 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very friable, moderately sticky, nonplastic; few very fine roots throughout; many very fine and common fine tubular pores; few (15 percent) prominent clay films; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Mollic epipedon thickness: 50 to 100 cm
Particle size control section total clay: 21 to 27 percent
Soil moisture regime: udic
Mean annual soil temperature: 3.9 to 7.2 degrees C.
Mean summer soil temperature: 10 to 15 degrees C.
Some pedons have an O horizon, and where present, the mean annual soil temperature is 5 to 8 degrees C

A or Ap horizons
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR moist
Value: 2 or 2.5 moist, 4 or 5 dry

Bt horizons
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR moist
Value: 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry
Chroma: 2 to 4 moist, 3 or 4 dry

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bozeman, Jedediah (T), Greybo, Lanark Robana, and Pinebutte soil series.  Bozeman soils have continuous horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation.  Jedediah (T) soils have EB or BE horizons, have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle size control section and have formed in loess over rhyolite.  Greybo soils have an argillic horizon comprised of lamellae.  Lanark soils have a calcic horizon.  Robana soils have an ustic soil moisture regime.  Pinebutte soils are deep to bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: outwash plain
Landform: loess hill
Elevation: 1,933 to 2,006 meters
Slope: 2 to 20 percent
Parent material: loess over alluvium
Mean annual air temperature: 2.8 to 5.0 degrees C.
Mean annual precipitation: 457 to 660 mm
Frost free period: 30 to 55 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Driggs and Ririe series.  Driggs soils are on swales and toe slopes and are loamy-skeletal.  Ririe soils are on south slopes and have a calcic horizon.
