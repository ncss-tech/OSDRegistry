BOATMAN SERIES

The Boatman series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from sedimentary, metamorphic, or igneous rock sources. Boatman soils are on fan remnants, escarpments and mountain slopes. Slopes range from 15 to 80 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 710 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Pachic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Boatman very gravelly loam on a 75 percent north facing slope at about 2195 meters elevation. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Oi--0 to 7 cm; slightly decomposed forest litter; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 8 cm thick)

   A--7 to 23 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak, fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 40 percent gravel and less than 1 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (14 to 25 cm thick)

   Bw1--23 to 44 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium and fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 40 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary.

   Bw2--44 to 87 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 35 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual wavy boundary. (combined thickness of the Bw horizons - 40 to 100 cm)

   BC--87 to 152 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely gravelly sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 45 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.2).
