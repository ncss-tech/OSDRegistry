BANSHEE SERIES

The Banshee series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium from prehistoric lakes and marshes and fan alluvium.  Banshee soils are on alluvial fans. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, mixed, active, thermic Vertic Paleargids 

TYPICAL PEDON: Banshee sandy loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 0 to 10 percent of the surface is covered with gravel and cobbles. Continuous cracks from the surface to 19 inches with each crack from 0.12 to 0.50 inches wide in profile.

    A/C--0 to 3 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/2) moist; moderate thin platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; common fine irregular pores; 10 percent gravel; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt--3 to 19 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong medium prismatic parting to strong fine and medium angular blocky structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on ped faces; common pressure faces; noneffervescent to slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (12 to 20 inches thick)

    Btk--19 to 26 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, very sticky and very plastic; common fine and medium roots; common fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on ped faces and rock fragments; many calcium carbonate coatings on ped faces and rock fragments; common calcium carbonate filaments; 5 percent gravel; slightly effervescent to strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 12 inches thick)

    2Bkyg--26 to 42 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clay, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; common medium tubular pores; common distinct organic coatings on ped faces; many fine soft calcium carbonate and gypsum masses; noneffervescent to slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); abrupt wavy boundary.  (10 to 20 inches thick)

    3Cg--42 to 60 inches; white (10YR 8/1) cobbly fine sandy loam, light gray (10YR 7/2) moist; massive; soft and slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and medium tubular pores; common hard brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) and brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) iron masses; 10 percent gravel and 20 percent cobble; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Banshee soils are on alluvial fans at elevations of 3,900 to 4,400 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium from prehistoric lakes and marshes and fan alluvium.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December to February.  The mean annual air temperature is 60 to 67 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 230 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Mallet, Hooks, Altar, and Bodecker soils.  Mallet soils have less than 18 percent clay.  Hooks soils have between 18 and 35 percent clay.  Altar soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments.  Bodecker soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments and are in drainageways.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; medium to slow runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation includes tobosa, sideoats grama, and other annual grasses and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Arizona.  Banshee soils are of minor extent.  MLRA is 41.
