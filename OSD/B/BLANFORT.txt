BLANFORT SERIES

The Blanfort series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over alluvium derived from calcareous sandstone. Blanfort soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 0 to 9 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Fuertes and Uracca soils.
Fuertes soils are fine-loamy and located on stream terraces.
Uracca soils are loamy-skeletal and located on fan remnants.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well or somewhat excessively drained; slow runoff; moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used principally for rangeland. Typical vegetation consists of Wyoming Big Sage, needlegrass, snakeweed, rabbitbrush and Pygmy Sage.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 2 inches 
Cambic horizon: 2 to 16 inches (5 to 25 centimeters) 
Calcic horizon: 16 to 28 inches (25 to 71 centimeters)

The assignment of the Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
