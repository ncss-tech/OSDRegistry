BRYSTAL SERIES

The Brystal series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous sandy clay loams derived from interbedded sandstone.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on toeslopes of broad interfluves. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 51 cm (20 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (71 degrees F).

All of these soils, except Brundage, occur on similar surfaces. Brundage soils occur at lower elevations. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderate permeability.  Mottles in the Btk horizon are considered to be relic redoximorphic features.

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly rangeland, but a few areas are dry farmed or irrigated to grain sorghums, vegetables, citrus, and tame pasture. Native grasses are bristlegrass, tanglehead, pink pappusgrass, hooded windmillgrass, sand dropseed, threeawn, and red grama. Woody plants are blackbrush, paloverde, guayacan, mesquite, pricklypear cactus, leatherstem, whitebrush, catclaw, Texas colubrina, and tasajillo. Ragweed and lantana are conspicuous forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern and Western Rio Grande Plain of Texas. MLRA 83A, 83B; LRR I; moderate extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Maverick County, Texas; 1972. 

REMARKS: This series was formerly included in the Reddish Chestnut great soil 
group. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 in). (A horizon)
Argillic horizon: 18 to 203 cm (7 to 80 in). (Bt and Btk horizons)
Pale feature: clay content does not significantly decrease from the maximum above 152 cm (60 in) and contains a hue of 7.5YR and chroma of 6 or more in the lower half of the argillic.

Additional Comments: The soil horizon depths were originally measured using American English units. The series was updated as part of the initial soil survey of McMullen County, Texas when the addition of electrical conductivity, sodium adsorption ratio, and salt accumulations were added.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from soils that formed in similar sediments. 

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Particle-size analysis, salinity and sodicity tests were performed at the project office on three pedons (S10TX3114600, S09TX3112029, S10TX3112023) from McMullen County, TX.
