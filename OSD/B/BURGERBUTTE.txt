BURGERBUTTE SERIES

The Burgerbutte series consists of shallow, well drained soils on ridges, shoulders and backslopes of mountains. Burgerbutte soils formed in basalt colluvium with a minor influence of volcanic ash. Slopes are 0 to 90 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches and mean annual temperature about 33 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, isotic Lithic Humicryepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Burgerbutte extremely cobbly ashy sandy loam - rangeland, on a 30 percent southfacing slope at an elevation of 7,200 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

  A--0 to 10 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) extremely cobbly ashy sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) dry; common fine subangular blocky and weak fine granular structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine, and few medium roots throughout; common fine irregular pores; 20 percent gravel, 35 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 12 inches thick)

  Bw--10 to 18 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) extremely cobbly ashy loam, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) dry; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine, and few medium roots throughout; few fine irregular pores; 25 percent gravel, 35 percent cobbles, and 15 percent stones; moderately acid (pH 6.0); abrupt irregular boundary. (6 to 10 inches thick)

  R--18 inches; basalt.
