BOTON SERIES

The Boton series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in a thin layer of loess and alluvium derived from mixed rocks influenced by volcanic ash over lacustrine sediments. Boton soils are on lake plains and basin floor remnants. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.
