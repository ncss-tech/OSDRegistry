SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Yakima County, Washington; 1947

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon
*Mollic epipedon--zone from the surface to a depth of 48 cm
*Cambic horizon--zone from 36 to 89 cm
*Carbonate accumulation--zone from 89 to 107 cm
*Particle-size control section--zone from 25 to 100 cm

Further study of the zone from 48 to 66 cm is needed to determine whether it is part of the mollic epipedon.
