BASCOVY SERIES

The Bascovy series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and residuum from semiconsolidated shale and mudstone.  These soils are on sedimentary plains, hills, alluvial fans, and strath terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Aridic Leptic Haplusterts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bascovy clay, grassland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

    Bss--6 to 10 inches; olive gray (5Y 5/2) clay, olive gray (5Y 4/2) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; few vertical cracks less than 1/4 inch wide; common faint slickensides or pressure faces; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 24 inches thick)

    Bssy--10 to 15 inches; olive gray (5Y 5/2) clay, olive gray (5Y 5/2) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; common distinct slickensides; few fine threads of gypsum; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary. (5 to 13 inches thick)

    BC--15 to 23 inches; olive gray (5Y 5/2) clay, olive gray (5Y 4/2) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic, few fine pores; 15 percent hard shale chips; moderately acid (pH 5.6); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 6 inches thick)

    Cr--23 to 60 inches; olive gray and olive brown semiconsolidated shale.

COMPETING SERIES:  As currently and previously (Udorthentic Chromusterts) classified.  Reclassification of the outdated Chromusterts may affect this list of series.

Aaberg (CO) - does not have a horizon of gypsum accumulations.

Abor (MT) - has a horizon of lime accumulation.

Barkof (MT) - does not have a horizon of gypsum accumulation; has precipitation less than 15 inches.

Binco (CO) - does not have a paralithic contact above a depth of 40 inches.

Bulkley (CO) - does not have a paralithic contact above a depth of 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - sedimentary plains; hills; alluvial fans; strath terraces.

Elevation - 2,400 to 3,800 feet.

Slope - 0 to 45 percent.

Parent material - material weathered from semiconsolidated shale and mudstone.

Climate - cold, dry winters; warm summers.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained. Very slow permeability.  Runoff is medium to very high depending on slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Bascovy soils are used for range; some areas are used for dryland cropland.  Potential native vegetation is western wheatgrass, prairie junegrass, blue grama, forbs, and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Bascovy soils are of moderate extent in central and eastern Montana.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Blaine County, Montana, 1976.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT0281.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 7 inches (A1, A2, and part of Bss horizons); slickensides - from 6 to 15 inches (Bss and Bssy horizons); transition horizon - the zone from 15 to 23 inches (BC horizon); and a paralithic contact - at a depth of 23 inches.   Bascovy soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.
