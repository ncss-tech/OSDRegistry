BUZZPEAK SERIES

The Buzzpeak series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum colluvium and slope alluvium from sandstone or conglomerate. Buzzpeak soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes range from 5 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches (355 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F (17 degrees C).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, thermic Typic Haploxerepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Buzzpeak, on a south facing slope under a cover of coastal sage at an elevation of 371 meters. When described the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

TYPE LOCATION:  Los Angeles County, Buzzard Peak on steep sideslope of NW finger midslope above landslide, 34 degrees, 3 minutes, 33 seconds and 117 degrees, 50 minutes North latitude, 53 seconds West longitude, NAD83 - U.S.G.S Quad: San Dimas

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

The MAST at a depth of 20 inches is 60 to 66 degrees F.  
The soil temperature usually does not go below 47 degrees F.  
The soil becomes moist below a depth of about 12 inches some time from October to December and remains moist in some part between depths of about 12 to 35 inches until April or May.  

Rock fragments make up 5 to 35 percent by volume. 
Depth to paralithic materials is 100 to 150 centimeters. 
Clay content ranges from 1 to 8 percent.  
The soils are slightly acidic to neutral and do not contain calcium carbonate.
Rock fragments on the surface range from 0 to 30 percent gravel.

The particle size control section averages 1 to 7 percent clay and 5 to 35 percent rock fragments. Textures in the particle-size control section are sands and loamy sands often with coarse fragment modifiers.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Buzzpeak soils are on sideslopes and crests of hills and mountains. Slopes are 5 to 90 percent. These soils formed in residuum colluvium and slope alluvium weathered from sandstone or conglomerate. Elevation is 200 to 500 meters (656 to 1640 feet). Mean annual precipitation is 280 to 833 millimeters (11 to 33 inches). The mean annual temperature is 15 to 17 degrees C (56 to 65 degrees F). Frost free season is 355 to 365 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Soper, Agua Dulce, and Tujunga soils. The Agua Dulce and Soper soils have an argillic horizon.  The Tujunga soil does not have a cambic and paralithic contact.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; high runoff; rapid permeability. The soils are not flooded or ponded for any part of the water year.  Depth to water table is >2 meters.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is dominantly open land and used for recreation. Vegetation is chaparral.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The series is not extensive in MLRA 20.
