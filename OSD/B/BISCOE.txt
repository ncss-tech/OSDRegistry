MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES PROPOSED: Montgomery County, North Carolina; 2007.

REMARKS: Biscoe soils were originally proposed under the name Callistone soils.  Because of the similarity to the Callison series name, the name was changed.  Biscoe soils were formerly included with Callison and Cid soils in mapping. Callison and Cid soils are moderately well drained and Cid soils have a fine particle-size control section and are deep to hard bedrock.
Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 20 
centimeters (about 0 to 8 inches) (A and BE horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 20 to 58 centimeters (about 8 to 23 inches) (Bt and Btg horizons)
Aquic conditions--periodic saturation and reduction within 7 to 58 centimeters (about 3 to 23 inches) of the surface, and one or more unsaturated layers within 200 centimeters ( about 79 inches) of the surface, occurring below the periodically saturated zone (episaturation)
Redox concentrations--the zone from 7 to 58 centimeters (about 3 to 23 inches)
Redox depletions with chroma 2 or less--the zone from 7 to 58 centimeters (about 3 to 23 inches)
Paralithic contact--soft bedrock contact at a depth of 58 centimeters (about 23 inches)
Paralithic materials--the zone from 58 to 104 centimeters (about 23 to 41 inches) (Cr layer)
Hard bedrock--bedrock contact at a depth of 104 centimeters (about 41 inches) (R layer)
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 104 centimeters (about 0 to 41 inches)
