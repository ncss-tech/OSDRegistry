BELMORE SERIES

The Belmore series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy and gravelly outwash and are underlain by gravelly, sandy, and loamy outwash deposits. They are on terraces, outwash plains, and glacial drainage channels. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Typic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Belmore loam, on a convex, 1 percent slope in a cultivated field at an elevation of 235 meters (770 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Amanda, Belmont, Caprell, Chili, Cliftycreek, Conestoga, Crouse, Gallman, Greybrook, Hickory, High Gap, Hollinger, Kanawha, Kidder, Kosciusko, LeRoy, Lumberton, Martinsville, Military, Mocksville, Ockley, Pignut, Princeton, Relay, Richardville, Riddles, Senachwine, Skelton, Strawn, Wawaka, Wawasee, and Woodbine series. Amanda, Crouse, Greybrook, Hickory, Martinsville, Princeton, Richardville, Riddles, Senachwine, and Strawn soils average less than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Belmont, High Gap, Lumberton, Military, Pignut, and Woodbine soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Caprell, Skelton, and Wawasee soils average less than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Chili and Kanawha soils are more acid than slightly alkaline in the lower part of the series control section. Cliftycreek and Gallman soils are deeper than 140 cm (55 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Conestoga soils have rock fragments of quartzite, chert, and schist in the series control section. Hollinger soils have chroma of more than 4 in the middle and lower parts of the series control section and typically have rock fragments of quartz, limestone, and schist in the series control section. Kidder soils formed in till and are not stratified in the lower part of the series control section. Kosciusko soils are coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction in the lower part of the series control section. LeRoy soils have rock fragments of limestone and chert. Mocksville soils are in a wetter climate with a mean annual precipitation of more than 991 mm (39 inches). Ockley soils average less than 5 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Relay soils have rock fragments of gabbro, metagabbro, and granodiorite. Wawaka soils have sola more than 140 cm (55 inches) in thickness.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Belmore soils are on terraces, outwash plains, and glacial drainage channels. Slope gradients are typically 0 to 12 percent but range from 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 1067 mm (27 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 13 degrees C (45 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 151 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the somewhat poorly drained Digby, moderately well drained Haney, and very poorly drained Millgrove soils that form a toposequence with the Belmore soils. The Digby and Haney soils are on less sloping or lower-lying areas. The Millgrove soils are in depressions

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the solum and very high in the underlying material. Permeability is moderately rapid in the solum and rapid in the underlying material.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Belmore soils are cultivated. Corn, soybeans, wheat, oats, and hay are principal crops. Some areas are used for fruit, early truck crops, and sugar beets.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern and west-central Ohio and northern Indiana; mainly in MLRAs 99 and 111B, and of lesser extent in 111A and 111E. The type location is in MLRA 111B. The series is of moderate extent.
