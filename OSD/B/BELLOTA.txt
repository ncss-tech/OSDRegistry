BELLOTA SERIES

The Bellota series consists of moderately deep to duripan, well and moderately well drained soils formed in material weathered from weakly to moderately consolidated andesitic tuffaceous sediments overlain by alluvium from mixed rock sources. Bellota soils are on hills. Slope ranges from 2 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm. Mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C.

The 2Cr has colors similar to the 2Bqm horizon.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Bellota soils are on footslope positions on hillslopes at elevations of 40 to 105 meters. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent and are commonly concave. These soils formed in material weathered from consolidated andesitic tuffaceous sediments overlain by colluvium derived from remnant terrace alluvium of mixed origin. Climate is Mediterranean with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 400 to 450 mm. Mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C; average January temperature is 7 degrees C, and the average July temperature is 25 degrees C. The frost-free period is 250 to 275 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hicksville, Keyes, Pardee, Pentz and Peters soils. Hicksville soils lack a duripan and are on low stream terraces. Keyes soils have greater than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and a duripan at less than 50 cm. They are on fans, terraces and low hills with mound-swale microrelief. Pentz (backslopes) and Peters (toeslopes) soils do not have a duripan and have a paralithic contact at 25 to 50 cm. Pardee soils have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and occur on summits of ridges that are erosion remnants of alluvial plains, and in areas with cobbly colluvium derived from upslope alluvial deposits. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well and moderately well drained; saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the A horizon and Bt horizons and moderately low in the lower argillic (2Btss). Saturated hydraulic conductivity of the duripan is very low to low.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for livestock grazing. Vegetation is soft chess, mouse barley, annual ryegrass, filaree, and other annual grasses and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Foothills of California; MLRA 18. The series is not extensive.
