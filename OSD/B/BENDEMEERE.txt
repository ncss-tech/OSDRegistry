BENDEMEERE SERIES

The Bendemeere series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium derived from granite, micaceous schist and gneiss on slightly convex toeslopes, mountain slopes and footslopes. Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual air temperature is 38 degrees F.

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bendemeere very gravelly sandy loam, on a northerly facing slope, convex, 24 percent slopes in a lodgepole pine-subalpine fir forest at an elevation of 8360 feet.  (Colors are dry unless noted otherwise).  When pedon was described soil pedon was moist to 47 inches, June 1990.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Clear Creek County, CO, Georgetown soil survey area, 2000.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  The zone is from 10 to 40 inches.
Other features:  Mica 30 to 48 by grain count.
Lamellae total thickness is greater than 6 inches(15 cm.) within upper 80 inches.
The assignment of the paramicaceous and is determined from laboratory data of this pedon S90CO019-002
Name of series derived from small community along Bear Creek in Clear Creek County, Colorado.
Taxonomic Version:  Eighth Edition, 1998

The mineralogy class was changed from paramicaceous to micaceous in 07/2010 by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the responsible MLRA regional office.  The change was necessary based on the eleventh edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2010.
