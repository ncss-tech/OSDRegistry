BARABOO SERIES

The Baraboo series consists of moderately well drained soils that are moderately deep to a lithic contact with quartzite. These soils formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of loess over hard, quartzite bedrock. These soils are on high structural benches, ridgetops, and convex side slopes on uplands in the Baraboo Range. Slope ranges from 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 860 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Oxyaquic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Baraboo silt loam, on a northeast-facing, convex slope of 3 percent, in an abandoned field, at an elevation of about 358 meters above sea level.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Ap--0 to 13 centimeters; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; friable; common fine fibrous roots; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. 

   Bt1--13 to 36 centimeters; brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; firm; common fine fibrous roots; common very fine pores; few distinct discontinuous clay films on faces of peds and in pores; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.  

   Bt2--36 to 48 centimeters; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silty clay loam; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; firm; common fine fibrous roots; many very fine and few fine pores; few distinct discontinuous clay films and dark coats on faces of peds and in pores; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.

   Bt4--71 to 86 centimeters; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam; weak thick platy structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; firm; few fine fibrous roots; common fine pores; few distinct patchy clay films on faces of peds and in pores; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation in the matrix; about 5 percent angular quartzite gravel and 9 percent cobbles; strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary.

Oxyaquic subgroup based on zone of saturation within 100 centimeters for 20 or more consecutive days or 30 or more cumulative days during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of 30 year mean of annual precipitation.

The Baraboo Range is a monadnock.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
