BAVDARK SERIES

The Bavdark series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from gneiss and schist. These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, hills, mountain slopes, and drainageways. Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Pachic Argicryolls  

TYPICAL PEDON: Bavdark coarse sandy loam, in rangeland (Colors are for dry unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 25 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) coarse sandy loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; many very fine and common fine and medium pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate permeability to a depth of 107 cm and moderately rapid below.

USE AND VEGETATION: Bavdark soils are used mainly for rangeland and wildlife habitat. Potential native vegetation may include Idaho fescue, Richardson needlegrass, Columbia needlegrass, mountain brome, lupine, and sticky geranium.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Bavdark soils are moderately extensive in central and southwestern Montana. MLRA 43B.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Gallatin County, Montana, 1997.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - from 0 to 107 cm (A, AB, Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Argillic horizon - from 46 to 107 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Particle size control section - from 46 to 96 cm (Bt1 and part of Bt2 horizons)

Bavdark soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.

Horizon designation for the AB horizon and similarity between this soil and the competing Odark series needs to be investigated across the extent of the series.
