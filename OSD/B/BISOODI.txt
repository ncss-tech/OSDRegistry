BISOODI SERIES

The Bisoodi series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from calcareous sandstone and limestone.  Bisoodi soils are on broad undulating plateaus with slopes of 1 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 52 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Ustic Haplocalcids 

TYPICAL PEDON: Bisoodi fine sandy loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 1 inch; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) fine sandy loam, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; weak thin platy structure parting to single grain; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common fine vesicular pores; 5 percent gravel and 5 percent channers; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 4 inches thick)

    A2--1 to 4 inches; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) loam, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel and 5 percent channers; strongly effervescent, 11 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick)

    Bk1--4 to 10 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/4) gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 5 percent calcium carbonate coated gravel and 5 percent coated channers; violently effervescent, 17 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary. (4 to 7 inches thick)

    Bk2--10 to 14 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; weakly calcium carbonate cemented; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine tubular pores; 10 percent calcium carbonate coated channers; violently effervescent, 17 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick)

    2Cr--14 to 18 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) weathered, calcareous sandstone; discontinuous thin calcium carbonate coatings on the undersides of channers and in joints; many very fine roots matted in between channers and in joints; abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 15 inches thick)

    3R--18 inches; sandstone capped by a thin discontinuous layer of calcium carbonate.

TYPE LOCATION: Navajo County, Arizona; about 16 miles southwest of Holbrook just west of AZ-377; about 900 feet west and 300 feet north of the southeast corner of section 10, T. 15 N., R. 19 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July-September and December-February.  Driest during May and June.  Ustic aridic soil moisture regime.

Soil Temperature - 52 to 57 degrees F.

Organic matter - 0.5 to 2.0 percent in upper 6 inches

Depth to bedrock - 6 to 20 inches but dominantly 15 to 20 inches

Depth to calcic horizon: 1 to 8 inches (15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent)

Rock fragments: 1 to 20 percent gravel and channers, but averages less than 15 percent above the paralithic contact

A horizon
Hue:  5YR, 7.5YR
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma:  3, 4 or 5, dry or moist
Clay content: 5 to 18 percent clay
Reaction:  slightly to moderately alkaline

Bk horizon
Hue:  5YR, 7.5YR
Value:  5, 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist
Chroma:  3, 4 or 6, dry or moist

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bisoodi soils are on broad undulating plateaus with slopes of 1 to 20 percent.  Elevations range from 4800 to 6000 feet.  They formed in alluvium derived dominantly from calcareous sandstone and limestone.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 to 14 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 130 to 165 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cerrillos and Epikom soils.  Cerrillos soils do not have a lithic contact.  Epikom soils have a cambic horizon and do not have a paralithic contact.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation includes galleta, black grama, blue grama, sideoats grama, alkali sacaton, Indian ricegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, needleandthread, broom snakeweed, rabbitbrush, Bigelow sagebrush, and a few widely spaced oneseed juniper, and pinyon.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Arizona.  The series is moderately extensive. MLRA 35.
