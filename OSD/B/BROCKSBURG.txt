BROCKSBURG SERIES

The Brocksburg series consists of very deep, well drained moderately permeable soils formed in loamy sediments over sand or gravelly sands.  These soils are on uplands and stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Pachic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Brocksburg loam - on a 0.6 percent convex southeast facing slope in rangeland.  When described the soil was moist throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

   A--0 to 15 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.  (12 to 20 inches thick)

   Bt1--15 to 21 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; very hard, firm; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.

   Bt2--21 to 27 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; very hard, firm; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 8 to 16 inches.)

   BC--27 to 30 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium and coarse subangular blocky; hard, friable; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 12 inches thick)

   2C--30 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly coarse sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; loose, neutral.

TYPE LOCATION:  Keya Paha County, Nebraska; 2 miles south and 3 1/4 miles east of Springview; 1300 feet east and 65 feet south of the northwest corner of Sec. 33, T. 33 N., R. 20 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to sand or gravelly sands ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 34 inches in thickness.  Typically carbonates are leached below a depth of 60 inches.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is loam and ranges from sandy loam to silt loam.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.

The Bt1 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The texture is loam to clay loam with clay content ranging from 18 to 33 percent.  The Bt2 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 and textures similar to the Bt1.  Reaction in the Bt horizon is neutral or slightly alkaline.

The BC horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 through 7 and 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  The BC horizon ranges from silt loam to gravelly loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.

The 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 through 7 and 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It contains from 8 to 45 percent gravel by volume.  It is sand, coarse sand or gravelly coarse sand.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  Brocksburg is the only series in the family. Similar series in other families are Jansen and Oneill.  Jansen and Oneill soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick.  Oneill soils lack argillic horizons and have less clay in the subsoil.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Brocksburg soils are on uplands and stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The soils formed in loamy sediments over sand or gravelly sands.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 24 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Hord, Jansen, Meadin and Oneill soils.  Hord soils lack argillic horizons and are not underlain by sand or gravelly sands.  Jansen and Oneill soils are on similar landscapes.  Meadin soils are less than 20 inches thick over gravelly sands and contain more than 35 percent gravel in the particle size control section.  They are on steeper hill slopes and ridge tops.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Surface runoff is low.  Permeability is moderate in the Bt horizon and very rapid in the underlying sand or gravelly sands.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of these soils are cultivated.  Corn, wheat, and alfalfa are the major crops.  Some areas are irrigated.  Big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, prairie sandreed, and blue grama are the dominant native grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central South Dakota and north-central Nebraska.  The series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Boyd County, Nebraska, 1976.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 27 inches (A, Bt1 and Bt2 horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from 15 to 27 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).
