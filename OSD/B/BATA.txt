BATA SERIES 

The Bata series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over glacial till and colluvium.  Bata soils are on moraines in glaciated valleys and on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Andic Glossocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bata gravelly ashy silt loam, forested.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; undecomposed and slightly decomposed forest litter. 

    Bw--2 to 11 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) gravelly ashy silt loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine and medium granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine through coarse roots; many fine pores; 15 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary.  (7 to 11 inches thick) 

    2E/Bt--11 to 22 inches; E part (70 percent) is pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) gravelly loam, pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) moist interfingering into B part; B part (30 percent) is pink (7.5YR 7/4) gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; texture mixed is gravelly loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and medium roots; many fine pores; 30 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.7); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 18 inches thick) 

    2Bt1--22 to 38 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/4) very gravelly clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; common fine pores; few distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 40 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary. 

    2Bt2--38 to 60 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very gravelly clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; common fine pores; continuous prominent clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 35 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderately slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Bata soils are used for timber production, as wildlife habitat, and for watersheds.  The native vegetation is subalpine fir, western larch, Douglas-fir, Engelmann spruce, and lodgepole pine with an understory of queencup beadlily, twinflower, blue huckleberry, rusty menziesia, common beargrass, and grouse whortleberry.
