BOILER SERIES

The Boiler series consists of deep, well drained soils on
forested mountains.  They formed in colluvium from
tuffaceous sediments.  Slopes are 35 to 60 percent.  The
mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches, and the mean
annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, frigid Ultic Palexerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Boiler gravelly loam - on a 55 percent
convex northeast-facing slope, woodland.  (Colors are for
moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

O--1 inch to 0; partially decomposed litter layer of
twigs, needles, and leaves.

A1--0 to 6 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2)
gravelly loam, grayish brown (10YR5/2) dry; weak very fine
granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky
and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and few medium
roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 25 percent
gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear
smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)

A2--6 to 13 inches; dark brown (10YR3/3) very gravelly
clay loam, brown (10YR5/3) dry; moderate very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable,
slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and
fine and few medium roots; many very fine and fine random
tubular pores; 40 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles;
neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (7 to 12 inches
thick)

2Bt1--13 to 25 inches; brown (10YR4/3) extremely
gravelly silty clay, brown (10YR5/3) dry; moderate fine and
medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and
plastic; common fine and few medium roots; common very fine
and fine tubular pores; common moderately thick clay films
on ped faces and lining pores; 60 percent gravel; neutral
(pH 6.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (10 to 25 inches thick)

3Bt2--25 to 49 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR4/4)
extremely gravelly clay, yellowish brown (10YR5/4) dry;
strong medium prismatic structure; very hard, very firm,
very sticky and very plastic; no roots; common very fine
tubular pores; many thick clay films on ped faces and lining
pores; 60 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH
6.8).  (0 to 25 inches thick)

4Cr--49 inches; weathered sediments.

TYPE LOCATION:  Baker County, Oregon; NE1/4NE1/4SW1/4NE1/4
of sec. 25, T. 11 S., R. 36 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature
ranges from 42 to 47 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist
but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 80 consecutive days during the summer.  Depth to a paralithic
contact is greater than 40 inches.  Depth to the 2Bt horizon
is 10 to 20 inches.  Coarse fragments range from 35 to 70
percent in the control section.  Thickness of the mollic
epipedon is 10 to 20 inches.  The solum ranges from slightly
acid to neutral.

The A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry,
and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.  It has 15 to 25 percent
gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles or stones.

The 2Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and
chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is silty clay or clay,
averaging 50 to 60 percent clay.  It has 40 to 60 percent
gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  It has moderate or
strong angular or subangular blocky structure, and in some
pedons grades into moderate or strong prismatic.

The 3Bt horizon, when present, has colors and percent rock
fragments similar to the 2Bt horizon.  The structure is
coarse angular blocky or medium to coarse prismatic.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Hudspeth and Player series.  Hudspeth soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock and are
mapped on adjacent south slopes.  Player soils are more than
60 inches deep to bedrock and are usually dry for more than
90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Boiler soils are on side slopes of
forested mountains.  Slopes are 35 to 60 percent.
Elevations range from 4,000 to 5,000 feet.  The soils formed
in colluvium from tuffaceous sediments.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 30 inches.  The mean annual
temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is
30 to 50 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Derringer,
Hankins, Harlow, Morningstar and the competing Hudspeth
soils.  Derringer and Hudspeth soils are 20 to 40 inches
deep to bedrock and are clayey-skeletal.  Hankins and
Morningstar soils are greater than 40 inches deep to
bedrock.  Hankins soils are non-skeletal.  Morningstar soils
are loamy-skeletal.  Harlow soils are 10 to 20 inches deep
to a lithic contact.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is rapid.  Permeability is slow.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for timber production.  The vegetation is mainly ponderosa pine,
Douglas fir, common snowberry, wax currant, spirea,
serviceberry, elk sedge, pinegrass, some Idaho fescue,
heartleaf arnica and wild strawberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mountainous areas of eastern
Oregon.  The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Baker County Area, Oregon; 1988.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon
are:

Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a
depth of approximately 13 inches (A horizon).

Argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 13 to 49
inches (2Bt1, 3Bt2 horizons).

"Pale" feature - argillic horizon with clayey particle-size
class and abrupt upper boundary (2Bt1 horizon).

Ultic feature - base saturation of between 60 and 75 percent
either throughout the entire argillic horizon or in the
upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon, whichever is
thinner.
