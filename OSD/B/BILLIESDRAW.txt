BILLIESDRAW SERIES

The Billiesdraw series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rock. These soils are on outwash terraces and fan remnants. Slopes are 1 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 350 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 2.0 degrees C.
