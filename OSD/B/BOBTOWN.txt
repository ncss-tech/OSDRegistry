BOBTOWN SERIES

The Bobtown series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits on uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1067 mm (42 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (53 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Aquultic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Bobtown loamy fine sand, on a nearly level, convex slope in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

[13 to 28 cm (5 to 11 inches) thick]

 EB--33 to 51 cm (13 to 20 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) fine sandy loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few very fine roots; common fine brown (10YR 4/3) iron stains; few fine prominent black (N 2.5/) masses of iron-manganese; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. [0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 inches) thick]

 Bt1--51 to 74 cm (20 to 29 inches); strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) fine sandy loam; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; firm; few very fine roots; common distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay films on faces of peds; few fine prominent black (N 2.5/) masses of iron-manganese; common fine prominent light gray (10YR 7/2) iron depletions; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

 Bt2--74 to 96 cm (29 to 38 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy clay loam; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; firm; few very fine roots; common distinct pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay films on faces of peds; common medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron; few fine prominent black (N 2.5/) masses of iron-manganese; many medium distinct light gray (10YR 7/2) and few medium distinct gray (10YR 6/1) iron depletions; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary. 

 Bt3--96 to 132 cm (38 to 52 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; very friable; few very fine roots; clay bridging between sand grains; many medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron; common fine prominent black (N 2.5/) and strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) masses of iron-manganese; many coarse faint light gray (10YR 7/2) iron depletions; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 43 to 99 cm (17 to 39 inches).]

 BC--132 to 155 cm (52 to 61 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy sand; massive; very friable; many fine prominent black (N 2.5/) masses of iron-manganese; many medium faint light gray (10YR 7/2) iron depletions; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary. [10 to 33 cm (4 to 13 inches) thick]

 C--155 to 203 cm (6l to 80 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) stratified loamy sand, loamy fine sand, and fine sand; massive; very friable; common medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; many coarse distinct light gray (10YR 7/2) and common medium faint pale brown (10YR 6/3) iron depletions; strongly acid.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Coshocton and Sycoline series. Coshocton soils contain more than 2 percent rock fragments of shale, siltstone, or sandstone within the series control section. Sycoline soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bobtown soils are on nearly level to gently sloping uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The soils formed in eolian deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1118 mm (40 to 44 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 11 to 13 degrees C (52 to 55 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alvin, Ayrshire, Bloomfield, Lyles, and Princeton soils. The somewhat poorly drained Ayrshire soils and the very poorly drained Lyles soils are in lower lying positions. The well drained Alvin and Princeton soils and the somewhat excessive drained Bloomfield soils are on higher lying convex slopes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 15 cm to 61 cm (0.5 to 2.0 feet) between December and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to very high. Permeability is moderate to rapid. Available water capacity is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Bobtown soils are cultivated. Corn and soybeans are the principal crops. A few areas are used for hay and pasture. Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods with oaks, elm, maple, and tulip poplar as the major species.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 114A in south-central Indiana. This series is of small extent.
