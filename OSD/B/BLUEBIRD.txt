BLUEBIRD SERIES

The Bluebird series consists of very deep, well drained soils on fan terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium from granitic rock.  Slopes range from 1 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Bluebird very gravelly sandy clay loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium platy parting to moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 40 percent gravel; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick)

    Bt--3 to 18 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) extremely gravelly sandy clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 60 percent gravel; many faint clay films on ped faces and lining pores; discontinuous pockets of strongly effervescent secondary calcium carbonate in a noneffervescent matrix; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 20 inches thick)

    2Bw--18 to 44 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) extremely gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and medium roots; few very fine irregular pores; 65 percent gravel; very slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (ph 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (10 to 26 inches thick)

    2Btkb--44 to 60 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) very gravelly sandy clay loam, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist; moderately fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 55 percent gravel; many thin clay films on ped faces and lining pores; calcium carbonate coatings on undersides of gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

TYPE LOCATION: Hualapai Valley, Mohave County, Arizona; Latitude of 35 degrees, 45 minutes, 24 seconds north, and longitude of about 114 degrees, 11 minutes, 54 seconds west.  About 700 feet east and 2,400 feet south of the northwest corner of section 3, T. 27 N., R. 18 W. Gila and Salt River Base Meridian.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ashmed (NV), Bitter (CA), Blind (AZ), Highland (NV)(T), Khyber (CA), Nellake (CA), Soledad (NM), Timosea (CA), Topawa (AZ), Twobitter (CA), and Werewolf (CA) series.  Ashmed soils have an argillic horizon with a SAR of 13 to 35.  Bitter soils have loamy sand or sand textures immediately below the argillic horizon.  Blind soils are noneffervescent throughout and the base of the argillic horizon extends to 60 inches.  Highland soils are less than 40 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Khyber soils are dominated by 2 to 5 millimeter gravel and contain 1 to 15 percent durinodes in the subsoil.  Nellake soils average less than 20 percent clay in the argillic horizon and less than 15 percent clay in the subsoil.  Soledad soils average less than 19 percent clay in the argillic horizon and are moist in the soil moisture control section for more than 20 days in the summer.  Timosea soils are dry in the soil moisture control section from May to December and are moist in some or all parts for 40 to 60 consecutive days during March to May.  Topawa soils are moist in the soil moisture control section for more than 20 days in the summer.  Twobitter and Werewolf soils average less than 18 percent clay in the control section.  In addition, Twobitter soils have accumulations of gypsum in the argillic horizon and have sandy textured subsoils.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bluebird soils are on fan terraces at elevations of 2,840 to 5,000 feet.  Slopes range from 1 to 45 percent.  These soils formed in granitic alluvium.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 200 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Detrital, Arizo, Lostman, Azure, Antares and Hulda soils.  Arizo soils are sandy-skeletal.  Detrital soils do not have argillic horizons.  Lostman soils are coarse-loamy.  Azure, Hulda and Antares soils have bedrock at depths less than 20 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing, recreation and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation includes Joshua tree, flattop buckwheat, creosotebush, and range ratany.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Arizona.  Bluebird soils are of moderate extent.  MLRA is 30.
