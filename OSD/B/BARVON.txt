BARVON SERIES 

The Barvon series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from weakly consolidated interbedded sandy and silty sedimentary beds and semiconsolidated shale.  These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Entic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Barvon loam, woodland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted) 

    Oi--0 to 0.5 inch; pine needles, grass, twigs and leaves. 

    Oe--0.5 to 0.75 inch; decomposed pine needles, grasses and leaves mixed with mineral soil (Combined O horizons 0 to 2 inches thick) 

    A1--0.75 to 4.75 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many krotovinas; soil mass noncalcareous, but some pebbles lime-coated on lower sides; less than 1 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. 

    A2--4.75 to 14.75 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) and brown (10YR 5/3) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine and common fine tubular pores; many large krotovinas; few fine masses of lime; slightly effervescent; some pebbles lime coated on lower sides; less than 1 percent pebbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.  (Combined A horizons 7 to 16 inches thick) 

    Bk1--14.75 to 24.75 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) light clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few very fine and medium roots; common fine and medium tubular pores; many large krotovinas; strongly effervescent; common seams and threads of segregated lime; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. 

    Bk2--24.75 to 34.75 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) clay loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common fine and medium tubular pores; strongly effervescent; common seams and threads of segregated lime; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. (Combined Bk horizons 12 to 24 inches thick)

    Cr1--34.75 to 42.75 inches; light gray (5Y 7/2) weakly consolidated sandy sedimentary beds, light olive gray (5Y 6/2) moist; few very fine roots along fracture planes; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear boundary. 

    Cr2--42.75 to 60 inches; stratified weakly consolidated silty sedimentary beds and semi-consolidated shale.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are the Coulterg, Mavreeso and Rottulee series. 
Coulterg:  do not have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.
Mavreeso: have hue of 7.5YR or redder.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 

Landform - sedimentary plains and hills. 

Elevation - 2,300 to 4,500 feet. 

Slope - 2 to 70 percent. 

Parent material - residuum derived from weakly consolidated sandy and silty sedimentary beds and semiconsolidated shale. 

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm summers. 

Mean annual precipitation - 12 to 20 inches. 

Mean annual air temperature - 40 to 45 degrees F. 

Frost-free period - 100 to 135 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arnegard, Bitton, Cabba, Campspass, Farland, Lamedeer and Ringling soils.  Arnegard soils occur at the base of slopes or in beds of drainage valleys and have a mollic epipedon 20 inches or more thick.  Bitton and Lamedeer sils have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section and lack a Cr horizon.  Cabba soils lack a mollic epipedon and have weakly consolidated sedimentary beds at depths of less than 20 inches.  Campspass soils have an argillic horizon with more than 35 percent clay.  Farland soils lack a Cr horizon and have an argillic horizon.  Ringling soils have fragmental material at depths of less than 20 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Barvon soils are used mainly for woodland. Potential native vegetation is mainly ponderosa pine with a canopy cover of 30 to 50 percent.  The understory is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, common snowberry, common chokecherry and Oregon-grape. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Barvon soils are of moderate extent in southeastern Montana.
