10/2018--The type location of the Bucketlake OSD was moved from Baker County to the location in the Wallowa County TUD. The Baker County version of the series was not used in published data; it only existed in the OSD. The version in the Wallowa County TUD was published in several soil surveys of the Blue Mountains and in the Wallowa County soil survey.
