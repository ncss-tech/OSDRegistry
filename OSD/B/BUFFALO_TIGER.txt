COMPETING SERIES: These are the Keylargo and Loxahatche soils. 
Keylargo soils--have bedrock at depths greater than 203 centimeters (80 inches), are subject to daily flooding by marine water, are dominated by mangroves, and occur in the tidal zone of the Florida Keys.
Loxahatche soils--lack bedrock at depths less than 203 centimeters (80 inches) and occur on similar landform positions. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landscape: Florida Everglades
Landform(s): Rises, talfs, and/or dip positions in brackish marshes and swamps Parent material: organic materials formed from remains of hydrophytic herbaceous plant overlying limestone bedrock. 
Mean annual air temperature: 24 to 26 degrees C (75 to 79 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 1,118 to 1,600 millimeters (44 to 63 inches) 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: In addition to the competing Loxahatche soils, these are:
Coopertown soils--have limestone bedrock within 18 to 50 centimeters (7 to 20 inches) of the surface and occur in similar landform positions.
Gator Lake soils--have limestone bedrock within 5 to 18 centimeters (2 to 7 inches) of the surface and occur in similar landform positions.
Macks Camp soils--have bedrock at depths of 100 to less than 150 centimeters (40 to 59 inches) and occur on similar landform positions. 
Plantation soils--have sandy layers below the organic layer and above the limestone bedrock.
Shark Valley soils--have bedrock at depths of 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) and are in similar landform positions.
Tamiami soils--have subsurface horizons of freshwater marl that compose less than 1/2 the thickness of the control section and occur in similar landform positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class: Very poorly drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat): Very high to high 
Permeability: Rapid 
Surface runoff: Negligible
Flooding frequency and duration: None
Ponding frequency and duration: Under natural conditions the soil is covered by water (ponded)-very frequently for very long duration (9 to 11 months), currently ponding is controlled by anthropogenic activities.

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Major Uses: Water quality, water storage, and wildlife habitat. 
Dominant vegetation: sawgrass, sedges, lilies, spikerush, willow, elderberry, pond apple, and cypress. 

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Florida Everglades and associated areas.  This series is of moderate extent

SERIES PROPOSED: Miami-Dade County, Florida; 2018.

REMARKS: Classification was revised from Lithic Haplosaprists to Typic Haplosaprists (March, 2021).

Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:

   1. Particle-size control section: 0 to 130 centimeters (0 to 51 inches)
   2. Histic epipedon: 0 to 79 centimeters (0 to 31 inches), (Oa1, Oa2 and Oa3 horizons)
   3. Lithic contact: 152 centimeters (60 inches) (2R horizon)
   4. Peraquic conditions - Endosaturation ranges from 0 to 203 centimeters (0 to 80 inches)

This soil was previously mapped as Terra Ceia, limestone substratum, which is in the hyperthermic temperature regime.
