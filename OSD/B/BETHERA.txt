SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Distribution: Alabama, Florida, North Carolina, and South Carolina. 
Extent: Extensive

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Berkeley County, South Carolina; l974

REMARKS: 
The Bethera series was formerly included in the Coxville series.  Clay mineralogy data indicated Bethera soils have mixed mineralogy.

The September 2025 revision reformatted the description to semi-tabular.  No data was changed.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 18 centimeters (7 inches) (A1, A2, and E horizons).
Argillic horizon--the zone from 18 to 173 centimeters (7 to 68 inches) (Beg, Btg1, and Btg2 horizons).
Aquic conditions--endosaturation from the surface as indicated by matrix colors showing iron depletion, as well as areas of iron accumulation in the argillic horizon.
