BRANHAM SERIES

The Branham series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from granite and granitic gneiss.  These soils are on hills, ridges and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Branham coarse sandy loam, grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A1--0 to 2 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) coarse sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; 10 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); abrupt smooth boundary.

    A2--2 to 4 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) coarse sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; many very fine pores; 10 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the A1, A2 horizons - 4 to 11 inches)

    Bw--4 to 22 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; many very fine and fine pores; few thin clay films bridging sand grains; 25 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.1); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 20 inches thick)

    BC--22 to 30 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) and very pale brown (10YR 8/2), dry or moist gravelly coarse sand; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; 30 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 14 inches thick)

    R--30 inches; granite bedrock.
