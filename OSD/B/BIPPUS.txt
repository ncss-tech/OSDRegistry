BIPPUS SERIES

The Bippus series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium of Holocene age. These nearly level and very gently sloping soils are on narrow ephemeral streams of draws. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 483 mm (19 in), and mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Cumulic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Bippus clay loam, on flood plain of draw, slightly concave 1 percent slope in cropland at an elevation of about 987 meters (3,240 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

bundleflower, engelmann daisy, prairie clovers, hackberry, elm, and wild plum. 
Widely spaced mesquite and cacti are in some places. This soil has been
