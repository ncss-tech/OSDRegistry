BRAGG SERIES

The Bragg series consists of well drained, moderately slowly to slowly permeable modified soil materials.  The soils formed from cutting and filling operations in the Coastal Plain.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, acid, thermic Typic Udorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bragg sandy loam. (Colors are for moist soil.)

     Ap--0 to 6 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) sandy loam; massive; friable; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

     C1--6 to 20 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/8), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), and light gray (10YR 6/1) sandy clay loam, massive; firm, slightly sticky; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 24 inches thick)

     C2--20 to 30 inches; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8) sandy clay loam; common medium light gray (N 7/0) clay bodies and strata; massive; firm, slightly sticky; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 20 inches thick)

     C3--30 to 40 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy clay; common medium distinct red (2.5YR 5/8) mottles; massive; firm, slightly sticky; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 15 inches thick)

     C4--40 to 49 inches; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8) sandy clay loam with common medium distinct light gray (N 7/0) clay bodies; massive; friable; slightly sticky; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 15 inches thick)

     C5--49 to 56 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) sandy clay loam; common medium distinct brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) mottles; massive; firm; slightly sticky; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

     C6--56 to 72 inches; light red (2.5YR 6/8) sandy clay; common medium distinct reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8) mottles; massive; firm, slightly sticky; common fine bodies of clay; strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 20 inches thick)

     A1b--72 to 76 inches; very dark gray (N 3/0) loamy sand; weak fine granular structure; very friable; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 7 inches thick)

     A2b--76 to 80 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) loamy sand; weak fine granular structure; very friable; strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Cumberland County, North Carolina; Fort Bragg Military Reservation; 2 miles northwest from intersection of Macridge Road and Plank Road, 500 feet west of Macridge Road near center of range no.42.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the fill material ranges from 20 to more than 80 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to strongly acid except where the surface has been limed.  Coarse fragments of quartz and ironstone range from 0 to 3 percent by volume in all horizons.

The Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8.  It is loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  Mottles in shades of yellow or brown are present in some pedons.

The C horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8 or it has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, chroma of 2 to 8.  Soil colors are generally contrasting from layer to layer.  Low chroma colors are not indicative of wetness but a condition of the original soil.  The C horizon is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or sandy clay.  The 10- to 40-inch control section averages from 18 to 35 percent clay.  Underlying horizons are variable in colors and texture.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bragg soils are on constructed landscape segments in the Carolina Sandhills and the Upper, Middle, and Lower Coastal Plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent.  The soil formed from materials that have been cut and filled and graded or smoothed for firing ranges, recreational areas, earthen runways, and adjacent areas.  The mean annual temperature is 63 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 48 inches near the type location.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Blaney, Blanton, Dothan, Fuquay, Gilead, Lakeland, Lucy, Norfolk, Orangeburg, and Vaucluse series.  Except for Lakeland, all of these soils have argillic horizons.  Lakeland soils are sandy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderately slowly to slowly permeable.  Perched water can be expected between layers of the filled soil for short periods of time.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of the acreage is used for firing ranges, recreational areas, airports, and disturbed areas around urban development.  Annual and perennial grasses and legumes are used for stabilization.  Some areas have very sparse vegetation. Very few to no native trees are left.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The Coastal Plain area of North Carolina and perhaps South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and Alabama.  The series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Cumberland County, North Carolina; 1981.

REMARKS:  These soils were formerly placed in miscellaneous land types as cut and fill land and/or made land.
