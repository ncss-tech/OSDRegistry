BACID SERIES

The Bacid series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and alluvium.  Bacid soils are on plains, fans, terraces and hills.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.   Mean annual precipitation is about 30 centimeters (12 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Ustic Haplargids
