BOMBER SERIES

The Bomber series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in siliceous alluvium over gypsiferous coarse-loamy eolian deposits. These nearly level soils are on drainageways on fan piedmonts. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bomber soils are on drainages on fan piedmonts and receive additional run on moisture. Slope is 0 to 3 percent. These soils formed from clayey alluvium over coarse-loamy gypsiferous eolian deposits. Elevation ranges from 3,970 to 4,280 ft. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. Precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September. The mean annual air temperature is 62 to 70 degrees F. The frost-free period is 200 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Corvus, Matador, Nasa, Tornado and Yesum soils. Corvus soils have petrogypsic horizons between 5 and 20 inches and are on relict dunes and fan piedmonts. Matador soils have salic horizons and are in similar positions. Tornado soils are greater than 40 percent clay in the particle size control section, have mixed mineralogy and are in drainages. Nasa soils have a petrogypsic horizon between 20 and 40 inches and are on fan piedmonts. Yesum soils have a gypsic horizon within 7 inches from the surface (Leptic) and are on fan piedmonts.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderate to moderately rapid.  Runoff is low. The soil is flooded occasionally for very brief periods following intense thunderstorms. 

USE AND VEGETATION: The major uses are military activities and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is alkali sacaton, tobosa, vine mesquite, fourwing salt bush with scattered iodine bush. Bomber soils have very high production due to run on moisture. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South central New Mexico, limited to the Tularosa Basin and surrounding piedmonts. MLRA 42-2. Limited extent.
