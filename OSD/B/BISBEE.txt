BISBEE SERIES

The Bisbee series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian and outwash material from acidic igneous rocks. Bisbee soils are on dune-like terraces and have slopes of 0 to 65 percent slopes. The mean annual precipitation is about 475 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7.8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, mesic Typic Xeropsamments

TYPICAL PEDON: Bisbee loamy fine sand, grazed woodland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    O--0 to 1 cm; undecomposed needles, twigs, bark; abrupt smooth boundary. (0.5 to 3 cm thick)

    A--1 to 11 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loamy fine sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 23 cm thick)

    C1--11 to 24 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy fine sand, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; single grained; loose; few fine roots; few fine faint iron stains on sand particles; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary. (13 to 38 cm thick)

    C2--24 to 72 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) loamy fine sand, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; single grained; loose; few fine roots; few fine faint iron stains on sand particles; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual wavy boundary. (38 to 51 cm thick)

    C3--72 to 152 cm; variegated fine sand; single grained; loose; few roots; neutral (pH 6.6).

TYPE LOCATION: Ferry County, Washington; 805 meters east and 400 meters south of the NW corner sec. 17, T. 36 N., R. 37 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Mean annual soil temperature - ranges from 8.3 to 11.1 degrees C. Mesic temperature regime. 
Soil Moisture - usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 30 and 89 cm for 75 to 90 days following summer solstice. Xeric moisture regime.
Particle size control section - dominantly fine sand, 0 to 15 percent coarse sand and very coarse sand, and 0 to 10 percent gravel  

Note: Some pedons have a thin E horizon.

A horizon:
Value - 2 or 3 dry, 5 or 6 moist
Chroma - 2 or 3 dry or moist
Clay content - 3 to 8 percent
Rock fragments - 0 to 6 percent gravel
Reaction - 6.2 to 6.8

C horizons:
Hue - 10YR or 2.5Y
Value - 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist 
Chroma - 2 to 4 dry or moist
Textures - loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand or sand
Clay content - 3 to 8 percent
Rock fragments - 0 to 14 percent gravel
Reaction - 6.4 to 6.8

COMPETING SERIES: 
Chimney (CA) - have 15 to 30 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section
Coneward (CA) - have an argillic horizon
Dart (WA) - have 15 to 50 percent coarse sand and very coarse sand in the particle-size control section 
Ewall (WA) - are dry for 90 to 105 days in the moisture control section
Panamaker (WA) - have 15 to 30 percent volcanic glass and glass aggregates
Preston (UT) - do not have an O horizon 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landforms - dune-like terraces
Elevations - 390 to 1,035 meters
Slopes - 0 to 65 percent
Parent material - formed in eolian and outwash material from acidic igneous rocks
Climate - continental
Mean annual precipitation - 375 to 500 mm
Mean annual air temperature - 7.2 to 10.0 degrees C.  
Frost-free season - 100 to 140 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Battleplain, Hodgson, Phoebe, Scala, and Springdale soils and the competing Dart soils. Battleplain soils have a mollic epipedon. Hodgson soils have a fine-textured argillic horizon. Phoebe soils are coarse-loamy and have a mollic epipedon. Scala soils are coarse-loamy. Springdale soils are a sandy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat excessively drained; high saturated hydraulic conductivity in the upper part and very high in the lower part.

USE AND VEGETATION: Grazed woodland. Some areas are used for dryland crops or orchards. The native vegetation on drier sites is ponderosa pine, needlegrass, pinegrass, and kinnikinnick; on more moist sites: it is ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, ceanothus, kinnikinnick, pinegrass, rose, serviceberry, moss, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass and yarrow.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern Washington. Bisbee series is of moderate extent. MLRA - 43A.
