BOONEVILLE SERIES

The Booneville series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from basalt and welded tuff.  Booneville soils are on concave backslopes and footslopes of mountains and foothills.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 30 inches and the average annual air temperature is 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Pachic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Booneville loam -- on a north-facing concave slope of 25 percent under mixed subalpine fir and Douglas-fir woodland, at 6,790 feet elevation.  (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise stated.  When described on September 19, l978, the soil was moist throughout under 2 inches of snow.)

    Oe--0 to 2 inches; partly decomposed needles and twigs. (1/2 to 2 inches thick)

    A1--2 to 7 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; few fine and common medium roots; few fine and very fine vesicular and interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 5 inches thick)

    A2--7 to 16 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine and medium granular; soft, very friable; common fine, medium, and coarse roots; few fine and very fine vesicular pores; 15 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, 3 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.1); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 20 inches thick)

    Bt1--16 to 32 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very cobbly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few medium and common coarse roots; few very fine, fine and medium tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds and rock fragments; 15 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles, 15 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.3); gradual wavy boundary. (16 to 30 inches thick)

    Bt2--32 to 60 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely cobbly clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few medium roots; few fine and medium tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds and rock fragments; 20 percent gravel, 35 percent cobbles, 20 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.3).

Elevation - 5,200 to 8,800 feet in Idaho and Montana; up to 10,800 feet in Colorado
Slope - 5 to 65 percent
Parent material - slope alluvium and colluvium derived from basalt and welded tuff
Climate - cold and moist in winter and warm and dry in summer
Mean annual precipitation - 22 to 32 inches in Idaho and Montana (most of which is snow); in Colorado the precipitation ranges to 45 inches
Mean annual air temperature - 33 to 39 degrees F
Frost-free period - 30 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dehana (T), Southmount (T), and the competing Parkay series.  Dehana and Southmount soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section. These are on similar landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Booneville soils are used mainly for woodland and wildlife habitat.  The dominant natural vegetation is Douglas fir, subalpine fir, mountain snowberry, Oregon grape, and elk sedge.  Quaking aspen is a common seral species.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Booneville soils are of small extent in southwestern and eastern Idaho and west central Colorado. MLRAs 25, 43B and 48A.
