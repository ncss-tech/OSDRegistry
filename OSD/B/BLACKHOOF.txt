BLACKHOOF SERIES

The Blackhoof series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in a thin layer of organic materials atop a friable mantle of loamy, glaciolacustrine or glaciofluvial deposit and the underlying firm loamy till on moraines, till plains and lake washed till plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C. and mean annual precipitation is about 710 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, nonacid, frigid Histic Humaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Blackhoof mucky peat on a concave slope of less than 1 percent on a moraine in a pasture. Elevation of about 410 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Bg--38 to 43 centimeters; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) Fe concentrations; 2 percent gravel; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary. (2 to 62 centimeters thick)

    2Bw1--43 to 58 centimeters; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; common medium prominent yellowish red (5YR 5/8) Fe concentrations; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

    2Bw3--107 to 152 centimeters; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; common medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) Fe concentrations; firm; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the 2Bw horizons is 27 to 175 centimeters)

    2C--152 to 203 centimeters; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) loam; massive; firm; 8 percent gravel; neutral.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--thin layer of organic materials atop a friable mantle of loamy glaciolacustrine or glaciofluvial deposit and the underlying firm loamy till

Slope--0 to 1 percent
Mean annual air temperature--3 to 5 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation--500 to 762 millimeters

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Near the type location, these are the Duluth, Culver, Dusler, Ellsburg, and Baden soils.  None of these associated soils have a histic epipedon.
Duluth--are on higher and more sloping landscape positions and are in the Haplic Glossudalfs subgroup
Culver--are on higher and more sloping landscape positions and are in the Oxyaquic Glossudalfs subgroup
Dusler--are on higher landscape positions and are in the Aquic Glossudalfs subgroup
Ellsburg--are on slightly higher lying landscapes and are in the Typic Glossaqualfs subgroup
Baden--are on similar landscape positions and are in the Typic Endoaquepts subgroup

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage class--very poorly drained--these soils are frequently saturated at the surface during the spring and fall in normal years
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--1.00 to 10.00 micrometers per second (moderately high) in the loamy glaciolacustrine or glaciofluvial deposit and 0.10 to 1.00 micrometers per second (moderately low) in the underlying till
Ponding--following periods of heavy rainfall

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are undrained. A few areas are in pasture. Native vegetation consists mostly of reeds, sedges and grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Physiographic Divisions--Interior Plains or Laurentian Upland
Physiographic Provinces--Central Lowland or Superior Upland
Physiographic sections--Western Lake section (if in the Central Lowland Province) or undefined (if in the Superior Upland Province)
MLRAs--Northern Minnesota Glacial Lake Basins (88), Wisconsin and Minnesota Thin Loess and Till, Northern Part (90A), Superior Lake Plain (92), and Superior Stony and Rocky Loamy Plains and Hills, Western Part (93A)
LRR K; Northeastern Minnesota.
Extent--moderate

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Carlton County, Minnesota, 1973.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters
Series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
histic epipedon--the zone from the surface to 30 centimeters (Oe horizon);
cambic horizon--the zone from 38 to 152 centimeters (Bg, 2Bw1, 2Bw2 and 2Bw3 horizons);
aquic moisture regime base on histic epipedon and low chroma colors in the Bg horizon.  Reddish colors of the parent material in 2Bw and 2C horizons mask the low chroma of Fe depletions.  A positive reaction to alpha-alpha-dipyridyl is assumed. 2/11/2011-TYPE LOCATION error was corrected.
