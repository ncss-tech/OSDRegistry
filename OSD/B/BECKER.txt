BECKER SERIES

The Becker series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of postglacial alluvial sediments and in the underlying sandy and gravelly sediments. These soils are on slightly concave to slightly convex slopes on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 780 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Pachic Hapludolls

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon-the zone from the surface to a depth of 76 centimeters (Ap, A1, A2, and AB horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 76 to 91 centimeters (2Bw horizon);
udic moisture regime.

Pachic subgroup based on less than 0.3 percent organic carbon at a depth of 125 centimeters and a regular decrease in organic-carbon content from a depth of 25 to 125 centimeters.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
