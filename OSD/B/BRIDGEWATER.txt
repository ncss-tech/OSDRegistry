05/2016--The Bridgewater series was used in an update project of some riparian areas southeast of Pendleton in Umatilla County, Oregon. The soils in this project area support ponderosa pine, have sandy loam in the 2C horizon, and are in a 600 to 650 mm precipitation zone. These concepts are outside the range in characteristics for the Bridgewater series; thus, they are not recognized in this official series description. A new series should be considered for areas that support ponderosa pine and have fine subsurface textures.

6/2016--This official series description was updated according to SSR1 Technical Note 11--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015).
