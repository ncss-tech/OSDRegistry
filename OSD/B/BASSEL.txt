SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Park County, Colorado, Teller-Park soil survey area, Colorado, 2010. The Bassel series name was reactivated in 2009 for use in the Teller-Park soil survey. The name is coined. This series was originally established in 1959 in Chaffee County, Colorado. In the Trout Creek Watershed Area, which is now a part of the soil survey of Pike and San Isabel National Forests, Northern Part.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 137 cm.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 56 cm.  (the whole argillic horizon)
Mollic epipedon:  from 0 to 23 cm.  (A, Bt1 horizons)
Argillic horizon:  from 10 to 56 cm.  (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons)
Secondary carbonates: from 56 to 112 cm. (Bk1, Bk2 horizons)
Paralithic contact:  The contact with conglomerate at 112 cm.  (Cr layer)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
