BRICKNER SERIES 

The Brickner series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from hard sedimentary or fine grained igneous rock. These soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Haplustalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Brickner gravelly sandy clay loam, stony, forested (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 0.5 inches; partially decomposed needles, twigs, and leaves. (0 to 2 inches thick)

    A--0.5 to 3 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly sandy clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 25 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick)

    Bt--3 to 8 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) very gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine, and few medium roots; common very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; common faint brown (10YR 4/3) clay films on faces of peds and bridging sand grains; 5 percent cobbles and 35 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0). (3 to 12 inches thick)

    BC--8 to 12 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine and few medium roots; 15 percent cobbles and 55 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 4 inches thick)

    R--12 inches; hard fractured sandstone.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Brickner soils are primarily used for timber production, wildlife habitat, and understory grazing. The potential native vegetation is mainly Douglas fir, limber pine, Rocky Mountain juniper, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, big sagebrush, and rubber rabbitbrush.
