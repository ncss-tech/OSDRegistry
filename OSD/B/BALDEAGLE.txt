BALDEAGLE SERIES

The Baldeagle series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountains.  They formed in material weathered from granite and gneiss bedrock with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and moderately rapid to rapid below.  Slope ranges from 35 to 75 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 50 inches.

(8 to 16 inches thick)

    2C--36 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) extremely stony sandy loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine irregular pores; 15 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, and 50 percent stones; strongly acid (pH 5.4).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Katka and Redraven series. Katka soils are dry 30 to 45 consecutive days in the moisture control section. Redraven soils have 2Bw horizons.
 
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Baldeagle soils are on north-facing mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 35 to 75 percent.  They formed in residuum derived from granite and gneiss bedrock with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  Elevations range from 4,800 to 6,000 feet.  The climate is cold, with cool moist summers and cold wet winters.  The average annual air temperature is 38 to 42 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is 45 to 60 inches.  The average frost-free period is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Jaypeak (T), Katka (T), Pend Oreille, and Redraven series.  Jaypeak soils are on north-facing mountain slopes at lower elevations and are frigid.  Katka soils are on south-facing mountain slopes and are dry for 30 to 45 days in the moisture control section.  Pend Oreille soils are on north-facing mountain slopes at lower elevations and are frigid and ashy over loamy.  Redraven soils are on north-facing mountain slopes and formed in glacial till and lack strongly acid 2C horizons.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; permeability is moderate in the upper part and moderately rapid to rapid below.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed.  Potential natural vegetation is mainly subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, western larch, and Douglas-fir with an understory of rustyleaf menziesia, queencup beadlily, myrtle pachystima, heartleaf arnica, dampwoods blueberry, darkwoods violet, Utah honeysuckle, western wintergreen, big blueberry, western rattlesnake plantain, western meadowrue, common beargrass, common princes pine, and Columbia brome.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Idaho, and possibly northwestern Montana and northeastern Washington.  This series is not extensive.
