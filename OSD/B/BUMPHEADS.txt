BUMPHEADS SERIES

The Bumpheads series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from basalt or tuff.  Bumpheads soils are on plateaus.  Slopes are 1 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, smectitic, frigid Pachic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bumpheads very stony loam--on an 8 percent slope at an elevation of 5,200 feet--forestland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  The soil was dry throughout when it was described on October 6, 1998.)  The soil surface is partially covered with about 15 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones.

(8 to 16 inches thick)

    Crt--34 to 38 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4), weathered basalt, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; common faint clay films on pararock fragments.  (1 to 8 inches thick)

    R--38 inches; hard, unweathered basalt.

TYPE LOCATION:  Klamath County, Oregon; about 2 miles southeast of Antler Point, 1.3 miles east of the Main Haul Road, and 0.5 mile east of the cinder pit at the end of the side road; 1,600 feet north and 500 feet east of the southwest corner of section 3, T. 41 S., R. 15 E.; USGS Antler Point 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; 42 degrees 2 minutes 20 seconds north latitude and 120 degrees 56 minutes 6 seconds west longitude, NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Usually moist in winter and spring, dry in summer and fall; xeric moisture regime that borders on aridic.

Mean annual soil temperature - 45 to 47 degrees F.

Mean summer soil temperature - 59 to 61 degrees F.

Mollic epipedon thickness - 20 to 26 inches, includes the Bt1 horizon.

Argillic horizon thickness - 12 to 24 inches.

Depth to base of argillic horizon - 24 to 40 inches.

Depth to bedrock - 24 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact.  The paralithic material below the contact is weathered basalt or tuff.  Hard, unweathered bedrock is typically within 60 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Arcia, Arva, Broadhead, Cristo, Henefer, Rugar, Schnipps (T), and Sweitberg series.

Arcia and Sweitberg soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Arva, Rugar, and Schnipps soils are deep to paralithic contacts.  Broadhead and Henefer soils are very deep.  Cristo soils have limestone rock fragments in the particle-size control section, calcareous C horizons with 1 to 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent, and paralithic material of shale within the series control section.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bumpheads soils are on plateaus.  They typically occur on summit positions.  These soils formed in residuum derived from basalt or tuff.  Slopes are 1 to 10 percent.  Elevations range from 4,800 to 5,200 feet.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 17 to 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F., mean January temperature is 25 to 28 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is 56 to 60 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Mound and Norcross soils.  Mound soils are clayey-skeletal, deep to paralithic contacts, and have argillic horizons and thick mollic epipedons.  Norcross soils are clayey, shallow to thin duripans over bedrock, and have mollic epipedons and argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; high surface runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Bumpheads soils are used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  The native vegetation is a forest canopy of western juniper and ponderosa pine with an understory of Idaho fescue, mountain big sagebrush, and curlleaf mountainmahogany.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Oregon.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 21.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California.
