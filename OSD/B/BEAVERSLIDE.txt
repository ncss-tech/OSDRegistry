BEAVERSLIDE SERIES 

The Beaverslide series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium on stream terraces, fan remnants, alluvial fans and depressions. These soils are subject to prolonged saturation from flood irrigation. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.

Climate - long, cold winters; cool, moist springs; short, cool summers
Mean annual precipitation - 14 to 19 inches
Mean annual air temperature - 34 to 40 degrees F. 
Frost-free period - 30 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Mooseflat, Shewag and Wisdom soils.  The Mooseflat soils are very poorly drained and are on floodplains and drainageways.  Shewag soils are sandy-skeletal and are on outwash plains. Wisdom soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and are on outwash plains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Beaverslide soils are used for irrigated grass hay and irrigated pasture.  The vegetation is mainly Garrison creeping foxtail, meadow foxtail, timothy, tufted hairgrass, and other miscellaneous sedges, rushes and forbs.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Beaverslide soils are not extensive in the intermountain valleys of southwestern Montana. MLRA 44B.
