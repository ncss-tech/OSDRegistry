BURGRAFF SERIES

The Burgraff series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from soft sedimentary bedrock.  These soils are on sedimentary plains.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Burgraff silt loam, in grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A1--0 to 3 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.

    A2--3 to 6 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (Combined A horizons 5 to 8 inches thick)

    Bk1--6 to 17 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) silt loam, pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 5 percent soft angular pebbles of siltstone; many fine and medium seams of lime; continuous faint coatings of lime on faces of peds; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick)

    Bk2--17 to 27 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 20 percent small, soft, angular pebbles of siltstone; common fine and medium seams of lime; continuous faint coatings of lime on faces of peds; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth boundary. (Combined Bk horizons 16 and 35 inches thick)

    Cr--27 to 60 inches; gray (5Y 6/l) fractured semiconsolidated siltstone; few fine roots in fractures in upper part, strongly effervescent.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - sedimentary plains.
Elevation - 3,500 to 4,500 feet.
Slope - 0 to 35 percent.
Parent material - silty material weathered from soft sedimentary bedrock.
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm summers.
Mean annual precipitation - 12 to 14 inches.
Mean annual temperature - 40 to 45 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 105 to 120 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Burgraff soils are used mainly for rangeland and dryland crops.  Potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, needleandthread, western wheatgrass, prairie junegrass, Sandberg bluegrass, and plains muhly.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Burgraff soils are of small extent.  They occur mainly in west-central Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lewis and Clark County Area, Montana, 1991; proposed in Lewis and Clark County, Montana, 1987.  

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretation Record:  MT1103.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches (A1, A2, and Bk1); a calcic horizon from 6 to 27 inches (Bk1, Bk2 horizons); a paralithic contact at a depth of 27 inches.  Burgraff soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
