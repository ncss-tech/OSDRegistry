BERNARD SERIES

The Bernard series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in clayey fluviomarine deposits of the Beaumont Formation.  These soils are on flats on flat coastal plains.    Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1143 mm (45 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 20.6 degrees C (69 degrees F).

Faddin soils:  have a loamier surface 
Labelle soils:  are located in areas with a higher rainfall
Dacosta soils:  occur in drier areas and have sandy clay loam surfaces 
Spindletop soils:  are not vertic , occur on mounds and have a loamier surface

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: clayey fluviomarine deposits derived from igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rock
Landscape:  flat coastal plains

Slope: 0 to 1 percent, but areas bordering narrow natural drains range to 5 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 1,092 to 1,245 mm (43 to 49 in)
Mean annual air temperature: 20 to 22 degrees C (68 to 72 degrees F)
Frost-free period:  270 to 300
Elevation:  3 to 30.5 m (10 to 100 ft)
Thornthwaite P-E Index: 54 to 75

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Addicks, Clodine,Edna, Lake Charles, Verland series.  
Addicks and Clodine soils: have coarse-loamy control sections.  
Edna soils:  do not have a mollic epipedon   
Lake Charles soils:  are vertisols and are clayey to the surface
Verland soils:  do not have a mollic epipedon

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; runoff is high;  very slow permeability.  The soil is saturated within 0.6 m (2 ft) of the surface during the winter and early spring.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for growing corn, cotton, grain sorghums, and rice.  A few areas are in improved pastures of bermudagrass, bahiagrass, and dallisgrass.  Native vegetation is tall prairie grasses, mainly andropogons and paspalums, and a few widely spaced elm and huisache trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Coastal Prairie of Texas and Louisiana.  MLRA150A.  The series is extensive, the estimated area is about 500,000 acres.
