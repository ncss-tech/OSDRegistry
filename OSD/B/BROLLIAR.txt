BROLLIAR SERIES

The Brolliar series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from basalt.  Brolliar soils are on hillslopes and have slopes of l to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 2l inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 1/4 F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Typic Argiustolls

(Both lab pedons are classified in a Vertic subgroup) (One is Paleustolls)

TYPICAL PEDON: Brolliar very stony loam-forested.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 1 inch; decomposed and partially decomposed pine needles.

    Al--1 to 3 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) very stony loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate thin platy structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.  (1 to 5 inches thick)

    A2--3 to 6 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) stony heavy loam, very dark brown (7.5YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium platy structure; soft, friable, sticky and plastic; common fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick)

    B--6 to 11 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; moderate thin subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common fine and medium roots; few fine pores; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.

    Bt1--11 to 21 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; strong fine angular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common fine and medium roots; many fine pores; few thin clay films on faces of peds and in pores; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 27 inches thick)

    Bt2--21 to 35 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) clay, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; extremely hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine, medium and coarse roots; few fine pores; common thin clay films on faces of peds; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt irregular boundary.  (10 to 30 inches thick)

    R--35 to 37 inches; hard fractured basalt.

TYPE LOCATION: Coconino County, Arizona; one mile northwest of Stoneman Lake Road, in the NWl/4SEl/4 sec. l2, T. l6 N., R. 8 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Depth to bedrock: 20 to 40 inches

Mean annual soil temperature: 47 1/4 to 50 1/4 F.

Mean summer temperature: 59 1/4 to 64 1/4 F.

Soil moisture: Intermittently moist in some parts of the moisture control section during July-September and December-February. Driest during May and June. Typic ustic moisture regime.

Most pedons have fine dark concretions (iron and manganese oxides) throughout.

A horizons
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: loam, silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam
Coarse fragments: 5 to 40 percent
Reaction: moderately acid to slightly alkaline.

Bt horizons
Hue: 5YR to 2.5YR
Value: 3 to 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: clay, silty clay, or clay loam
Clay content: greater than 35 percent
Reaction: neutral to slightly acid
Some pedons have small slickensides in the lower solum.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Beadle (SD), Carlson (KS), Harney (KS), McClure (SD), Mento (KS), Raber (SD), Reliance (SD) and Spearville (KS) series. All these soils are on the Great Plains (LRR-G or LRR-H) and are more moist in May and June.
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Brolliar soils are on hillslopes underlain by basalt at elevations ranging from 6,500 to 7,600 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is l8 to 24 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 45 1/4 F.  The average January temperature is about 26 1/4 F., and the average July temperature is about 64 1/4 F.  The frost-free season is 75 to l00 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Siesta and Sponseller series.  Siesta soils lack a mollic epipedon and do not have a lithic contact within 40 inches.  The particle size control section in Sponseller is commonly l8 to 27 percent clay.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained.  Slow to medium runoff.  Slow and very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for woodland, water supply, wildlife, and for summer grazing.  Native vegetation is ponderosa pine, Gambel oak, and an understory of Arizona fescue, mountain muhly, bottlebrush squirreltail, and Junegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Arizona and New Mexico.  The series is of moderate extent. MLRA 39.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Beaver Creek Area, Arizona; l965.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from 1 to 6 inches (A horizons)

Argillic horizon - The zone from 11 to 35 inches (Bt horizons)

Lithic contact - The boundary at 35 inches (R horizon)

Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Ninth Edition, 2003

These soils have an O horizon, but it is too thin and discontinuous to be considered in classification.
