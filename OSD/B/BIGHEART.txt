BIGHEART SERIES

The Bigheart series consists of shallow, well drained to somewhat excessively drained soils formed in material weathered from sandstone of Pennsylvanian age. Bigheart soils are on crests and upper side slopes of cuestas and hillslopes, in the North Cross Timbers (MLRA 84A). Slopes range from 1 to 45 percent. At the type location, mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (60 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 970 mm (38 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, siliceous, active, thermic Lithic Eutrudepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Bigheart fine sandy loam in an oak forest with understory of native grasses, at an elevation of 300 m (985 ft). (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

  A--0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 in); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) crushed, fine sandy loam; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; friable, slightly hard; many fine, common medium, and common coarse roots throughout; many fine and common very fine pores; 5 percent worm casts throughout; moderately acid, pH 5.7, Hellige-Truog; clear wavy boundary. (Thickness of the A horizon is 5 to 15 cm [2 to 6 in])

  Bw1--13 to 28 cm (5 to 11 in); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) broken face, fine sandy loam; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard; many fine, common medium roots, and common coarse roots throughout; common very fine pores; 5 percent worm casts throughout; moderately acid, pH 6.0, Hellige-Truog; clear wavy boundary.

  Bw2--28 to 38 cm (11 to 15 in); strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) broken face, fine sandy loam; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable slightly hard; common fine roots, common medium roots, and few coarse roots throughout; common fine and very fine pores; 5 percent worm casts throughout; 5 percent sandstone gravel; moderately acid, pH 6.0, Hellige-Truog; abrupt irregular boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bw horizon is 15 to 38 cm [6 to 15 in])

  R--38 to 48 cm (15 to 19 in); strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) strongly-cemented sandstone; very rigid, extremely hard.

TYPE LOCATION: Osage County, Oklahoma; about 14 miles northeast of Pawhuska; about 2,350 feet south and 1,100 feet east of the northwest corner of sec. 23, T. 27 N., R. 10 E.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These soils are the Bartlesville, Niotaze, Prue, and Steedman series. 
Bartlesville soils: are fine-loamy and occur on more gently sloping crests
