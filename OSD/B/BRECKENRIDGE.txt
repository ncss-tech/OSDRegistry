BRECKENRIDGE SERIES

The Breckenridge series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils formed in glaciofluvial deposits overlying loamy till on lake plains and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, semiactive, nonacid, frigid Mollic Endoaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Breckenridge sandy loam, on a 1 percent slope in a cultivated area. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 20 cm (8 inches); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; friable; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [15 to 23 cm (6 to 9 inches) thick]

 Bg1--20 to 41 cm (8 to 16 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. [0 to 20 cm (8 inches) thick]

 Bg2--41 to 61 cm (16 to 24 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) masses of oxidized iron; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. [20 to 71 cm (8 to 28 inches) thick]

 Bg3--61 to 76 cm (24 to 30 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sandy loam; massive; friable; common fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) masses of oxidized iron; slightly acid. [0 to 30 cm (12 inches) thick]

 2Cg--76 to 152 cm (30 to 60 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clay loam; massive; firm; many fine distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) masses of oxidized iron; 5 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Gladwin County, Michigan; 1240 feet east and 910 feet north of the southwest corner of sec. 24, T. 19 N., R. 1 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Reaction: moderately acid to slightly alkaline 

Bg horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 1 or 2

2Cg horizon:
Hue: 10YR to 5Y
Value: 5 or 6
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: loam, silt loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, or silty clay loam
Rock fragment content: 0 to 5 percent

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Tonkey series. Tonkey soils have stratification in the lower part of the series control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Breckenridge soils are on lake plains and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in glaciofluvial deposits overlying loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 660 to 813 mm (26 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 5.6 to 7.2 degrees C (42 to 45 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Belding, Brevort, Pinconning, Sims, and Ubly soils. Breckenridge soils are in a drainage sequence with the somewhat poorly drained Belding soils and the well drained and moderately well drained Ubly soils. The sandy Brevort and Pinconning soils and the clayey Sims soils are poorly drained associates in similar landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained or very poorly drained. Potential for surface runoff is very low to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the solum and moderately high in the substratum. Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the solum, and moderately slow in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: A large part is cropped to small grains, legume-grass, hay and beans; corn and vegetables are minor crops. The remainder is in forest or permanent pasture. Native vegetation is chiefly American elm, white ash, red maple, and some northern white-cedar.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 94A, 96, and 98 in central and northern Michigan. This series is of moderate extent.

Cambic horizon: from a depth of 20 to 76 cm (8 to 30 inches) (Bg1, Bg2 and Bg3 horizons).
Lithologic discontinuity: from fine sandy loam glaciofluvial deposits to clay loam till at 76 cm (30 inches).
Aquic conditions: redoximorphic features present in all horizons below the ochric epipedon.
