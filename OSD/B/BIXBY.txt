BIXBY SERIES

The Bixby series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in 50 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) of loamy sediments over sandy and gravelly alluvium or outwash.  The Bixby soils are on treads and risers on stream terraces, outwash plains, and valley trains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (about 48 degrees F).  Mean annual precipitation is about 775 millimeters (30 inches).

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Dodge County, Minnesota, 1959.

REMARKS: 
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 36 to 100 centimeters (14 to 39 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 and 2C horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (0 to 59 inches) (Ap, E, BE, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 and 2C horizons). 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 36 centimeters (14 inches) (Ap, E, and BE horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 36 to 76 centimeters (14 to 30 inches) (Bt1, Bt2 and Bt3 horizons);
an abrupt change in texture at 76 centimeters (30 inches);
udic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

The type location was moved from Dodge County, Minnesota to Fayette County, Iowa as laboratory data (NSSL) from the site in Dodge County, Minnesota did not support the series concept.
