BEJE SERIES

The Beje series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium or eolian deposits over residuum derived from sandstone. These soils are on ridges, structural benches, cuestas, mesas, hills and mountain slopes. Slopes are from 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 457 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Beje loam in rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  

    A--0 to 15 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine, fine, and medium pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 15 cm thick)

    Bt--15 to 36 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots; common very fine and fine pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (15 to 46 cm thick)

    R--36 cm; sandstone bedrock.

Elevation - 2072 to 2957 meters
Slopes - 0 to 50 percent
Parent material - slope alluvium, colluvium or eolian deposits over residuum derived from sandstone
Mean annual temperature - 3.3 to 7.2
Mean annual precipitation - 406 to 559 mm
Frost-free period - 70 to 120 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Comodore, Rottulee, Senchert and Trag series.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: well drained; moderate to moderately slow permeability 

USE AND VEGETATION: Beje soils are used for rangeland and pinyon-juniper woodland. Native vegetation is twoneedle pinyon, Utah juniper, mountain big sagebrush, saline wildrye, bluebunch wheatgrass and snowberry. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Beje soils are extensive in south-central Utah and southwest Colorado. MLRA 34B, 36, 47, 48A.
