BETHANY SERIES

The Bethany series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess or alluvium of Pleistocene age over shale of Permian age.  These soils are on summits and backslopes of paleoterraces in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA-80A).  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 865 mm (34 in).
