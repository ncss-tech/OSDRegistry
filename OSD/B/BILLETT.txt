BILLETT SERIES

The Billett series consists of very deep, well drained and moderately well drained soils formed in water-deposited or wind-deposited loamy or sandy sediments.  These soils are on nearly level to moderately steep convex crests and side slopes on outwash plains, stream terraces, or hills that border river valleys.  Slope ranges from 0 to 20 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 885 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Mollic Hapludalfs

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Lawrence County, Illinois, 1952.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 33 to 83 centimeters (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (Ap, E, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, C1 and C2 horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 33 centimeters (Ap and E horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 33 to 119 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Mollic subgroup based on colors and thickness of the ochric epipedon.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
