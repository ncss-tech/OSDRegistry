BOWERY SERIES 

The Bowery series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans, flood-plain steps, swales, stream terraces, hills, and escarpments.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Haplustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bowery loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A1--0 to 7 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary. 

    A2--7 to 24 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine roots; common very fine pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary. (combined thickness of A horizons is 16 to 35 inches) 

    Bw1--24 to 44 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine pores; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary. (5 to 25 inches thick) 

    Bw2--44 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine pores; 5 percent cobbles, 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8).
