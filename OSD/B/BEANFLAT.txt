BEANFLAT SERIES

The Beanflat series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess.  Beanflat soils are on broad alluvial flats.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid Aeric Halaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Beanflat silt loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 13 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; moderate thick platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine vesicular pores; strongly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (13 to 25 cm thick)

    C1--13 to 41 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common medium, fine, and very fine roots; common fine and very fine interstitial pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); gradual smooth boundary.  (23 to 28 cm thick)

    C2--41 to 56 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common medium, fine, and very fine roots; common fine and very fine interstitial pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual smooth boundary (15 to 36 cm thick)

    C3--56 to 102 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine interstitial pores; common coarse faint dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) masses of iron accumulation; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (20 to 46 cm thick)

    C4--102 to 112 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; few very fine interstitial and few fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 10 cm thick)

    C5--112 to 152 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) sandy loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine interstitial pores; many medium distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) moist masses of iron accumulation; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Eureka County, Nevada; about 20 miles northwest of Eureka in Kobeh Valley; approximately 1,260 feet east and 660 feet north of the southwest corner of section 10, T. 20 N., R. 50 E.; USGS Bartine Ranch 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 37 minutes 12 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 20 minutes 7 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.6200000 latitude, -116.3363889 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture; Saturated within a depth of 100 cm at some time between December and May.
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.
Reaction: Strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline surface, decreasing to moderately alkaline with depth.
Other features: Strongly salt and sodium-affected in the upper part of soil decreasing with depth.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  10 to 18 percent.A horizon

A horizon
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4.
Structure:  Platy or subangular blocky.

C horizons
Value:  5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4.
Texture:  Sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.
Rock fragments:  Up to 25 percent of some strata.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Beanflat soils are on broad alluvial flats.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed volcanic and sedimentary rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations are 1,830 to 1,985 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm mean annual temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brinnum and Dianev soils.  Brinnum soils have a fine-silty particle-size control section and mesic temperature regime.  Dianev soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control sections.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Beanflat soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly black greasewood, Douglas rabbitbrush, inland saltgrass, basin wildrye, and basin big sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 28B.
