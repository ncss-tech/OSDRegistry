DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage Class--Well drained

Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity Class--Moderately high except where compacted

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major uses--Used for residential, commercial, and recreational applications in an urban setting.
Vegetation-- Vegetation may include managed and unmanaged plant communities with a mix of native and non-native species. Many areas are vegetated with non-native ornamental landscaping and/or turfgrass associated with developed land uses. Some areas may exhibit weedy, invasive, and/or primary succession vegetation communities (e.g., abandoned lots and other unmanaged areas). Some small patches of mixed native forest species such as longleaf pine, shortleaf pine, and black locust may be present in undisturbed areas. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
General area--Urban and other areas with human-modified landscapes
Region--P - South Atlantic and Gulf Slope Cash Crops, Forest, and Livestock Region
Major Land Resource Area (MLRA)--136 - Southern Piedmont
