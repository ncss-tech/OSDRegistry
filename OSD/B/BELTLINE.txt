COMPETING SERIES:
These are the Barnwell, Cowarts, Marvyn, and Springhill soils. These series do not have a mantle of human-transported material.

Barnwell soils have densic contacts and a strongly to extremely acid reaction; occur on side slopes of interfluves in the Southern Coastal Plain
Cowarts soils have a strongly or very strongly acid reaction and have aquic conditions below 60 centimeters; occur on ridge tops and side slopes in the Southern Coastal Plain 
Marvyn soils have thinly stratified textures below the kandic with few to many mica flakes; occur on sideslopes in the Southern Coastal Plain
Springhill soils have a strongly to very strongly acid reaction; occur on ridgetops and sideslopes in the Southern Coastal Plain 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: Human-transported material over residuum 
Landform: Fills, raised land, or other locally raised landforms
Slope: 2 to 10 percent
Elevation: 40 to 110 meters
Frost-free period: 200 to 250 days
Mean annual air temperature: 13 to 17 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation: 1000 to 1200 millimeters

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Appling, Cecil, Chavis, Pacolet, Walcreek, and Wedowee soils. 

Appling soils have 35 to 60 precent clay in the particle-size control section; have few to many mica flakes throughout; found on nearby unmodified sideslopes and ridges 
Cecil soils have 35 to 60 precent clay in the particle-size control section and are dominantly 5YR or redder in the argillic horizons; found on nearby unmodified sideslopes and ridges
Chavis soils have greater than 50 centimeters of human-transported material; found on nearby cut and filled ridges and sideslopes
Pacolet soils have 35 to 60 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have few to common mica flakes in the argillic; found on nearby unmodified sideslopes and ridges 
Walcreek soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section; formed in fill from alluvium on nearby toeslopes 
Wedowee soils have 35 to 60 precent clay in the particle-size control section; found on nearby unmodified sideslopes and ridges 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage Class: Well drained 
Surface Runoff: Low
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity Class: Moderately high except where compacted
Flooding: None
Ponding: None

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major uses are for residential, commercial, and recreational applications in an urban setting. Vegetation may include managed and unmanaged plant communities with a mix of native and non-native species. Many areas are vegetated with non-native ornamental landscaping and/or turfgrass associated with developed land uses. Some areas may exhibit weedy, invasive, and/or primary succession vegetation communities (e.g., abandoned lots and other unmanaged areas). Some small patches of mixed native forest species such as sweetgum, yellow poplar, white oak, and loblolly pine may be present. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Urban and other areas with human-modified landscapes in the South Atlantic and Gulf Slope Cash Crops, Forest, and Livestock Region
Major Land Resource Area; MLRA 136. These soils are of small extent
