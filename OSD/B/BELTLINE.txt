COMPETING SERIES:
These are the Barnwell, Cowarts, Marvyn, and Springhill soils. These soils do not have a surface mantle of human-transported material.
Barnwell soils have densic contacts and a strongly to extremely acid reaction class.
Cowarts soils have a strongly or very strongly acid reaction and have aquic conditions below 60 centimeters. 
Marvyn soils have thinly stratified textures below the kandic with few to many mica flakes.
Springhill soils have a strongly to very strongly acid reaction. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: Human-transported material over residuum 
Landform: Fills, raised land, or other locally raised landforms on hillslopes

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are Appling, Cecil, Chavis, Pacolet, Walnut Creek, and Wedowee soils. 

Appling soils have 35 to 60 precent clay in the particle-size control section; have few to many mica flakes throughout; found on nearby sideslopes and ridges.
Cecil soils have 35 to 60 precent clay in the particle-size control section and are dominantly 5YR or redder in the argillic horizons; found on nearby sideslopes and ridges.
Chavis soils have greater than 50 centimeters of human-transported material; found on nearby cut and filled ridges and sideslopes.
Pacolet soils have 35 to 60 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have few to common mica flakes in the argillic; found on nearby sideslopes and ridges.
Walnut Creek soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section; formed in human-transported materials derived mostly from alluvium on nearby toeslopes and straddle drainageways.
Wedowee soils have 35 to 60 precent clay in the particle-size control section; found on nearby sideslopes and ridges.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage Class: Well drained 
Surface Runoff: Low
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity Class: Moderately high except where compacted
Flooding: None
Ponding: None

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major uses are for residential, commercial, and recreational applications in an urban setting. Vegetation may include managed and unmanaged plant communities with a mix of native and non-native species. Many areas are vegetated with non-native ornamental landscaping and/or turfgrass associated with developed land uses. Some areas may exhibit weedy, invasive, and/or primary succession vegetation communities (e.g., abandoned lots and other unmanaged areas). Some small patches of mixed native forest species such as sweetgum, yellow poplar, white oak, and loblolly pine may be present. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Urban and other areas with human-modified landscapes in the South Atlantic and Gulf Slope Cash Crops, Forest, and Livestock Region
Major Land Resource Area; MLRA 136. These soils are of moderate extent.
