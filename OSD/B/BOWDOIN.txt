BOWDOIN SERIES

The Bowdoin series consists of very deep, well drained clayey soils that formed in alluvium and glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Very-fine, smectitic, frigid Sodic Haplusterts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bowdoin clay, in native hayland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 6 inches; gray (5Y 5/1) clay, olive gray (5Y 4/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine roots; many very fine pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); abrupt wavy boundary. (2 to 7 inches thick)

    Bnss--6 to 34 inches; gray (5Y 5/1) clay, olive gray (5Y 4/2) moist; massive; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine roots; few very fine pores; cracks 1/2- to 1-inch wide that extend to 20 inches; few intersecting slickensides; few fine threads of gypsum in lower part; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); clear wavy boundary. (20 to 50 inches thick)

    Bny--34 to 60 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few to common fine threads and medium masses of gypsum; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - flood plains.

Elevation - 1,800 to 3,000 feet.

Slope - 0 to 2 percent.

Parent material - alluvium; glaciolacustrine deposits.

Climate - long, cold winters; warm summers.

Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 14 inches.

Mean annual temperature - 38 to 45 degrees F.

Frost-free period - 100 to 135 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Bowdoin soils are used mainly for native haylands of western wheatgrass; only a few small areas are used for irrigated cropland.  Potential native vegetation is mainly western wheatgrass, alkaligrass, squirreltail, greasewood, and big sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Bowdoin soils are extensive mainly in the Milk River and Missouri River valleys and their tributaries in northern Montana.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Milk River Area, Montana, 1928.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations records:  MT0005, MT0677.  Diagnostic features recognized in this pedon are:  open cracks and intersecting slickensides (Bnss horizon); a sodium adsorption ratio greater than 13 (Bnss, Bny horizons); an accumulation of gypsum (Bny horizon); and a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bnss, Bny horizons).   Bowdoin soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
