BODI SERIES

The Bodi series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy till.  These soils are on ground moraines.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and very slow in the lower solum and substratum.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches. Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: coarse-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Oxyaquic Fragiorthods

    3(B/E)x--30 to 44 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) sandy loam (Bt); occupies 70 percent of the horizon surrounded by reddish brown (5YR 5/3) loamy sand, pinkish gray (5YR 6/2) dry (E); weak coarse subangular blocky structure; very firm; common faint discontinuous reddish brown (5YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds and in pores;  common fine and medium vesicular and tubular pores; common medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) masses of iron accumulation; 2 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles and stones; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (combined thickness of 3(E/B)x and 3(B/E)x is 15 to 24 inches)

    3Cd--44 to 80 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) loamy sand; weak medium platy structure inherent from deposition; firm; 2 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles and stones; moderately acid. 

TYPE LOCATION: Luce County, Michigan; 1950 feet east and 1200 feet south of the northwest corner sec. 18, T.48N., R.8W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to the fragipan ranges from 18 to 26 inches. The particle size control section averages less than 5 percent clay.  The 3(E/B)x and 3(B/E)x horizons average 5 to 10 percent clay and between 50 and 70 percent fine sand or coarser. Gravel content ranges from 1 to 5 percent in the solum and 2 to 10 percent in the substratum.  Cobble and stone content ranges from 1 to 10 percent in the solum and 1 to 5 percent in the substratum.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in the solum and very strongly acid to moderately acid in the substratum.

The E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2.  It is very fine sandy loam or silt loam.

The Bhs horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is very fine sandy loam or silt loam.

The Bs1 and Bs2 horizons have hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 6.  They are very fine sandy loam or silt loam.

The 2Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and choma of 6.  It is sand or loamy sand.

The E part of the 3(E/B)x and the 3(B/E)x has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  The B part is 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4. It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.

The 3Cd horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sandy loam or loamy sand.  Along the margins of the ground moraine there can be thin layers of sand or loam in the lower substratum.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bodi soils are on ground moraines associated with the Munising Moraine.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 36 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 41 to 43 degrees F.  Elevations range from 800 to 850 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chesbrough (tentative), Kalkaska, and Markey soils.  The somewhat excessively drained Kalkaska soils are on slightly higher landscape positions.  The somewhat poorly drained Chesbrough soils are in slightly lower landscape positions.  The very poorly drained Markey soils are in depressions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. Permeability is moderate in the upper solum and very slow in the lower solum and substratum.  This soil has wet soil moisture status that is perched at a depth of about 18 inches below the surface during the months of October, November, March, April, and May.  Surface runoff is low.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of this soil are forested.  Common trees are sugar maple, American beech, red maple, big tooth aspen, yellow birch, balsam fir, white spruce, paper birch, and eastern hemlock.
 
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Upper Peninsula of Michigan.  This series is of small extent.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon are:particle size control section  the zone from 10 to 24 inches; Albic horizon - the zone from 1 to 4 inches (E horizon); Spodic horizon - the zone from 4 to 24 inches (Bhs, Bs and 2Bs horizons); oxyaquic subgroup - the soil is saturated with water from 18 to 44 inches for 1 month or more per year in 6 or more out of 10 years; Glossic horizon and fragipan - the zone from 24 to 44 inches (3(E/B)x and 3(B/E)x.  The base saturation of these horizons is less than 35 percent.
