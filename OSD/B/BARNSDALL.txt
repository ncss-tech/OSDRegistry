BARNSDALL SERIES

The Barnsdall soils have brown very fine sandy loam A horizons, reddish brown silty clay loam B2t horizons, reddish brown clay loam B3 horizon, and brown fine sandy loam IIC horizon.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, active, thermic Ultic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Barnsdall very fine sandy loam - tame pasture.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

  Ap--0 to 7 inches, (0 to 18cm); brown (10YR 4/3) very fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick)

  A2--7 to 11 inches, (18 to 28cm); brown (7.5YR 5/4) very fine sandy loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) dry; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick)

  B21t--11 to 29 inches, (28 to 74cm); reddish brown (5YR 4/4) silty clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) dry; moderate fine and medium   subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; nearly continuous clay films on faces of peds; brown coatings similar to the horizon above on faces of some peds; neutral; gradual smooth boundary. (13 to 20 inches thick)

  B22t--29 to 45 inches, (74 to 114cm); reddish brown (5YR 4/3) silty clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; nearly continuous clay films on faces of peds; brown coatings similar to the A2 horizon on faces of peds; few fine black concretions; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 19 inches thick)

  B3--45 to 58 inches, (114 to 147cm) reddish brown (5YR 4/3) clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/3) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; patchy clay films on faces of peds; few fine black concretions; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (12 to 30 inches thick)

  IIC--58 to 72 inches, (147 to 183cm) brown (7.5YR 4/4) fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) dry; massive; hard, friable; few fine black concretions; moderately acid.

TYPE LOCATION: Osage County, Oklahoma; about 7 miles east and 3 miles south of Hominy; about 1550 feet east and 750 feet north of the southwest corner of sec. 29, T. 22 N., R. 10 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.

The Ap or A1 horizon is very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), brown or dark brown (10YR 3/3, 4/3), or dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2).
The Ap, A1, and A2 horizons are mainly very fine sandy loam, but include loam or silt loam.
These horizons range from medium acid through neutral, except for the surface soils that have been limed.

The A2 horizon is brown or dark brown (10YR 5/3, 4/3; 7.5YR 5/2, 4/2, 5/4, 4/4).

The B2t horizon is reddish brown (5YR 4/3, 4/4), or yellowish red (5YR 4/6, 5/6). 
It is clay loam or silty clay loam.
It ranges from strongly acid through neutral.

The B3 horizon is brown (7.5YR 4/4), strong brown (7.5YR 4/6,
5/6), reddish brown (5YR 4/4), or yellowish red (5YR 4/6, 5/6).
It is loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam and strongly acid or
medium acid.

The IIC horizon is brown (7.5YR 4/4, 5/4) or strong brown (7.5YR 4/6).  Some pedons have light brown or pale brown mottles.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or clay loam and strongly acid or medium acid.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Armour, Dexter, Dossman, and Hicks series of the same family and the Askew, Atwood, Caspiana, Catoosa, Center, Deepwater, Karma, Lexington, Lula, Mason, Mer Rouge, Poindexter, Sterlington, Tiptonville, and Tutwiler series.  Armourand Hicks soils contain rock fragments.
Dexter and Dossman soils are moist for longer periods of time.  Askew and Center soils have wetness mottles.
Atwood and Lexington soils do not decrease in clay content within 60 inches of the soils surface.
Caspiana, Catoosa, Deepwater, Lula, Mason, Mer Rouge, and Tiptonville soils have mollic epipedons.
Dubbs and Memphis soils have Bt horizons with hues of 7.5YR or 10YR.
Gallion soils have more alkaline reactions in the
B3 and C horizons.
Karma and Poindexter soils have fine-loamy control sections.  Rilla soils have silt coatings in the major part of the B2t horizon.
Siwell soils have clayey IIBt and IIC horizons.
Sterlington and Tutwiler soils have coarse-silty
control sections.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Barnsdall soils occur on nearly level flood plains.
Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.
They have formed in loamy sediments.
The climate is moist subhumid to humid.
Thornthwaite annual P-E index is 60 to 78, average annual precipitation is about 36 to 44 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees to 65 degrees F.
They are rarely flooded for very brief periods during the months of February through October.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cleora, Mason, and Verdigris series.
Cleora, Mason, and Verdigris soils have mollic epipedons.
In addition, Cleora soils have coarse-loamy control section and Cleora and Verdigris soils lack argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained
slow runoff
moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for tame pasture.
Some areas are cultivated to small grains, grain sorghums, soybeans, and alfalfa.
Some areas used for native hay meadows or native range.
Native vegetation is mixed bottomland hardwoods with an understory of grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern Oklahoma and possibly southeastern Kansas. The series is of minor extent.
