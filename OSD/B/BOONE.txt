BOONE SERIES

The Boone series consists of excessively drained soils which are moderately deep to a paralithic contact with sandstone.  These soils formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of siliceous sandy residuum from the underlying sandstone and/or in siliceous sandy colluvium or slope alluvium.  These soils are on hills in bedrock controlled uplands.  Slope ranges from 1 to 90 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 775 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Bates County, Missouri, 1908. 

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
Series control section--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 150 centimeters

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 20 centimeters (Oe, A, and E horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 20 to 53 centimeters (Bw horizon); paralithic contact--the contact with sandstone bedrock at a depth of 89 centimeters;
siliceous feature--less than 10 percent weatherable minerals (.02 to 2 mm fraction) in the particle-size control section;
uncoated class--weighted average content of silt plus clay of 5 percent or less in the particle-size control section. 

The Type Location is associated with the Wonewoc formation. The Boone series concept could occur on any of the dominantly quartz Cambrian sandstone formations as well as the Ordovician St. Peter formation.
