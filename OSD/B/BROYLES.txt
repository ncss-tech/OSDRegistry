BROYLES SERIES

The Broyles series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a thin surficial mantle of loess and volcanic ash.  Broyles soils are on fan remnants, fan skirts, fan aprons, inset fans, beach plains, and alluvial flats. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Broyles soils are on fan aprons, fan remnants, inset fans, fan skirts, beach plains, and alluvial fans. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a thin mantle of loess and volcanic ash. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevations are 1,220 to 1,980 meters. The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Beoska, Beowawe, and Creemon soils. Beoska soils have a natric horizon. Beowawe soils have a fine-loamy natric horizon and weakly silica-cemented Bkq horizon. Creemon soils are coarse-silty. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Broyles soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly shadscale, bud sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, and Indian ricegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North-central Nevada. These soils are extensive with about 176,000 acres of the series mapped to date. The series concept and main acreage is in MLRA 24, while other acreage occurs in MLRA 28B.
