MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Surry County, North Carolina, 2003.

REMARKS: Bannertown soils were previously mapped as Ashlar soils. The 04/1997 relocation of the mesic/thermic line in North Carolina and Virginia necessitated the establishment of the Bannertown series as a mesic counterpart.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 8 inches (A and BA horizons)
Cambic horizon--the zone from 8 to 19 inches (Bw horizon)
Paralithic contact--the contact at a depth of 27 inches ( top of Cr layer)
Paralithic materials--the zone from 27 to 30 inches (Cr horizon)
Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 30 inches
