BERTRAM SERIES

The Bertram series consists of moderately deep, well drained and somewhat excessively drained soils formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of oxidized and leached sandy loam eolian material and in the underlying residuum from limestone.  These soils occur on convex summits of interfluves and side slopes on dissected till plains.  Slope ranges from 2 to 14 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 fegrees F).  Mean annual precipitation is about 890 millimeters (35 inches).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bertram sandy loam, on a north-facing slope of 6 percent, in a cultivated field.  (All colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

 Ap--0 to 20 centimeters (0 to 8 inches); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) sandy loam; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; very friable; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.

[Combined thickness of the A horizon is 25 to 50 centimeters (10 to 20 inches).]

 2C--86 to 91 centimeters (34 to 36 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) gravelly loamy sand; single grain; loose; about 20 percent hard limestone fragments 1 to 3 centimeters in diameter; slightly alkaline.  [0 to 10 centimeters (0 to 4 inches) thick]

 3R--91 centimeters (36 inches); hard limestone bedrock, moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Augusta Lake, Aureola, Bolan, Dickinson, Elrick, Etter, Filley, Gardencity, Olin, Ridgeport, Roine, Wadenill, and Zenor series.
None of these series have limestone bedrock within a depth of 100 centimeters (40 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) of oxidized and leached sandy loam eolian material and in the underlying residuum from limestone
Landform--convex summits of interfluves and convex side slopes on dissected till plains
Slope--2 to 14 percent
Elevation--175 to 300 meters (574 to 1148 feet) above sea level
Mean annual air temperature--7.8  to 9.4 degrees C (46 to 49 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation--735 to 940 millimeters (34 to 36 inches)
Frost-free period--165 to 205 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dickinson, Flagler, Marshan, and Rockton soils.
Dickinson--are on landscape positions similar to those of the Bertram soils and do not have limestone bedrock within a depth of 100 centimeters
Flagler--are on lower landscape positions on treads and risers on stream terraces and do not have limestone bedrock within a depth of 100 centimeters
Marshan--are on lower landscape positions in drainageways and have a frequently saturated zone within a depth of 0.3 meter when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Rockton--are on landscape positions similar to those of the Bertram soils and have a clay content that averages 24 to 35 percent in the particle-size control section

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--well drained and somewhat excessively drained--a saturated zone does not occur within a depth of 1.8 meters ( 6 feet) when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--10.00 to 100.00 micrometers per second in the eolian material and 1.00 to 10.00 micrometers per second in the residuum and underlying limestone bedrock

USE AND VEGETATION:
The gently sloping areas are commonly cultivated.  The principal crops are corn, soybeans, small grains, and legume hay.  The steeper slopes are pastured.  The native vegetation is big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, and other grasses of the tall grass prairie.

Physiographic Division--Interior Plains
Physiographic Province--Central Lowland
Physiographic section--Dissected till plains
MLRA--Eastern Iowa and Minnesota Till Prairies (104)

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Linn County, Iowa, 1970.

Remarks:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 91 centimeters (10 to 36 inches);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 91 centimeters (36 inches).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 43 centimeters (17 inches) (Ap and A horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 43 centimeters to 86 centimeters ( 17 to 34 inches) (Bw1, Bw2 and 2Bt horizons);
lithic contact--the contact with limestone bedrock at a depth of 91 centimeters (36 inches);
udic moisture regime.

The upper 0.3 to 1.5 meters (1 to 5 feet)of limestone may be significantly fractured and may not be a root restrictive layer.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
