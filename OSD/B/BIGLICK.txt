BIGLICK SERIES

The Biglick series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in drift and in the underlying residuum from limestone or dolostone. They are on monadnocks on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, illitic, mesic Lithic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Biglick loam, on a north-facing, convex, 1 percent slope in a cultivated field at an elevation of 256 meters (840 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; moderate fine and medium granular structure; friable; common fine and few medium roots; 2 percent igneous pebbles; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. [13 to 28 cm (5 to 11 inches) thick]

 2Bt--25 to 36 cm (10 to 14 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay; strong fine and medium subangular blocky structure; firm; common fine roots; many distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) clay films on faces of peds; 1 percent igneous pebbles in the upper part of the horizon, and 7 percent limestone fragments in the lower part; slightly alkaline; abrupt irregular boundary. [8 to 33 cm (3 to 13 inches) thick]

 2R--36 cm (14 inches); fractured limestone; extending to 27 inches are solution cavities and fractures that have filled with dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) fine sandy loam.

TYPE LOCATION: Hancock County, Ohio; about 2.75 miles northeast of Vanlue, in Biglick Township; about 620 feet east and 2,340 feet north of the southwest corner of sec. 36, T. 1 N., R. 12 E.; USGS Carey, Ohio topographic quadrangle; lat. 40 degrees 59 minutes 53 seconds N. and long. 83 degrees 26 minutes 13 seconds W., NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Thickness of the solum, depth to the base of the argillic horizon, and depth to a lithic contact (limestone or dolostone): typically 30 to 48 cm (12 to 19 inches), but ranges from 25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 inches)

Ap horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 3 or 4 (6 or more dry)
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: loam
Rock fragment content: 0 to 7 percent, mainly glacial erratics
Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline

Some pedons have a thin Bt horizon formed in till.

2Bt horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: clay, silty clay, or clay loam
Rock fragment content: 2 to 14 percent, mainly limestone or dolostone
Reaction: neutral to moderately alkaline

2BC or 2C horizon, where present: derived from less weathered residuum
Thickness: 2.5 to 10 cm (1 to 4 inches)
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 to 7
Chroma: 2 to 6
Texture: ranges from loamy sand to sandy clay loam, and includes the channery or very channery analogs of these textures
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. The Cynthiana, Dunbarton, and Opequon series are in related families. Cynthiana and Opequon soils have mixed mineralogy, and Dunbarton soils have smectitic mineralogy.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Biglick soils are on monadnocks on till plains of late Wisconsin age. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. The soils formed in drift and in the underlying residuum from limestone or dolostone of Silurian age. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 1067 mm (32 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 13 degrees C (49 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 180 days. Elevation is 244 to 305 meters (800 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Channahon, Millsdale, Milton, and Randolph series. The Channahon soils have a mollic epipedon and are formed in loamy drift. The well drained Milton, somewhat poorly drained Randolph, and the very poorly drained Millsdale soils have limestone at 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches).

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The potential for surface runoff is low to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or moderately low in the clayey residuum. Permeability is moderately slow or slow in the clayey residuum.

USE AND VEGETATION: A large proportion is under cultivation. Principal crops are hay, pasture, corn, soybeans, wheat, and oats. Native vegetation is deciduous forest of sugar maple, oak, hickory, and black walnut.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Ohio; MLRA 111B. The series is of small extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Hancock County, Ohio, 1997.

REMARKS: Biglick soils are being converted from taxadjuncts of the Ritchey series during modernization projects in MLRA 111.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 25 cm (Ap horizon).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 25 to 36 cm (2Bt horizon).
Lithic contact: at 36 cm (top of the 2R layer).

ADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory characterization data from The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory is available for pedons WY-17 and HK-34. WY-17 was correlated as a clayey taxadjunct to the Ritchey series. HK-34 is from within the type location delineation. Data is available from the type location pedon, SS# 12941 and SS# 12942.

Representative data mapunit is DMU ID 129962.
