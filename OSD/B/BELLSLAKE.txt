BELLSLAKE SERIES


The Bellslake series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils on flood plains. They formed in material weathered from alluvium and organic material. Permeability is moderate. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. The average annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 30 inches.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bellslake soils are in basins on flood plains and in depressions of low stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. These soils formed in material weathered from alluvium and organic material. Elevations range from 1,820 to 2,190 feet. The average annual air temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F, average annual precipitation is 20 to 32 inches, and the frost-free season is from 80 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Miesen and Ramsdell soils. Miesen soils are on higher positions of flood plains, and are somewhat poorly drained and lack organic layers. Ramsdell soils are on adjacent positions of flood plains and lack organic layers.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: very poorly drained; ponded (no runoff); moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for hay and pasture, wetland wildlife habitat, and recreation. Potential natural vegetation is mainly sedges, rush, cattails, quackgrass, reed canarygrass, iris, Douglas hawthorn, thinleaf alder, and Pacific willow.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Idaho; MLRA 44. This soil is not extensive.
