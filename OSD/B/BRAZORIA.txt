BRAZORIA SERIES

The Brazoria series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in clayey alluvial sediments on the flood plains of the Brazos and Colorado Rivers. These gently to moderate sloping soils occur on flood plains of the Coastal Plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation range from 1092 to 1397 mm (43 to 55 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 19.5 to 21.7 degrees C (67 to 71 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Pledger series and the Asa, Clemville, Lake Charles, Laewest, and Norwood series. 
Pledger soils: on a similar landform; have darker colors to greater depth.
Asa and Norwood soils: on a slightly higher landform; loamy throughout
Clemville soils: on a slightly higher landform; have a fine-silty particle-size control sections.
Lake Charles and Laewest soils: are on slightly higher landform that does not have a chance for flooding; have darker colors to a greater depth

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. Permeability is very slow. Runoff is high on slope less than 1 percent; very high on slope greater than 1 percent. The overwash phase is somewhat poorly drained. The soil floods rarely or commonly, except where protected

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used as cropland for production of cotton, sorghum, corn, and soybeans. Some areas are used for improved pasture of bermudagrass, dallisgrass, and white clover. Native vegetation is pecan, elm, hackberry, oak, and ash trees and mid and tall grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mainly along the lower reaches of the Brazos and Colorado Rivers; Land Resource Region-T; MLRA-150A. The series is of large extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Brazoria County, Texas; 1978.

REMARKS: Classification change from mixed to smectitic based laboratory data from Colorado County. Laboratory data from Brazoria County indicates mixed mineralogy, but very close to smectitic. Type location changed during Soil Data Join Recorrelation (2014) to a location with characterization data.
