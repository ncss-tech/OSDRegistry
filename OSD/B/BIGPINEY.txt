BIGPINEY SERIES

The Bigpiney series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. These soils are on floodplains. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 205 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 4.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Ustic Aquicambids

TYPICAL PEDON: Bigpiney clay loam in irrigated hayland. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted).

 Oe--0 to 6 cm; moderately decomposed plant material; clear smooth boundary (0 to 8 cm thick)

 A--6 to 10 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/2), dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine tubular pores; finely disseminated carbonate; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 12 cm thick)

 Bk--10 to 43 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/3) clay, brown (7.5YR 5/3), dry; moderate medium prismatic structure; very firm, hard, very sticky, very plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine tubular pores; 5 percent fine distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) moist redox concentrations; finely disseminated carbonate; electrical conductivity 2 to 4 mmol/L; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary. (8 to 33 cm thick)

 Bkz--43 to 93 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay, brown (7.5YR 5/4), dry; moderate coarse prismatic structure; extremely firm, very hard, very sticky, very plastic; common fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 5 percent fine distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) moist redox concentrations; finely disseminated carbonate; 10 percent irregular salt masses in matrix; electrical conductivity 8 to 16 mmol/L; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); gradual wavy boundary. (20 to 50 cm thick)

 BCkz--93 to 200 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay, brown (7.5YR 5/4), dry; strong coarse prismatic structure; extremely firm, very hard, very sticky, very plastic; finely disseminated carbonates; electrical conductivity 8 to 16 mmol/L; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).
