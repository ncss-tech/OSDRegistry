BRODIE SERIES

The Brodie series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rock over residuum weathered from sandstone and shale.  These soils are on escarpments, eroded fan remnants or hills.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 1 degree C.
