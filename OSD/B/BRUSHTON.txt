BRUSHTON SERIES

The Brushton series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Brushton soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, and sedimentary plains.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Brushton silt loam, nonirrigated cropland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 6 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium and coarse granular; soft, friable, sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 7 inches thick)

    Bt1--6 to 12 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) silty clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate coarse prismatic  structure parting to strong fine and medium angular blocky; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine pores; very few faint clay films on faces of peds; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.

    Bt2--12 to 18 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam,  brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to strong medium angular blocky; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine roots; common very few faint clay films on faces of peds; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual wavy boundary. (The combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 6 to 12 inches.)

    Bk1--18 to 28 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate coarse subangular blocky; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine pores; common fine and medium rounded  masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 25 inches thick)

    Bk2--28 to 36 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common fine and very fine pores; common fine irregular masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 15 inches thick)

    BC--36 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Custer County, Montana; 1995.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1472.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 12 inches, mixed (Ap, Bt1 horizons); an argillic horizon from 6 to 18 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizons); a particle-size control section from 6 to 18 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizons); horizons of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation from 18 to 36 inches (Bk1, Bk2 horizons).  Brushton soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.
