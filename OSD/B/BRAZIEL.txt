BRAZIEL SERIES

The Braziel series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till or colluvium derived from fine grained extrusive igneous and sedimentary rocks. These soils are on till plains, hills, escarpments, moraines, stream terraces and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Braziel gravelly loam, rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless noted otherwise).

    A1--0 to 4 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; 5 percent cobbles, 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.

    A2--4 to 8 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine and common fine tubular pores; 5 percent cobbles, 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizons is 7 to 15 inches.)

    Bt1--8 to 17 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, and common medium roots; many very fine discontinuous tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 5 percent cobbles, 30 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (9 to 21 inches thick)

    Bt2--17 to 23 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, and common medium roots; many very fine and fine continuous tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 5 percent cobbles, 35 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 20 inches thick)

    Bt3--23 to 43 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine continuous tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 10 percent cobbles, 40 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 25 inches thick)

    BC--43 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular continuous pores; 45 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.2).
