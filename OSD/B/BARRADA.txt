BARRADA SERIES

The Barrada series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in saline, clayey over loamy alluvial and storm washover sediments of Holocene age.  These nearly level soils are on wind tidal flats and in enclosed depressions.  Slopes are less than 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 22.8 degrees C (73 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, calcareous, hyperthermic Typic Halaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Barrada clay-barren flat. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  Similar soils are the Arrada (TX), Burkemont (OR), Equis (NV), Saucel (TX), Topo (TX), and Yarborough (TX) series.
Arrada: have a fine-loamy particle-size control section
Burkemont: have a fine particle-size control section, smectitic clay mineralogy, calcareous, and mesic temperature regime
Equis: fine particle-size control section, carbonatic, and mesic temperature regime
Saucel: coarse-loamy particle-size control section
Topo: coarse-loamy particle-size control section, calcareous, and hyperthermic temperature regime
Yarborough: coarse-loamy particle-size control section, siliceous, calcareous, and hyperthermic temperature regime

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent Material: clayey over loamy alluvium and storm washover sediments derived from igneous, metatmorphic and sedimentary rock.
Landscape: barrier islands on low coastal plains
Landform: wind tidal flat and enclosed depressions

Mean annual air temperature: 22.2 to 23.4 degrees C (72 to 74 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 635 to 991 mm (25 to 39 in)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Arrada, Lalinda, Lomalta, Point Isabel, and Sejita series.
Arrada: have a fine-loamy particle-size family and are in similar landscapes.
Lalinda: have an ustic moisture regime and are in dune positions on slightly higher landscapes.
Lomalta: are on slightly higher landscapes and have intersecting slickensides.
Point Isabel: are on slightly higher landscapes, are better drained, are less saline, and are on vegetated dunes.
Sejita: are on slightly higher landscapes and are in the fine-silty family.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained.  Permeability is very slow.  Runoff is negligible.  Gulf storms and very high tides flood most areas causing ponding for brief periods.  Very frequent flooding in areas next to bays with occasional ponding.  Permanent water table fluctuates from the surface to depths of 91 cm (36 in).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for wildlife habitat and recreation.  Flora and fauna of marine origin persist for a few weeks after inundation until salinity becomes toxic.  Soils are mostly barren.  The ecological site is Tidal Flat, PE 31-44 (R150BY716TX).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Gulf Coast Saline Prairies (MLRA 150B in LRR T) of the southern Texas coast.  This soil is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Cameron County, Texas; 1970.

REMARKS:  This is a Benchmark Series.
Classification change from Aquollic Salorthids to Typic Aquisalids based on application of the 6th edition of Soil Taxonomy 1998.  Classification change from Typic Aquisalids to Typic Halaquepts based on 10th edition of Soil Taxonomy 2007.
These soils were formerly classified as a miscellaneous land type, tidal flats or mud flats.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon: surface of the soil to a depth of approximately 10 cm (4 in) (Anzg horizon)
Salic horizon: surface of the soil to a depth of approximately 160 cm (63 in) (Anzg, BCnzg, 2BCnzg horizons)
Lithologic discontinuity: 132 to 160 cm (52 to 63 in) (2BCnzg horizon)
