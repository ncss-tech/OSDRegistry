BROADHEAD SERIES

The Broadhead series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in glacial drift and colluvium weathered from mixed igneous and metamorphic rocks.  Broadhead soils are on fan remnants, hills, and mountain slopes and have slopes of 0 to 70 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 21 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Pachic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Broadhead very cobbly loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A1--0 to 5 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very cobbly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak thin platy structure parting to moderate fine granular; loose, very friable, slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; 55 percent cobbles, gravel and stones; neutral (pH 6.7); clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 5 inches thick)

    A2--5 to 12 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate coarse granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 14 inches thick)

    Bt1--12 to 34 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; strong fine and medium angular blocky structure; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine and medium roots; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 29 inches thick)

    Bt2--34 to 44 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; few thin clay films on faces of some peds and pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); diffuse smooth boundary.  (0 to 27 inches thick)

    C--44 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; firm, sticky and slightly plastic; neutral (pH 6.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  Wasatch County, Utah; 1.6 miles north from the center of Heber on U.S. Highway 40 and east 1.7 miles on side road; 2,640 feet west and 1,000 feet south of the northeast corner of sec. 21, T. 3 S., R. 5 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Mean annual soil temperature: 43 to 47 degrees F.
Mean summer temperature: 63 to 68 degrees F.
Soil moisture:  The soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 80 consecutive days in more than 7 out of 10 years. The moisture regime is typic xeric.

Thickness of the mollic epipedon: more than 20 inches
Depth to secondary carbonates: greater than 40 inches

Particle-size control section:
Coarse fragment content: 0 to 15 percent
Clay content: 35 to 55 percent

A horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 3 to 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3 dry or moist
Reaction: moderately acid to neutral.

Bt horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 to 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: clay, silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam
Reaction: slightly acid through slightly alkaline.

BC horizon (present in some pedons):

C horizon: (not present in all pedons)
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 7 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: silt loam, loam or clay loam and is gravelly or cobbly in some pedons

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Arcia (NV), Arva (NV), Bumpheads, Cristo (UT), Henefer (UT), Rugar (NV), Schnipps, and Sweitberg (WA) series.  Arcia, Cristo and Sweitberg soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact.  Bumpheads soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Arva soils have more than 15 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section.  Rugar soils have iron-manganese nodules and redoximorphic concentrations in the Bt horizon.  Schnipps soils are deep to a lithic contact. Henefer soils have 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments in the argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Broadhead soils are on fan remnants, hills, and sloping to very steep mountain slopes at elevations of 5,000 to 7,500 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  The soils formed in glacial drift, colluvium and alluvium derived mainly from mixed intermediate igneous parent rocks and some sandstone and quartzite.  The climate is moist subhumid.  The mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F. the mean summer temperature is about 63 to 65 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation is about 15 to 25 inches.  The freeze-free period is about 50 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Eastcan, Little Pole, McPhie, Pringle and Utaba soils.  Eastcan, Pringle and Utaba soils lack argillic horizons and have less than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Little Pole soils are less than 20 inches deep to bedrock.  McPhie soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick, E horizons and coarse loamy particle size control sections.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to very rapid runoff; slow or moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for range, watershed and wildlife habitat.  Some are used for irrigated cropland.  Potential vegetation is bluegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, oakbrush, and mountain big sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Wasatch Mountains of north-central Utah and south eastern Idaho.  Moderately extensive. MLRA 13, 28A, and 47.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Wasatch County (Wasatch Area), Utah, 1971.

REMARKS:  The diagnostic features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 34 inches.  (A1, A2, Bt horizons)
Argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 12 to 44 inches.  (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)

In Utah this series is correlated with Mountain range sites.
