BUCKBOARD SERIES

The Buckboard series consists of very deep, well drained soils on lake terraces.  They formed in lacustrine sediments.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Buckboard loam, nonirrigated cropland; on a 2 percent slope at 5000 feet elevation.  When described on June 5, 1986, the soil was moist below nine inches.  (Color is for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Ap--0 to 9 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and common fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 2 percent gravel; sightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (7 to 12 inches thick)

    A--9 to 15 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist;  weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 1 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

    Bw1--15 to 23 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 1 percent gravel; 10 percent hard nodules; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt wavy boundary.  (6 to 15 inches thick)

    Bw2--23 to 43 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 10 percent hard nodules; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (15 to 25 inches thick)

    Bw3--43 to 50 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine irregular pores;  moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Bk1--50 to 59 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine irregular pores; few fine lime veins; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (7 to 12 inches thick)

    Bk2--59 to 65 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few large prominent dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) irregularly shaped iron masses, iron masses are relict redoximorphic features; many medium soft masses of secondary lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Oneida County, Idaho; about 15 miles southwest of Malad; about 2000 feet west and 2700 feet north of the southeast corner of sec.  35, T. 15 S., R. 34 E.  Latitude - 42 degrees, 4 minutes, 25 seconds North; Longitude - 112 degrees, 26 minutes, 49 seconds West.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Mollic epipedon thickness - 20 to 30 inches

Reaction of profile - slightly to moderately alkaline
Average annual soil temperature - 44 to 47 degrees F.

Particle-size control section:
Clay content average - 18 to 27 percent (total clay)

A horizons:
Value - 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma - 2 or 3 dry or moist

Bw horizons:
Value - 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist

Bk horizons:
Value - 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist
Chroma - 2 or 3 dry or moist

Rounded rock fragments - 0 to 5 percent
Calcium carbonate equivalent - 5 to 10 percent

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Izee, Pearlwise, Petescreek (T), Utley, Wallowa (T), and Wrightman series.  Izee, Pearlwise, Petescreek, Wallowa, and Wrightman soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Utley soils have 5 to 35 percent shale fragments and are neutral or slightly acid.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Buckboard soils are on lake terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,900 to 5,200 feet.  The soil formed in lacustrine sediments.  The average annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches; the average annual air temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Bancroft, Bothwell, Elevator (T), Jensen (T), and Povirt (T) soils.  Bancroft, Bothwell, Elevator, and Povirt soils have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick.  Jensen soils have lime 16 to 40 inches deep.  Bancroft soils are on fan terraces and mountain footslopes.  Bothwell soils are on lake terraces and hillsides.  Elevator, Jensen, and Povirt soils are on lake terraces.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Buckboard soils are used for nonirrigated cropland.   The vegetation is mainly small grains and alfalfa.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho.  The soils of this series are not extensive.
