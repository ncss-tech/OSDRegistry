BRUMLEY SERIES

The Brumley series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived dominantly from sandstone.  Brumley soils are on terraces and mesas.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Calcidic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Brumley loam, on an east facing, simple 3 percent slope in pinyon-juniper woodland, at an elevation of 7,040 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  Described on October 3, 1984.

    A--0 to 2 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt--2 to 17 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to strong fine subangular blocky; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium roots; common fine, and few medium pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (12 to 25 inches thick)

    Btk--17 to 25 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few medium tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; slightly effervescent with calcium carbonate disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary.  (3 to 11 inches thick)

    Bk1--25 to 40 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine pores; violently effervescent; calcium carbonate disseminated and in small masses; 28 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 20 inches thick)

    Bk2--40 to 60 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; hard, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; violently effervescent; calcium carbonate disseminated and in small masses and seams; 37 percent calcium carbonate equivalent, decreasing with depth; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Alire, Banquito, Nomrah, and Todest series.
Soils that are presently classified as Aridic Haplustalfs that have a calcic horizon starting within 40 inches are the Goesling and Maia series.

Alire:  Has volcanic glass in the profile.
Banquito and Todest soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. 
Goesling and Nomrah soils are dry in the moisture control section for longer periods (in May and June).  In addition, Nomrah soils have the base of the argillic horizon between 40 and 60 inches. 
Maia soils have 15 to 30 percent rock fragments within 40 inches of the surface. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material:  slope alluvium derived dominantly from sandstone.
Landform:  terraces and mesas.
Slopes:  1 to 12 percent
Elevation: 6,800 to 7,200 feet
Mean annual temperature:  46 to 52 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  12 to 15 inches.
   Wettest Months:  July and August. 
   Driest Months:  May and June receive the least precipitation, however, the soils are still moist from snowmelt through May.
Frost-free period:  100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arabrab series.  Arabrab soils are shallow to sandstone bedrock and are on sideslopes of drainageways.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  well drained, low runoff, moderately slow permeability.  

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is Indian ricegrass, western wheatgrass, Basin big sagebrush, Junegrass, muttongrass, needlegrass, pinyon and Juniper .

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwest Colorado.  LRR D, MLRA 36.  This series is of moderate extent.
