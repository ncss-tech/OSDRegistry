BOULFLAT SERIES

The Boulflat series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from chert, shale, quartzite and andesite with a component of loess high in volcanic ash.  The Boulflat soils are on mountain and hill crests and side slopes.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TYPE LOCATION:   Eureka County, Nevada; about 1 1/2 miles northeast of The junction of Highways I-80 and Nevada State 21; approximately 2,900 feet north of the southwest corner of section 2, T. 32 N., R. 49 E., Mount Diablo base line and meridian; USGS Bobs Flat 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 40 minutes 31 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 25 minutes 28 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.6752778 latitude, -116.4244444 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Reaction:  Neutral or slightly alkaline.

Bt horizons 
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4.
Texture:  Gravelly loam, gravelly clay loam, or gravelly sandy clay loam.
Structure:  Weak or moderate, very fine to medium subangular or angular blocky.

Reaction:  Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.
Effervescence:  Strongly effervescent or violently effervescent.
Carbonates:  All gravel are carbonate coated.

Bkqm horizon
Value:  7 or 8 dry, 6 through 8 moist.
Chroma:  1 through 4.
Effervescence:  Strongly effervescent or violently effervescent.
Silica laminae:  Up to 5 mm thick and not continuous horizontally.
Other features:  Strongly cemented duripan rests directly on bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES:   These are Aquinas, Cherry Spring, Eastval, Spasprey, Yody and Zaidy series.  

Aquinas, Cherry Spring, Eastval, Spasprey, Yody and Zaidy soils all lack bedrock within a depth of 100 cm.   In addition, Aquinas Cherry Spring and Eastvall soils have a combined A and Bt thickness of more than 50 cm and Yody soils have a calcic horizon above the duripan.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Boulflat soils are on mountain and hill crests and side slopes.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from chert, shale, quartzite and andesite with a component of loess high in volcanic ash.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 1,520 to 1,830 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with hot dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are The Brock, Havingdon, Humdun and Rad soils.  Brock soils have indurated duripans at shallow depths.  Havingdon soils have clayey-skeletal particle-size control sections and are moderately deep over bedrock.  Humdun soils are very deep and have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections. Rad soils are very deep and have coarse-silty particle-size control sections.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:   Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, Douglas rabbitbrush, Thurber needlegrass, Sandberg bluegrass and cheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:   North central Nevada.  These soils are not extensive. MLRA 24.
