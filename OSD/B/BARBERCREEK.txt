BARBERCREEK SERIES

The Barbercreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed on alluvial fans and fan remnants of alluvial plains. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1520 millimeters. The mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Dystric Fluventic Eutrudepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Barbercreek silt loam on a 2 percent slope under perennial grasses, clover, and thistle at an elevation of 19 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted. When described on November 25, 1992, the soil was moist throughout.)

 Ap--0 to 23 centimeters; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; strong fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary.

 Bw1--23 to 53 centimeters; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary.

 Bw2--53 to 71 centimeters; dark brown (10YR 3/3) silty clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary.

 C--71 to 152 centimeters; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) silty clay loam, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) dry; massive; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.5); gradual wavy boundary.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture: The soil in the soil moisture control section (between the depths 16 and 48 centimeters) is not dry in all parts for as long as 90 cumulative days in most years.  The soils have a udic moisture regime.

Soil Temperature: The mean annual soil temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C. The average summer soil temperature is about 18 degrees C. and the average winter soil temperature is about 9 degrees C. The difference between average summer and winter soil temperatures is about 6 to 9 degrees C.

There are Ab horizons in some profiles.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Jamesfin and Ray series. Jamesfin and Ray soils have a difference between average winter and summer soil temperature of more than 9 degrees C and have a mean January soil temperature below 8 degrees C. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Barbercreek soils are on alluvial fans and fan remnants. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. These soils formed in mixed alluvium. Elevation is 3 to 50 meters. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, rainy winters. Mean annual precipitation is 890 to 2030 millimeters.  The mean January temperature is about 8 degrees C. The mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C. The mean annual air temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C. Frost free season is about 275 to 330 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ferndale, Russ, Loleta and Arlynda soils. Ferndale soils are on high floodplain steps.  Russ soils are on natural levees and are coarse-silty. Loleta soils are in the same positions but are poorly drained. The Arlynda soils are on meander scars and depressions, and are very poorly drained.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; low runoff; moderately slow permeability, moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. The soils are rarely flooded for brief periods December through February. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for pasture, hay, and occasionally truck garden produce. Nearly all areas of this soil have been cleared.  The native vegetation is estimated to be a variable canopy of red alder, sitka spruce, and black cottonwood with scattered willow and redwood, with an understory of blackberry, ferns, and grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: California Coastal Redwood Belt. MLRA 4b. The series is not extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Humboldt County, California, 2016. Name is from creek near Ferndale, California.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 23 centimeters. (Ap horizon)
2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 23 to 71 centimeters. (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)
3. Eutrudepts feature -base saturation of greater than 60 percent, by ammonium acetate, in the zone from 25 to 100 centimeters
