REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 48 to 107 centimeters (19 to 39 inches) (Bt and Btg horizons).
Series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (0 to 59 inches) (Ap, A, Bt, Btg, BCg, and Cg horizons).
Mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 79 centimeters (0 to 31 inches) (Ap, A, and Bt horizons).
Argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 48 to 107 centimeters (19 to 42 inches) (Bt and Btg horizons).
Aquic moisture regime.

Lab data (Iowa State University) from the typical pedon location supports Vertic subgroup, yet other pedons do not have a linear extensibility of 6.0 cm within a depth of 100 cm.
