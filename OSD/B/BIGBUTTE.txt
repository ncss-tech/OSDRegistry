BIGBUTTE SERIES

The Bigbutte series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from rhyolite and other moderately fine-grained igneous rocks.  These soils are on mountains, hills, and benches.  Slopes are 6 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 432 millimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Ashy, glassy Vitrandic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bigbutte gravelly ashy sandy loam, in rangeland on a 12 percent slope at 1,896 meters elevation (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise indicated).

    A--0 to 25 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly ashy sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; very friable, soft, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine interstitial and irregular pores; 15 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary.  (18 to 30 cm thick)

    Bw--25 to 46 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly ashy sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable, soft, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; common fine irregular pores; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (15 to 70 cm thick)

    BC--46 to 69 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly ashy coarse sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; common fine irregular pores; 30 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (10 to 50 cm thick)

    Cr--69 to 81 cm; weakly cemented tuffaceous rhyolite.

    R--81 cm; indurated tuffaceous rhyolite.

COMPETING SERIES: 
Anniecreek (OR) - has Bg horizons. 
Brownsbowl (NV) - has a mollic epipedon 100 to 115 centimeters thick.
Cadero (ID) - is moderately deep to a paralithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - mountain, hills and benches
Elevation - 1,585 to 2,220 meters
Slope - 6 to 50 percent 
Parent material - volcanic ash influenced colluvium over rhyolite, rhyodacite, or rhyolitic tuff
Climate - long, cold winters; cold, moist springs; short, cool summers
Mean annual precipitation - 355 to 483 millimeters, much of which falls as snow and as spring rain
Mean annual air temperature - 1 to 5 degrees centigrade
Frost-free period - 50 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Poin, Euell and Hungryhill soils which occur on similar landforms.  Poin soils are in the loamy-skeletal particle-size family.  Euell soils are very deep.  Hungryhill soils have an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  well drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Bigbutte soils are used mainly for grazing. Native vegetation is Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, rough fescue, prairie junegrass, big sagebrush and widely spaced Rocky Mountain juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Bigbutte soils are of small extent in the intermontane basins of central Montana. MLRA 43B.
