BORKY SERIES 

The Borky series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum from semiconsolidated interbedded shale and sandstone.  These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Borky very stony loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 4 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very stony loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; 25 percent stones, 5 percent cobbles, 15 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick) 

    Bt1--4 to 8 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) very stony clay, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to strong fine subangular blocky; very hard, friable, moderately sticky and very plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; 30 percent stones, 15 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. 

    Bt2--8 to 14 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very stony clay, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to strong fine subangular blocky; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and very plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; many distinct clay film on faces of peds; 35 percent stones, 15 percent pebbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear irregular boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 9 to 18 inches) 

    Bk--14 to 32 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 8/4) very stony silty clay, pale yellow (2.5Y 7/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; 35 percent stones, 20 percent pebbles; common threads and masses of lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary. (9 to 22 inches thick) 

    Cr--32 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 8/4) shale interbedded with thin lenses of sandstone.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT0031.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the surface to 8 inches (A, Bt1 horizons); an argillic horizon and particle-size control section from 4 to 14 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizons); a horizon of lime accumulation from 14 to 32 inches (Bk horizon); and a paralithic contact at 32 inches (Cr horizon).  Borky soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
