BOBERT SERIES

The Bobert series consists of very deep, moderately well drained or well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Bobert soils are on lake terraces and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Durinodic Xeric Natrargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bobert sandy loam--on 1 percent slope under a plant community of basin big sagebrush and black greasewood--rangeland.  (When described April 7, 1986, the soil was moist to 26 inches.  Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Geysen, Godecke, and Pokergap series.

Geysen soils have natric horizons with sodium adsorption ratios of 13 to 45 and have mean annual soil temperature of 48 to 52 degrees F.  Godecke soils average 31 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section, have natric horizons with sodium adsorption ratios of 31 to 45, and have mean annual soil temperature of 48 to 53 degrees F.  Pokergap soils average 10 to 25 percent gravel in the particle-size control section, have natric horizons with sodium adsorption ratios of 13 to 23, and have horizons within 14 inches of the soil surface that contain 35 to 60 percent gravel.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bobert soils are on lake terraces and stream terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,000 to 4,120 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Herjun, Honlak, Standish, and Yobe soils.  Herjun soils are coarse-loamy and do not have natric horizons.   Honlak soils have endosaturation within 40 inches of the soil surface.  Standish soils are fine and do not have horizons with a firm, brittle matrix.  Yobe soils are fine-silty and do not have natric horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained or well drained; medium surface runoff; slow permeability.  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 3.5 and 5 feet (deep free water occurrence class) between December and April.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Bobert soils are used as rangeland with some areas used for irrigated pasture.  In rangeland the vegetation is basin big sagebrush, spiny hopsage, black greasewood, and inland saltgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern California.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 23, 27.
