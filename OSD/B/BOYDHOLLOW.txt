BOYDHOLLOW SERIES


The Boydhollow series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and conglomerate. These soils are on hillslopes and mountain slopes. Slopes are 15 to 65 percent. Permeability is moderately rapid. The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Boundridge (T), Pontuge (T), Slan (T) and Warshod (T) soils. Boundridge soils are on gently sloping summits, have a duripan within 20 inches and have a mollic epipedon less than 16 inches thick.. Pontuge soils are on less-sloping north and east facing side slopes and have an argillic horizon. Slan soils are on southerly facing side slopes, have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches and are frigid. Warshod soils are on the same position as Boydhollow soils but at lower elevations, are frigid, and have a paralithic contact at 40 to 60 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; very rapid runoff; moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for rangeland, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Native vegetation is mountain big sagebrush, serviceberry, arrowleaf balsamroot, and bluebunch wheatgrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeast, Idaho. These soils are of small extent. MLRA 43B.
