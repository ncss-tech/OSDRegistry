SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:
Wasco County, Oregon, 1975

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features in this pedon
*Particle-size control section--zone from 25 to 46 cm
*Mollic epipedon--zone from 0 to 46 cm
*Vitrandic feature--zone from 0 to 46 cm
*Lithic contact--basalt at 46 cm

Further investigation is needed to assess vitrandic properties in this soil and to determine the depth to which the ash influence extends (whether it includes the A and Bw horizons or is limited to the A horizon only); it is possible there is some spatial variability across this series' extent, with regard to vitrandic properties.

NASIS SITE ID--1975OR065009; NASIS PEDON ID--1975OR065009

3/3/2022--updated this official series description to add an ashy textural modifier to the surface texture and define vitrandic properties; to add MLRA 21 (to cover recent updates in the OR683 soil survey); to slightly expand some of the ranges in color, rock fragments, temperature and elevation; and to update the competing series section.
