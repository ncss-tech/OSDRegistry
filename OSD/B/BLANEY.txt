SERIES ESTABLISHED: Scotland County, North Carolina; 1965

REMARKS: Additional investigation of the Blaney soils are needed to better define the amount of fragic soil properties and the degree of clay activity. Blaney soils were initially established as Arenic Fragiudults and were reclassified (1979) to Arenic Hapludults.  With 10 to 20 percent brittleness and friable moist consistence (Bt horizon of the type location) the 2005 series revision limited the range of the series to 10 to 30 percent brittleness to eliminate any potential conflict with Fragic Hapludults (30 to 60 percent fragic soil properties). The series range in characteristics of the B was modified to allow the x suffix designation to be used with the series where pedogenic brittleness, firmness, and root-restrictive character is observed in less than 30 percent of the mass. Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 25 inches (A, E1, E2 horizons)
Albic horizon (materials)--the zone from 3 to 25 inches (E1, E2 horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 25 to 65 inches (Bt, BCt horizons)
Fragic soil properties--the zone from 25 to 65 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Btx horizons)
Series control section--the zone from 0 to more than 65 inches
