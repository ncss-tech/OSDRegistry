BUBUS SERIES

The Bubus series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks of mostly volcanic origin that are high in pyroclastic materials.  Bubus soils are on alluvial flat remnants, alluvial flats, inset fans, fan skirts, alluvial plain terraces, stream terraces and basin floor remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Duric Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bubus very fine sandy loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

TYPE LOCATION:  Lander County, Nevada; approximately 1.6 miles southeast of Battle Mountain; about 2,100 feet south and 1,750 feet east of the northwest corner of section 28, T. 32 N., R. 45 E.; USGS Blossom Spring 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 37 minutes 11 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 54 minutes 50 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees  40.6197222 latitude,  -116.9138889 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry; moist in winter and spring, dry late May through November; typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 12 degrees C.
Depth to durinodes: 25 to 76 cm.
Other features: Faint or distinct iron concentrations and gypsum segregations are lacking in horizons below a depth of 25 cm in some pedons.
Ck horizons are above the Cq horizons in some pedons.
Salt and sodium:  These soils are normally strongly salt and sodium affected throughout the profile, but some pedons are only moderately or slightly affected in the upper horizons.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  10 to 15 percent.
Rock fragments:  0 to 5 percent gravel.

Texture: Very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam.
Consistence: Nonsticky or slightly sticky, wet.
Reaction:  Moderately alkaline through very strongly alkaline.
Other features:  20 to 70 percent durinodes.

2C horizon (when present): Some pedons have stratified sand and gravel at depths below 100 cm.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Beryl, Blimo, Coldent, Nyak, Okan, and Valmy series.  

Beryl, Blimo, Nyak and Okan soils have aridic soil moisture regime that borders on xeric. Coldent soils average 4 to 10 percent clay in the control section and have soil temperature of 12 to 14 degrees C. Valmy soils have dominantly fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in their particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bubus soils are on alluvial flats, inset fans, alluvial plains, fan skirts, stream terraces, lakeplain terraces, alluvial flat remnants and basin floor remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks of mostly volcanic origin, high in pyroclastic materials.   Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevations are 1,200 to 2,100 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Batan, Landco, Reese, Relley, and Wholan soils.  Batan soils have fine-silty particle-size control sections.  Landco soils are coarse-silty over clayey particle- size control sections and lack a Cq horizon. Reese soils have fine-loamy particle-size control sections and have a weakly silica-cemented Cq horizon.  Relley soils have fine-silty particle-size control sections and a cambic horizon.  Wholan soils have coarse-silty particle-size control sections and a cambic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; ponded to medium runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly black greasewood, shadscale, bud sagebrush, rubber rabbitbrush, seepweed, mustard, cheatgrass, and basin wildrye.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central and central Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 24, 28B.
