BANDID SERIES

The Bandid series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in aerially deposited volcanic ash and pumice.  Bandid soils are on backslopes and footslopes of mountains at elevations of l,800 to 2,800 feet.  Slopes range from 5 to 90 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 130 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  There no competing series.  The Benham, Cinnamon, Pinchot, and Yalelake series are in other families.  Benham soils are in a cindery over medial family.  Cinnamon and Yalelake soils are in an ashy over medial family.  In addition Yalelake soils are mesic  Pinchot soils are in an ashy family and are mesic.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bandid soils are on backslopes and footslopes of mountains at elevations of l,800 to 2,800 feet.  Slopes are 5 to 99 percent.  Bandid soils formed in aerially deposited volcanic ash and pumice.  Beginning at the surface of the mineral soil the stratigraphy of pyroclastic material from Mt. St. Helens present in Bandid soil profiles is: (l) fresh ash and pumice including the 176-year-old "Layer T", (2) and (3) pumice of the 400-year-old "Layer W" and (4) ash, pumice and scoria of the2,500 year-old "B set."  The climate is characterized by cool, moist summers and cool, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 125 to 135 inches, including snow cover from December to April.  Average January temperature is 30 degrees F.; average July temperature is 6l degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the similar Bannel, Pelee, St. Helens, and Sinnice soils.  Bannel soils are ashy.  Pelee and Sinnice soils are cryic.  St. Helens soils are ashy over sandy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for timber production, recreation, wildlife habitat and watershed.  Overstory vegetation includes western hemlock, Douglas-fir and Pacific silver fir; ground cover includes vine maple, Sitka alder, huckleberry, bunchberry dogwood, pearly everlasting and fire willowweed.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Skamania County, Washington; east of Mt. St. Helens.  The series is of small extent.
