BULLARDS SERIES

The Bullards series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed eolian marine deposits.  Bullards soils are on terraces and have slopes of 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, isotic, isomesic Typic Haplorthods

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bullards sandy loam - on a 3 percent convex slope in a forested area.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 3 inches; litter of leaves, twigs, stems in various stages of decomposition; abrupt smooth boundary.

    A--3 to 10 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak medium granular and subanglar blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many (1/2 of volume) very fine to coarse roots; about 10 percent 2 to 5 mm hard nodules; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 8 inches thick)

    Bs1--10 to 19 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) gravelly sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) dry; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine to coarse roots; about 20 percent 2 to 10 mm hard nodules or pellets; ped coatings in upper part of horizon; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); abrupt irregular boundary.

    Bs2--19 to 30 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) gravelly sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) dry; weak, medium, subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; about 20 percent 2 to 10 mm nodules or pellets; strongly acid (pH 5.4); gradual wavy boundary.

    Bs3--30 to 44 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) gravelly sandy loam, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) dry; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; about 25 percent 2 to 20 mm hard nodules and cemented fragments; strongly acid (pH 5.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (Combined Bs horizon is 24 to 45 inches thick.)

    C--44 to 60 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) sand, brownish yellow and yellow (10YR 6/6, 7/6) dry; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; moderately acid (pH 5.7).

TYPE LOCATION:  Coos County, Oregon; 5 miles north of Bandon; 2,200 feet north, 1,100 feet west of the SE corner, section 32, T. 27 S., R. 14 W., on the Round Lake Road west of Seven Devils Road.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 51 to 55 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F.  The soils have a udic moisture regime, but have a short dry period of less than 45 consecutive days during the four-month period following the summer solstice.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The Bs horizon is 24 to 45 inches thick and has 15 to 35 percent 2 to 20 mm iron cemented nodules.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry.  Some pedons lack an A horizon and have an E horizon.  It is sandy loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.  It is very strongly acid or strongly acid.

The Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 7 dry and chroma of 4 through 8 moist and dry. It is gravelly loam or gravelly sandy loam and has 8 to 18 percent clay.  It is very strongly acid to moderately acid.

The C horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 to 8 moist and dry.  It is loamy fine sand or sand with a thin weakly cemented lense in some pedons.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bullards soils are on deeply dissected marine terraces at elevations of 15 to 600 feet. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in sandy alluvial and eolian materials on old sand dunes and back-beach deposits.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and cool moist summers with fog.  The mean annual precipitation is 55 to 90 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 300 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bandon, Blacklock, Ferrelo and Templeton soils.  Bandon and Blacklock soils have a cemented pan and Blacklock soils are poorly drained.  Ferrelo soils lack a spodic horizon and have an umbric epipedon.  Templeton soils lack a spodic horizon and are fine-silty.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Bullards soils are used primarily for timber production, pasture and wildlife habitat. The natural vegetation is Douglas fir, shore pine, western redcedar, Sitka spruce, red alder, Pacific madrone, Pacific rhododendron, evergreen huckleberry, salal and brackenfern.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Bullards soils are on the coastal marine terraces in Oregon; MLRA 1.  They are moderately extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lane County Area, Oregon, 1981.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 3 to 10 inches having umbric colors but too thin for an umbric epipedon.

Spodic horizon - the zone from 10 to 44 inches having spodic materials (Bs1, Bs2, and Bs3 horizons).

Organic carbon in spodic horizon - the zone from 10 to 19 inches is 2.06 percent; from 19 to 30 inches is 1.36 percent; and from 30 to 44 inches is 0.96 percent.

All diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization data from two pedons (S74Oreg-11-28 and 11-8) from Coos County, Oregon, by SCS Lincoln Laboratory.
