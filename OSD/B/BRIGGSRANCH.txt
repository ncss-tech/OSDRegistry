BRIGGSRANCH SERIES

The Briggsranch series consists of very shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from conglomerate, quartzite, limestone and dolomite. These soils occur on escarpments, mountain slopes and canyons.  Slopes are 15 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 405 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed Lithic Cryorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Briggsranch gravelly loamy sand, on a 60 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 2,230 meters (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

	A--0 to 4 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loamy sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few coarse, medium, fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine irregular interstitial pores; 30 percent gravel and a trace of cobbles; violently effervescent; disseminated calcium carbonate; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 8 cm thick)

	C1--4 to 10 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly loamy sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many coarse, medium, fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine irregular interstitial pores; 70 percent gravel and a trace of cobbles; violently effervescent; disseminated calcium carbonate; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.

	C2--10 to 22 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many coarse, medium, fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine irregular interstitial pores; 80 percent gravel and a trace of cobbles; violently effervescent; disseminated calcium carbonate; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary. (combined thickness of C horizons - 10 to 20 cm thick)

	R--22 to 152 cm; indurated calcareous conglomerate bedrock.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; rapid permeability over nearly impermeable bedrock.

USE AND VEGETATION: Briggsranch soils are used mainly for rangeland and wildlife habitat. Potential native vegetation is mainly curlleaf mountain mahogany, grey horsebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, kingspike fescue, needleandthread, indian ricegrass, prickly pear cactus and miscellaneous forbs and half shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Briggsranch soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.  MLRA - 43B.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Horse Prairie-South Valley Area - Part of Beaverhead County, Montana, 2011; proposed in Beaverhead County, Montana, 2008.
REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon - from the soil surface to 4 cm (A horizon)
Lithic contact - at a depth of 22 cm (R horizon)
