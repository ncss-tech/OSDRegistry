BITTERROOT SERIES

The Bitterroot series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, or residuum from lithified earthflow deposits. These soils are on eroded fan remnants, earthflows and escarpments. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Bitterroot gravelly loam, in rangeland on a 6 percent slope at 1,126 meters elevation. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 32 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (18 to 38 cm thick) 

    Bt--32 to 47 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 10 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 15 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 52 cm thick)  

    Bk--47 to 79 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; common fine irregular pores; 15 percent gravel; finely disseminated carbonates and 10 percent prominent carbonate coats on rock fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); clear smooth boundary.
