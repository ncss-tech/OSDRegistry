BAYHOOK SERIES

The Bayhook series consists of very deep, well drained soils that are formed in lacustrine sediments on lake terraces.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Sodic Xeric Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bayhook silt loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 3 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate very coarse platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; few very fine tubular and many very fine and few fine vesicular pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)

    A2--3 to 7 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine, medium, and coarse roots; common very fine and few fine tubular and common very fine vesicular pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (3 to 10 inches thick)

    Bk1--7 to 13 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam; brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine and coarse roots; common very fine tubular pores; 35 percent cicada krotovinas; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 12 inches thick)

    Bk2--13 to 25 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) silt loam; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) moist; massive; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; few thin weakly cemented laminated layers; 10 percent cicada krotovinas; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (8 to 17 inches thick)

    Bk3--25 to 33 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 8/2) silt loam; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 35 percent cicada krotovinas; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (6 to 15 inches thick)

    Bk4--33 to 60 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 8/2) silt loam; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 10 percent cicada krotovinas; violently effervescent; 2 percent rounded gravel; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  Oneida County, Idaho; about 2 miles south and 3 miles east of Black Pine; about 800 feet south and 300 feet east of the northwest corner of section 10, T.16S., R.30E.  Latitude - 42 degrees, 3 minutes, 19 seconds North; Longitude - 112 degrees, 56 minutes, 33 seconds West.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Depth to calcic horizon - 6 to 18 inches
Average annual soil temperature - 49 to 51 degrees F.
Average summer soil temperature - 67 to 69 degrees F.

Particle-size control section:
Clay content average - 6 to 17 percent (total clay)

A horizon:
Value - 3 or 4 moist
Chroma - 2 or 3 dry or moist
Reaction - moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline
Salinity - less than 1 to 8 mmhos per cm

Bk horizon:
Hue - 10YR through 5Y
Value - 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist
Chroma - 2 through 4 dry or moist
Reaction - moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline
Calcium carbonate equivalent - 15 to 30 percent
Salinity - 1 to 8 mmhos per cm
Rock fragments - 0 to 5 percent
Cicada krotovinas - 10 to 50 percent

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bahem, Bram, Idahome, Nyssaton, Pogal and Portino series.

Bahem soils have less than 10 percent cicada krotovinas in the Bk horizon and lack weakly cemented laminated layers with moderately slow permeability.  Bram soils are somewhat poorly drained.  Idahome soils have greater than 8 mmhos per cm of salinity in their Bk horizons.  Nyssaton soils have stratified lake sediments at a depth of 15 to 40 inches.  Pogal soils have more than 40 percent exchangeable sodium within a depth of 30 inches and are greater than 20 inches deep to a calcic horizon.  Portino soils have basalt at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bayhook soils are on lower lake terraces at elevations of 4,400 to 4,700 feet.  They formed in lacustrine sediments.   Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 11 inches.  The average annual air temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 110 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Bahem soil and the Mellor and Thiokol soils.  Bahem soils are on similar landscape positions as Bayhook.  Mellor soils are in concave positions and have a natric horizon.  Thiokol soils are in convex positions and have a fine-silty particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very slow to medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Bayhook soils are used for irrigated cropland and rangeland.  Crops include barley, wheat and alfalfa.  The native vegetation is basin big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, and arrowleaf balsamroot.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 28A.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Phoenix, Arizona.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Oneida County, Idaho, 1994.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 7 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).

Calcic horizon - The zone from 7 to 60 inches (Bk1, Bk2, Bk3, and Bk4 horizons).

Particle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of the Bk1, the Bk2, Bk3, and part of the Bk4 horizons).


The superactive cation exchange activity class was added to the taxonomic classification in December 2002 based on laboratory and soil property data.  The remainder of this document has not been completely updated.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data is available for a pedon of the Bayhook series other than the type location by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE.  The Soil Survey Sample Number is S90ID-071-003 and the SSL pedon number is 90P1050.
