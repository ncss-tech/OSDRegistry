BEELINE SERIES

The Beeline series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. Beeline soils are on fan terraces and hillslopes and have slopes of 3 to 45 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 73 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, hyperthermic, shallow Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Beeline very gravelly sandy loam, rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) Surface has 40 percent cover of fine pebbles.

    A--0 to 1 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) very gravelly sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/3) moist; weak thin platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 45 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 2 inches thick)

    C1--1 to 7 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (2 to 8 inches thick)

    C2--7 to 9 inches; pink (5YR 7/3) sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/3) moist; massive; hard, firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; few medium roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent pebbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (2 to 8 inches thick)

    2Cr--9 to 60 inches; pink (5YR 7/3) weakly cemented sandy conglomerate, common lime coating in joints.

TYPE LOCATION:  Maricopa County, Arizona; 1,200 feet west and 100 feet north of the southeast 1/4 of section 20, T.4N. R.7E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Intermittently moist in some parts of the SMCS during July-September and December-February. Typic aridic moisture regime.

MAST:  72 to 76 degrees F.

Depth to Cr horizon:  5 to 10 inches.

Rock fragments:  15 to 90 percent on soil surface; dominantly gravel but includes cobbles in some pedons. 0 to 35 percent pebbles in the control section.

A horizon:
Hue: 5YR or 7.5YR
Value: 5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3 dry or moist
Texture:  sandy loan
Carbonates:  Slightly or strongly effervescent.

C horizon:
Hue: 5YR or 7.5YR
Value: 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3 dry, 2 to 4 moist
Texture:  sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam
Clay content: 8 to 18 percent clay
Carbonates:  Strongly or violently effervescent; some pedons are noneffervescent immediately above the Cr horizon.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Beeline soils are on fan terraces and hillslopes and have slopes of 3 to 45 percent. They formed in material weathered from sandy conglomerate. Elevations are 1,400 to 2,000 feet. Beeline soils are in a hot arid continental climate. Average annual precipitation is 7 to 10 inches, occurring as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rains. Mean annual temperature is 70 to 74 degrees F. The frost-free period is 250 to 300 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ebon soils and the similar Cipriano and Gunsight soils. Ebon soils are deep and clayey-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for rangeland and recreation. Native vegetation is mainly creosotebush, triangle bursage, ratany, big galleta, barrel cactus, saguaro, ocotillo, whitethorn, littleleaf paloverde, Mormon-tea and bush muhly.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South Central Arizona. The series is inextensive. MLRA 40.
