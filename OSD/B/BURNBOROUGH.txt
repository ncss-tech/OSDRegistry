BURNBOROUGH SERIES

The Burnborough series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesitic and rhyolitic volcanic rocks. Burnborough soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Belate, Closkey, Devils, Dutchjohn, Gowjai, Granipeak, Jivas, Millan, Sumine, and Torro series.

Belate soils receive slightly less total precipitation and the depth of wetting is 38 to 50 cm in most years and also contain 25 to 30 percent clay in the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Closkey and Devils soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Dutchjohn soils are deep to a paralithic contact and have a Bq horizon above the argillic.  Gowjai soils have a Cq horizon with up to 15 percent durinodes.  Granipeak soils contain more than 50 percent sand in the control section.  Jivas soils are deep to a lithic contact.  Millan soils are moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and September and have the base of the argillic horizon at depths of 25 to 50 cm.  Sumine soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact.  Torro soils have more than 60 percent gravel in the Bt2 horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Burnborough soils are on hills and mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesitic and rhyolitic volcanic rocks. Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 1,670 to 2,745 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Gabica, Softscrabble, and Ticino soils.  Gabica soils are shallow to bedrock.  Softscrabble soils have a mollic epipedon more than 50 cm thick.  Ticino soils are fine-loamy and moderately deep to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Burnborough soils are used mainly for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is mountain big sagebrush, ephedra, mulesear wyethia, green rabbitbrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, Idaho fescue, and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western and northern Nevada. These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRAs 26, 27, 23, and 24.
