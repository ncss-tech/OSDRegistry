COMPETING SERIES: These are the Brady, Dixboro, Poseyville, Whiskerville, and Winamac series. Brady soils have less than 10 percent clay and more than 70 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Dixboro soils do not have a lithologic contact with till in the lower part of the series control section. Poseyville soils are less than 64 cm (25 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Whiskerville soils have more than 25 percent clay and less than 35 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Winamac soils do not have iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less in the upper part of the argillic horizon. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Budd soils are on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Budd soils formed in loamy and sandy outwash overlying loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1067 mm (30 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 11.7 degrees C (48 to 53 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 180 days. Elevation is 177 to 466 meters (580 to 1,530 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Brady, soils and the Bronson, Gilford, Goodell, and Winamac soils. The somewhat poorly drained Brady soils are on similar positions. The moderately well drained Bronson and Winamac soils are on higher landform positions. The poorly drained and very poorly drained Gilford and Goodell soils are in depressions. Budd soils are in a drainage sequence with the Goodell and Winamac soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Depth to the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm (0.5 to 1.5 feet) below the surface between November and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the outwash material and moderately low in the underlying till. Permeability is moderately rapid in the outwash material and slow in the underlying till. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Soils are mostly cultivated. Where drainage is adequate it is cropped to corn, small grain, beans, and grass-legume hay. A small part is in permanent pasture or forest. Native vegetation is deciduous forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 111C in northern Indiana. The series is of small extent.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon (mollic intergrade): from the surface to a depth of 23 cm (9 inches) (Ap horizon).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 38 to 76 cm (15 to 30 inches) (Bt horizon).
Aquic conditions: redoximorphic features present in all horizons below 23 cm (9 inches).

NASIS Data Mapunit ID 154143 represents the typical pedon in complex with Brady soils.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Lab characterization data is available for the typical pedon (S98IN131-014) from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE. Transect data (T98IN-131-379) for the typical pedon is on file in MLRA project office, Plymouth, Indiana. Transect shows 70 percent Budd and 30 percent Winamac soils.
