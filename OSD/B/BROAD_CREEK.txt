DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage Class: Subaqueous drainage
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: Moderately high to high
Soil Moisture Regime: Peraquic

Broad Creek soils are permanently submerged / continuously inundated with salt or brackish water. The presence of hypersulfidic materials within 50 cm of the soil surface puts these soils at risk for potential acid sulfate soil formation if they are dredged and exposed to the air.

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses: Areas of this soil are used for recreational fishing, swimming, and boating. Commercial uses include shell fishing and aquaculture.
Dominant Vegetation: Benthic fauna such as clams, blue crabs, and oysters are associated with this soil. Eelgrass (Zostera marina), sea lettuce (Ulva sp.), and horned pondweed (Zannichellia palustris) may occur on these soils.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Atlantic Coastal Plain sub-estuaries of the western portion of the Chesapeake Bay and Atlantic Seaboard estuaries of the Northern Coastal Plain in New Jersey. MLRA 149A. This series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Anne Arundel County, Maryland, 2022.

REMARKS: This subaqueous series is named for Broad Creek in the South River sub-estuary of Chesapeake Bay.  Areas of Broad Creek were formerly included with Water.

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are (Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2012):
-Ochric epipedon-the zone from 0 to 42 centimeters (Ase horizons)
-Peraquic feature-the zone from 0 to 183 centimeters is permanently saturated
-Hyper-sulfidic materials-the zone from 0 to 126 centimeters incubated pH values less than 4.0 after 16 weeks.
-n Value greater than 0.7 - the zone from 0 to 183 centimeters with a slightly fluid to very fluid manner of failure.
