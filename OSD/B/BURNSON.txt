BURNSON SERIES

The Burnson series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in clayey slope alluvium over residuum derived dominantly from sandstone and shale but with some influence from eolian material.  Burnson soils are on mesas, structural benches, and hills.  Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Burnac, Campspass, Echolake, Goldbug, Goldvale, Larkson, Loghill, Siesta, Silesca, and Spud series.

Bario, Goldbug, Goldvale, Larkson, and Spud soils:  do not have a lithic or paralithic contact within 60 inches of the mineral surface.

Loghill soils:  have accumulations of secondary calcium carbonate and have 15 to 50 percent rock fragments in the Btk and Bk horizons.

McVickers soils:  have light-colored eluvial horizons with value, dry greater than 4 and value, moist greater than 3 above the argillic horizon.

Siesta soils:  formed in parent materials derived from pyroclastic rocks and basalt and have cinders in the lower part of the argillic horizon .

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  clayey slope alluvium over residuum derived dominantly from sandstone and shale of the Dakota and Burrow canyon formation but with some influence from eolian material.
Landform:  mesas, structural benches, and hills
Slopes:  0 to 30 percent
Elevation: 7,100 to 9,000 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  41 to 45 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  17 to 23 inches.
  Wettest months:  July and August receive slightly more precipitation than other months.
  Driest months:  May and June receive the least precipitation, however the soils are moist through mid June from snowmelt.
Frost-free period:  70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Jemco, Detra, and Beje series.  All are on mesas and hillslopes.
Jemco soils are moderately deep over sandstone bedrock.
Detra soils have thick mollic epipedons.
Beje soils are shallow over sandstone bedrock and are also on ridges.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, low to very high runoff, slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major uses are commercial woodland, livestock grazing, and wildlife habitat.  The native plant community is ponderosa pine with an understory of Gambel's oak, snowberry, serviceberry, Arizona fescue, western wheatgrass, and needle grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Colorado.  LRR E, MLRA 48A.  This series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Cortez Area, Colorado, Parts of Dolores and Montezuma Counties, 1997. The type location is in the Animas-Dolores Area, Colorado.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 1 to 8 inches.  (A and AB horizons)  The soil is dark enough but not thick enough for a mollic epipedon.
Argillic horizon:  The zone from 8 to 29 inches.  (Bt horizons)
Lithic contact:  Sandstone bedrock at 44 inches.  (R layer)
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 8 to 28 inches.  (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)

Soil Taxonomy: Series clasified according to Second Edition, 1999

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Hydrometer analysis of Bt horizons done at the field lab.  A nearby site sampled by NSSL, sample number S86-CO-033-001, sampled as Burnac but further study by the field party determined the need for the hydrometer analysis and a new series.
