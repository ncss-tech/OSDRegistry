BUDLEWIS SERIES

The Budlewis series consists of soils that are well drained and moderately deep to a duripan that formed in alluvium and loess from mixed sources and residuum from basalt.  They are on terraces, calderas, foothills, structural benches, and tablelands.  Permeability is slow.  Slopes range from 1 to 10 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 360 mm, and the average annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Typic Durixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Budlewis silt loam -- on a 2 percent slope under rangeland vegetation at 1,710 meter elevation. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on August 10, 1982, the soil was dry throughout.)

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Forvic, Hatpeak, Manard, Oshone (T), Peevywell, and Rastus series.  Forvic soils have a 50 to 75 cm thick mollic epipedon, and average 50 to 59 percent clay in the control section.  Hatpeak, Oshone, Peevywell, and Rastus soils are more than 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Manard soils have a 18 to 25 cm thick mollic epipedon, and lack a Bk horizon above the duripan.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Budlewis soils are on terraces, calderas, foothills, structural benches, and tablelands.  The slope ranges from 1 to 10 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium and loess from mixed sources, and residuum from basalt.  Elevations are 5,000 to 1,925 meters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 300 to 410 mm.  The average annual temperature is 5.0 to 7.8 degrees C.  The frost free season is 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chayson, Howcree, and Tanner soils.  Chayson and Tanner soils occur on elevated areas on the same landscape.  Chayson soils are fine-loamy. Tanner soils do not have an abrupt textural change between the A and B horizon.  Howcree soils occur on higher terraces, are very deep, and are clayey-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained, slow through medium runoff; slow hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Budlewis soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is low sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, and Sandberg bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Budlewis soils are of moderate extent in southern Idaho. MLRA 25.

REMARKS:  Base saturation:  0-10 cm - 77 percent; 10-28 cm - 83 percent; 28-48 cm - 83 percent.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - surface to 28 cm (the A and Bt1 horizons).
Argillic horizon - from 10 to 69 cm (the Bt1, Bt2, and Btk horizons).
Calcic horizon - from 48 to 79 cm (the Btk and Bk horizons).
Duripan - from 79 to 91 inches (Bkqm horizon).
Lithic contact - The boundary at 91 cm (R layer).

Particle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 60 cm (Bt1, Bt2 and part of the BTK horizons).

This soil approaches an abrupt textural change at the top of the argillic but data indicates it does not qualify.
