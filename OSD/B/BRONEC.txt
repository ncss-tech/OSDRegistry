BRONEC SERIES 

The Bronec series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, slide deposits and tertiary fill material. These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans, fan remnants, hills, mountain slopes, escarpments, landslides and debris flows. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Amesha and Riverrun soils. The Amesha soils are coarse-loamy and the Riverrun soils are sandy-skeletal.  These soils occur on similar landforms as the Bronec soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Bronec soils are used for irrigated and nonirrigated cropland and for rangeland. The potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, blue grama, needleandthread, fringed sagewort, big sagebrush, and rubber rabbitbrush. Some areas have a thin overstory of Douglas-fir and limber pine and an understory of bluebunch wheatgrass, blue grama, big sagebrush, and Rocky Mountain juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Bronec soils are of moderate extent in the intermountain valleys of southwestern Montana. MLRAs - 43B and 44B.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Jefferson County, Montana, 1998.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 7 inches, mixed (A, Bk1 horizons)
Calcic horizon from 9 to 35 inches (Bk2, Bk3, Bk4 horizons)
