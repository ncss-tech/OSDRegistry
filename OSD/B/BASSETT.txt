BASSETT SERIES

The Bassett series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in 30 to 75 centimeters of silty or loamy sediments and the underlying till. These soils are on interfluves and side slopes on dissected till plains on the Iowan Erosion Surface. Slope ranges from 2 to 35 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 885 millimeters.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Iowa County, Iowa, 1965.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 43 to 93 centimeters (2Bt1, 2Bt2 and 2Bt3 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (Ap, BE, 2Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3, and 2BC horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 23 centimeters (Ap horizon);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 43 to 117 centimeters (2Bt1, 2Bt2, and 2Bt3 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Not all pedons meet the requirements of an argillic horizon (1.2 times clay increase from BE horizon to 2Bt horizon). In these cases, the plow layer (Ap horizon) extends to the argillic horizon without transitional layers.

Some pedons have vertical seams or wedges of sand or loamy sand about 5 to 15 centimeters wide and about 0.9 to 1.2 meters deep extending downward from the stone line into the till.

Mollic subgroup based on colors and thickness of the ochric epipedon.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
