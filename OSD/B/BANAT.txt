BANAT SERIES

The Banat series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loamy deposits and the underlying stratified, calcareous sand to very gravelly coarse sand, on outwash plains, valley trains, and stream terraces.  These soils have moderate permeability in the loamy material and very rapid permeability in the underlying material. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, active, frigid Aeric Endoaqualfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Banat silt loam on a nearly level forested area. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Oa--0 to 3 inches; black (10YR 2/1) well decomposed organic material; moderate fine granular structure; friable; many fine and very fine roots; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 5 inches thick)

   A--3 to 6 inches; black (10YR 2/1) silt loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; strong fine granular structure; friable; many coarse, medium, fine, and very fine roots; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick)

   E/B--6 to 9 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) silt loam; fine prominent pockets of black (10YR 2/1) A material and distinct pockets of strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) B material comprise approximately 30 percent of the horizon volume; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine platy; friable; few coarse and medium and common fine roots; 7 percent pebbles and cobbles; neutral; clear broken boundary.  (0 to 4 inches thick)

   Bt1--9 to 12 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) loam; common medium faint strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few medium and fine roots; common faint and distinct clay films on ped faces; 10 percent pebbles; slightly alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)

   2Bt2--12 to 15 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) very gravelly sandy loam; few medium faint strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) and few fine distinct brown (7.5YR 5/2) mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few faint clay films on ped faces and common faint clay bridges between sand grains; 51 percent pebbles and cobbles; slightly alkaline; gradual; wavy boundary.  (4 to 6 inches thick)

   2Bt3--15 to 25 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand; few medium distinct yellowish red (5YR 5/6) and strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) mottles; single grain; loose; few faint clay bridges between sand grains and few faint clay coatings and stains around sand grains; 73 percent pebbles and cobbles; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline, gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 10 inches thick)

   2C--25 to 63 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) extremely gravelly coarse sand; single grain; loose; 74 percent pebbles and cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Menominee County, Michigan; about 7 miles west and 2 miles north of Daggett; 2,150 feet west and 2,400 feet north of the southeast corner of sec. 19, T. 36 N., R. 25 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 13 to 30 inches.  Reaction of the solum ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline.  Volume of pebbles range from 0 to 15 percent in the A, E, and Bt1 horizons and from 25 to 80 percent in the 2Bt2, 2Bt3, and 2C horizons.  Volume of coarse fragments over 3 inches range from 0 to 5 percent in the A, E, and Bt1 horizons and from 0 to 10 percent in the 2Bt2, 2Bt3, and 2C horizons.

The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or is neutral; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or mucky analogues of these textures.  Some areas have an Ap horizon.

The E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The E/B horizon has characteristics similar to the E and Bt horizons.

The Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or gravelly analogues of these textures.  The 2Bt horizon has similar hue, value, and chroma, but has textures that are very gravelly loam, very gravelly fine sandy loam, or very gravelly sandy loam.  The 2Bt3 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is very gravelly or extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand or very gravelly loamy sand.

The 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is very gravelly or extremely gravelly coarse sand, very gravelly sand, coarse sand, or sand.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  Closely related soils are the Lunds and Nadeau series. Lunds soils do not have argillic horizons.  Nadeau soils do not have low chroma mottles in the argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Banat soils are on outwash plains, valley trains, and terraces of Wisconsinan age.  Slope gradient ranges from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 41 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 32 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the well drained Nadeau soils and somewhat excessively drained Mancelona soils on uplands.  The poorly drained Minocqua soils are on lower depressional areas.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  Surface runoff is slow.  Permeability is moderate in the loamy material and very rapid in the underlying material.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are in woodland.  Red maple, paper birch, sugar maple, quaking aspen, balsam fir, eastern hemlock, white spruce, eastern white pine, black ash, and northern white cedar are the main species.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The Upper Peninsula of Michigan and northeastern Wisconsin.  The series is of small extent.
