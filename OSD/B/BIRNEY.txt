BIRNEY SERIES 

The Birney series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or alluvium derived from semiconsolidated interbedded sandstone and hard shale.  These soils are on sedimentary plains, hills, stream terraces, escarpments and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 45 degrees. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Birney channery loam, grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted) 

    A--0 to 5 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) channery loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak thick platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; 15 percent hard shale and sandstone channers; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick) 

    Bw--5 to 11 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) channery loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine crumbs; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 20 percent hard shale and sandstone fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 10 inches thick) 

    Bk1--11 to 29 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) extremely channery sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots matted around coarse fragments; common to many distinct lime casts on underside of rock fragments; 65 percent hard shale and sandstone fragments; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 30 inches thick) 

    Bk2--29 to 60 inches; reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) extremely channery sandy loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; common to many distinct lime casts on undersides of coarse fragments; 65 percent hard shale and sandstone fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 

Landform - sedimentary plains; hills; escarpments; alluvial fans and stream terraces. 

Elevation - 1,900 to 5,200 feet. 

Slope - 0 to 70 percent. 

Parent material - alluvium or colluvium derived from semiconsolidated interbedded sandstone and shale. 

Climate - long cold winters; moist springs; warm summers. 

Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 15 inches. 

Mean annual air temperature - 40 to 45 degrees F. 

Frost-free period - 95 to 135 days. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Birney soils are used mainly for rangeland;  a few areas are used for woodland.   Potential vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, western wheatgrass, needleandthread, little bluestem, sideoats grama, blue grama, some forbs, and shrubs.  Some areas have a thin stand of ponderosa pine and juniper. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Birney soils are of moderate extent in southeastern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Stillwater County, Montana, 1975. 

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations records:  MT0166, MT1055.  

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 7 inches (after mixing) (A and Bw horizons); cambic horizon - the zone from 5 to 11 inches (Bw horizons); accumulations of secondary calcium carbonates - the zone from 11 to 60 inches (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons); particle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches (Bw, Bk1 and Bk2 horizons).  The Birney soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
