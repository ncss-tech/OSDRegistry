BADRIVER SERIES 

The Badriver series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained and poorly drained soils formed in clayey till. These soils are on flats and in depressions and drainageways on till plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 810 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

Herbster--have a clay content of less than 35 percent in the lower third of the series control section
McQuade--do not have carbonates within a depth of 125 centimeters

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--clayey till
Landform--flats and in depressions and drainageways on till plains
Slope--0 to 3 percent
Elevation--185 to 425 meters
Mean annual air temperature--4 to 6 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation--685 to 940 millimeters
Frost-free period--125 to 190 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Allendale, Odanah, and Sanborg soils.
Allendale--are on landscape positions similar to those of Badriver soils and have a sand content that averages more than 70 percent in the upper half of the particle-size control section
Odanah--are on higher landscape positions and do not have a frequently saturated zone within a depth of 1.8 meters during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Sanborg--are on slightly higher landscape positions and have a frequently saturated zone between depths of 0.3 and 1.0 meter during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of 30 year mean of annual precipitation

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--somewhat poorly and poorly drained--these soils are frequently saturated from the surface of the soil to a depth of 0.6 meter during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of 30 year mean of annual precipitation, this saturation is considered perched Saturated hydraulic conductivity--0.10 to 10.00 micrometers per second

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are forested.  Some areas are cultivated or pastured. The principal crops are oats, timothy, bromegrass, reed canarygrass, alfalfa, and trefoil.  Many areas which were formerly cropland are now idle and reverting to natural vegetation.  The native vegetation is mixed deciduous and coniferous forest.  Common trees species are red maple, balsam fir, quaking aspen, paper birch, and willow.  Common understory species are speckled alder, redosier dogwood, black snakeroot, wild sarsaparilla, and bracken fern. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Physiographic division--Laurentian Upland
Physiographic Province--Superior Upland
MLRA--Superior Lake Plain (92)
LRR K; northwestern Wisconsin and northeastern Minnesota

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Bayfield County, Wisconsin, 2005.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 75 centimeters; series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon: 
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 25 centimeters (A and E/B horizons); 
glossic horizon--the zone from a depth of 8 to 61 centimeters (E/B and B/E horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 25 to 135 centimeters (B/E, Btk1, and Btk2 horizons);
aquic moisture regime.

The intense reddish colors inherent in the parent material often mask the redoximorphic features and make taxonomic classification difficult.  

Water table studies in this soil (and associated soils) were used to classify this series.

Badriver soils react positively to the alpha, alpha-dipyridyl at some time during saturation.

Cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data (NSSL).
