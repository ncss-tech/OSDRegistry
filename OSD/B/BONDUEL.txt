BONDUEL SERIES


The Bonduel series consists of somewhat poorly drained soils that are moderately deep to a lithic contact with dolomite bedrock. These soils formed in loamy till underlain by dolomite on ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, frigid Aquollic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Bonduel loam - on a 1 percent slope in a cultivated field at an elevation of about 236 meters (774 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

	Ap--0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 inches); very dark gray (10YR 3/1) loam, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; moderate medium granular structure; friable; many roots; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. [15 to 23 cm (6 to 9 inches) thick]

	BE--20 to 36 cm (8 to 14 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; many roots; common medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; few fine distinct pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) iron depletions in the matrix; slightly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. [0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 inches) thick]

	Bt1--36 to 51 cm (14 to 20 inches); brown (7.5YR 5/4) loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; many roots; few distinct clay films on faces of peds; common medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; common medium distinct pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) iron depletions in the matrix; about 2 percent gravel; slightly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.

	Bt2--51 to 64 cm (20 to 25 inches); brown (7.5YR 5/4) loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few faint clay films on faces of peds; common medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) masses of iron accumulation in the matrix; common medium distinct pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) iron depletions in the matrix; about 5 percent dolomitic gravel; slightly alkaline; clear irregular boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bt horizons ranges from 15 to 53 cm (6 to 21 inches).]

	C--64 to 94 cm (25 to 37 inches); light brown (7.5YR 6/4) loam; massive; friable; common medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; few medium distinct pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) iron depletions in the matrix; about 5 percent dolomitic gravel; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary. [0 to 38 cm (0 to 15 inches) thick]

	2R--94 to 152 cm (37 to 60 inches); gray (10YR 6/1) dolomite bedrock; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bonduel soils are on concave or plane slopes and depressions on ground moraines underlain by dolomite. Slope  ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Bonduel soils formed in loamy till over dolomite. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 710 to 840 mm (28 to 33 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 4.4 to 7.2 degrees C (40 to 45 degrees F). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kolberg, Longrie, and Namur soils. The Kolberg soils are nearby in better drained positions where the argillic horizon averages more than 35 percent clay. The Longrie soils are also nearby in better drained positions, but are coarse-loamy. The Namur soils are nearby where the depth to bedrock is less than 31 cm (12 inches).

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. The potential for surface runoff ranges from negligible to moderate. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the till and ranges from moderately low to high (0.42 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the bedrock. Permeability is moderate in the till and ranges from moderate to slow in the bedrock. These soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 31 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) for some time in most years

USE AND VEGETATION: Many areas of this soil have  been cleared and are used for cropland.  Common crops are corn, small grains and hay. Some areas are used for pastureland or woodland. Native vegetation is commonly mixed deciduous and coniferous forest.  Common trees are quacking aspen, paper birch, red maple, and some northern white-cedar.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 94A, 94B, and 95A in northeastern Wisconsin and northern lower Michigan. These soils are of moderate extent.
