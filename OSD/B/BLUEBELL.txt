BLUEBELL SERIES

The Bluebell series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basalt.  Bluebell soils are on mountain slopes and plateaus.  Slopes are 5 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 685 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Demast and Ticanot soils. Demast soils are very deep and occur on concave mountainsides and lower slopes. Ticanot soils are shallow to a lithic contact and are on convex positions on mountainsides.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow to rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Bluebell soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. These soils support a forest canopy of ponderosa pine with an understory of mountain big sagebrush, Idaho fescue, and arrowleaf balsamroot.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Idaho, MLRA 43B. These soils are moderately extensive.  

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: BOZEMAN, MONTANA

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Modoc County (Surprise Valley-Home Camp Area), California, 1971.

REMARKS:  The revision of February 2004 changed the typical pedon and moved the type location from Modoc County, California to Elko County, Nevada.  The original type location in Modoc County, California was reexamined by field soil scientists in 2003.  The Bluebell soils in the Surprise Valley-Home Camp Area soil survey has been determined to be very deep, ashy-skeletal, and is now correlated to the tentative Cowbell series. 

The revision of March 2014 correlated the Bluebell series mapped in MLRA 25 (Duck Valley Area, ID677) to the Rutherford series. The remaining Bluebell soils are mapped only in MLRA 43B.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - the zone from 3 to 64cm (A1, A2, AB and Bt horizons)
Argillic horizon - the zone from 48 to 64cm (Bt horizon)
Lithic contact - the zone starting at 64cm (R horizon)
Particle size control section - the zone from 48 to 64 cm (Bt horizon)

Bluebell soils have a cryic temperature regime and a xeric moisture regime.
