Indian River soils--have siliceous mineralogy; mesic soil temperature regime; and are very close equivalents to Bastropbay
Massapog and Rhodesfolly soils--have mesic soil temperature regime and buried former soil surface horizons
Nagunt soils--have mesic soil temperature regime; sulfidic materials, and buried former soil surface horizons

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--Sandy lagoonal deposits
Landscape--Coastal estuaries and lagoons

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: SPECIAL PROJECTS OFFICE

SERIES PROPOSED: Brazoria County, Texas, 2021. The name is coined from Bastrop Bay.

REMARKS: The series was formerly included with water.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are--
Particle-size control section--0 to 100 cm (0 to 40 in)
Ochric epipedon--0 to 46 cm (0 to 18 in) (Ag horizon)
Peraquic feature--0 to 203 cm (0 to 80 in) (Ag horizon and Cg layers are permanently saturated)

Additional Comments--Mineralogy based on data from adjacent subaerial barrier island soils and the content of shell fragments that make up the sand portion.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Soil survey office lab data on pedon S2021TX0399124 from series type location.
