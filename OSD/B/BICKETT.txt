BICKETT SERIES



The Bickett series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils

that formed in material derived from herbaceous plants over alluvium.

Permeability is moderately slow.  These soils are on flood plains and

have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about

14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid Histic Humaquepts



TYPICAL PEDON:  Bickett mucky peat on a nearly level flood plain at an

elevation of 4,820 feet in pastureland.  Soil was wet throughout when

described on July 11, 1982.  (Colors are for moist soil unless

otherwise noted.)



    Oek1--0 to 3 inches; black (10YR 2/1) mucky peat, dark gray (10YR

4/1) dry; about 50 percent fibers, about 25 percent fibers after

rubbing; many very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine

and fine interstitial pores; slight effervescence (5 percent calcium

carbonate); neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (1 to 5 inches

thick)



    Oek2--3 to 6 inches; black (N 2/0) mucky peat (N 2/0) dry; about 50

percent fibers, about 20 percent after rubbing; many very fine, fine,

medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores;

slight effervescence (5 percent calcium carbonate); mildly alkaline (pH

7.4); clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 7 inches thick)



    Oak--6 to 11 inches; black (10YR 2/1) muck, gray (10YR5/1) dry;

about 40 percent fibers, about 10 percent after rubbing; many very

fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine

interstitial pores; slight effervescence (5 percent calcium carbonate);

mildly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)



    2Bkgl--11 to 24 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/1) silty clay

loam, light gray (2.5Y 7/1) dry; massive; very hard, very firm, very

sticky and very plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; few

very fine and fine tubular pores; strong effervescence (15 percent

calcium carbonate); mildly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary.

(3 to 17 inches thick)



    2Bkg2--24 to 40 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/1) silty clay

loam, light gray (2.5Y 7/1) dry; massive; very hard, firm, very sticky

and very plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine and

fine tubular pores; strong effervescence (15 percent calcium

carbonate); 5 percent pebbles; mildly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy

boundary.  (13 to 17 inches thick)



    3Cg--40 to 61 inches; dark gray (5Y 4/1) loam, gray (5Y 6/1) dry;

massive; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few very fine and fine roots;

few very fine and fine tubular pores; 10 percent pebbles; neutral (pH

7.0).



TYPE LOCATION:  Blaine County, Idaho, about 3 miles south of Gannett;

500 feet east and 200 feet north of the southwest corner of section 23,

T. 1 S., R. 19 E.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in this family, a

similar soil is the DeVoignes series.  DeVoignes soils are

noncalcareous in some part of the family control section, are poorly

drained, and have strata of organic material in the 10 to 40 inch

layer.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bickett soils are on flood plains.  Slopes range

from 0 to 2 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,700 to 5,000 feet.  The

soil formed in alluvium and material derived from herbaceous plants.

The annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, most of which falls as

snow and early spring rain.  The annual air temperature is about 40 to

44 degrees F.  The frost free season is 60 to 90 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Adamson, Balaam,

Bruneel, Hapur, and Picabo soils.  All these soils lack a histic

epipedon.  Adamson soils are coarse loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal

in the control section and are on low fan terraces.  Balaam soils are

sandy skeletal in the control section and are on low fan terraces.

Bruneel soils are coarse loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal in the

control section and are on flood plains.  Hapur soils are fine loamy in

the control section and are on flood plains.  Picabo soils are coarse

silty in the control section and are on alluvial terraces.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained; runoff is very slow or

ponded; permeability is moderately slow.  These soils are continually

flooded from September to May.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for wildlife habitat.  Some areas are

used for pasture during nonflooded periods.  Vegetation is Nebraska

sedge, redtop, rushes, and cattails.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South central Idaho.  The series is

inextensive.
