BECIDA SERIES

The Becida series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in loamy lodgment till of the Wadena Lobe of the late Wisconsin glaciation.  These soils are on linear or slightly concave toeslopes of drumlins and moraines.  These soils are deep to a densic contact.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 720 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Otter Tail County, Minnesota, 1996.

REMARKS:  
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 33 to 83 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 183 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 33 centimeters (Ap and Eg horizons); 
albic horizon--the zone from 20 to 33 centimeters (Eg horizon); 
glossic horizon--the zone from 33 to 69 centimeters; (E/B horizon); 
argillic horizon--the zone from 33 to 147 centimeters (Bt horizon); 
densic contact--the zone starting at a depth of 147 centimeters;
base saturation--greater than 60 percent;
aquic conditions--within 50 centimeters of the soil surface;
redoximorphic features--between depths of 20 and 183 centimeters;
mollic subgroup--dark colors of Ap horizon

The dense till has repetitive fracturing that affects water movement and root penetration.  This does affect the behavior of the soil.  A proposal to recognize the fracturing has been suggested in the past.  Also, the type and amount of redoximorphic features in the dense till may be directly related to the fracturing.

Previously this soil was included with the Paddock soils.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  
Pedon S1995MN111001 is the typical pedon. 
Laboratory data--KSSL pedon 81MN153004 was sampled as a poorly drained Paddock and has been correlated to Becida series; pedon S1981MN153-004 (3511) has accompanying University of Minnesota lab data.
