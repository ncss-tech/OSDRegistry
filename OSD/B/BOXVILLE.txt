BOXVILLE SERIES

The Boxville series consist of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in loamy and clayey materials of Pleistocene age.  These very gently sloping to sloping soils are on smooth, slightly convex side slopes of forested terraces in the Western Coastal Plains (MLRA 133B).  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 47 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 67 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, thermic Typic Paleudalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Boxville fine sandy loam--pasture.
   (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

      Ap--0 to 8 inches; dark brown (10YR 4/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; moderate fine granular structure; hard, friable; many fine roots, medium acid, abrupt wavy boundary. (6 to 14 inches thick)

      Bt1--8 to 19 inches; red (2.5YR 4/6) clay, red (2.5YR 5/6) dry; moderate fine blocky and subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm; common fine roots; common shiny surfaces on faces of peds; strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (6 to 20 inches thick)

      Bt2--19 to 35 inches; red (2.5YR 4/6) clay, red (2.5YR 5/6) dry; moderate fine blocky structure; very hard, very firm; few fine roots; common shiny surfaces on faces of peds; common slickensides with few intersecting; common manganese and iron concretions; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (12 to 20 inches thick)

      Bt3--35 to 57 inches; red (2.5YR 4/6) clay, red (2.5YR 5/6) dry; moderate fine blocky structure; very hard, very firm; few fine roots; few shiny surfaces on faces of peds; few manganese and iron concretions; few calcium carbonate concretions; calcareous in seams below 44 inches, neutral; gradual smooth boundary.  (12 to 30 inches thick)

      BC--57 to 70 inches; red (2.5YR 4/6) silty clay and soft shale, red (2.5YR 5/6) dry with few fine prominent gray mottles in lower part; weak medium blocky structure; very hard, very firm; few iron and manganese concretions, few calcium carbonate concretions; calcareous, moderately alkaline.

 TYPE LOCATION:  Bryan County, Oklahoma; about 10 miles south of Boswell; 1890 feet east and 20 feet south of the northwest corner of sec. 33, T. 6 S., R. 14 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 inches to more than 80 inches.  Depth to soft carbonates ranges from 36 to more than 80 inches.

The Ap horizon or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is a fine sandy loam or loam and ranges from strongly acid through slightly acid.

The Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 6 to 8.  Grayish mottles occur below depths of 30 inches in some pedons.  The Bt horizon is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  The Bt1 horizon or Bt2 horizon ranges from very strong acid through slightly acid.  The Bt3 horizon ranges from medium acid through moderately alkaline. Some pedons do not have intersecting slickensides.

The BC horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 to 8.  It is silty clay, clay, or clay loam and contains soft shale fragments. Reaction ranges from medium acid through moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Braxton of the same family.  Braxton soils have less than 60 percent base saturation in the argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils occur on very gently sloping through sloping stream terraces in the forested Western Coastal Plains.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  They formed in loamy and clayey sediments of Pleistocene age.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 62 degrees to 72 degrees F., average annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 55 inches; Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from about 64 to 80.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Karma and Okay soils on lower terraces and Muskogee soils on higher terraces.  These soils have an argillic horizon with less than 35 percent clay.  Okay soils have a mollic epipedon; Karma soils do not have horizons containing carbonates, and Muskogee soils have grayish mottles in the upper 30 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for bermudagrass pasture.  Some areas are cultivated to wheat, soybeans, grain sorghum, peanuts, and cotton.  Native vegetation is mixed oaks with an understory of grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mainly on intermediate terraces adjacent to the Red River.  These soils are moderately extensive.
