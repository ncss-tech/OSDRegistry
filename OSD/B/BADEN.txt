BADEN SERIES

The Baden series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in a mantle of loamy glaciolacustrine or glaciofluvial deposits and the underlying firm loamy till on lake washed till plains, till plains and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 711 millimeters.
