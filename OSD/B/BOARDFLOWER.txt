BOARDFLOWER SERIES

The Boardflower series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountains.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary rock with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface.  Slopes are 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Vitrandic Haploxeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Boardflower loam - on a 7 percent slope, woodland.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--2 inches to 0 ; organic layer of needles and twigs.

    A--0 to 8 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/3) dry; moderate medium platy structure parting to moderate medium granular; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine, fine, medium and coarse irregular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 12 inches thick)

   BA--8 to 25 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/3) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine, fine, medium and coarse irregular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual smooth boundary. (8 to 18 inches thick)

    Bt1--25 to 34 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) clay loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/3) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine, fine, medium and few coarse roots; common very fine, fine and few medium tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (6 to 10 inches thick)

    2Bt2--34 to 60 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) clay, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) dry; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots along faces of peds; few very fine, fine and medium tubular pores; continuous prominent clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; neutral (pH 7.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Wasco County, Oregon, 500 feet east and 2000 feet north of the SW corner of section 26, T.6 S., R.11 E. (Latitude 45 degrees, 01 minutes, 06 seconds N, Longitude 121 degrees, 23 minutes, 57 seconds W) Warm Springs Indian Reservation.

RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days within the four months that follow the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  Depth to sedimentary bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Depth to the discontinuity is 25 to 35 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 45 percent field estimated clay and 0 to 10 percent gravel.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.

The A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It contains 0 to 10 percent gravel.  It has an estimated 40 to 60 percent volcanic glass and 0.4 to 1.0 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron.

The Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is 15 to 25 percent clay and contains 0 to 10 percent gravel.  It has an estimated 10 to 30 percent volcanic glass and 0.15 to 0.35 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron.

The Bt1 horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam with 30 to 40 percent clay.  It contains 0 to 10 percent gravel.

The 2Bt2 horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is clay or silty clay with 40 to 50 percent clay and contains 0 to 5 percent gravel.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Littlefawn (T) series.  Littlefawn soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Boardflower soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep side slopes of mountains.  The soil formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary rock with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface.  Slopes are 2 to 20 percent.  Elevation ranges from 2600 to 3500 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool and wet winters and hot and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 49 degrees F. The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bodell, Jorn, Fawnsprings, Littlefawn and Yawkola soils.  Bodell soils are loamy-skeletal, shallow to bedrock and on adjacent south facing side slopes.  Jorn soils are moderately deep to bedrock and are on adjacent south-facing side slopes.  Fawnsprings soils are deep to bedrock and on north-facing side slopes of mountains.  Littlefawn soils are moderately deep to bedrock and are on north-facing side slopes of mountains.  Yawkola soils are clayey-skeletal and are on adjacent south-facing side slopes of mountains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is slow.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is Ponderosa pine, Oregon white oak and Douglas fir with an understory of common snowberry, lupine and western fescue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Oregon; MLRA 6.  The soils of this series are not extensive.
