BLISSHILL SERIES

The Blisshill series consists of deep to a duripan, well drained soils in concave areas on basalt plateaus and mesas.  Blisshill soils formed in weathered loess.  Permeability is slow.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Vertic Haploxeralfs

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Papeek series.  Papeek soils lack a duripan.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Blisshill soils are in concave areas on basalt plateaus and mesas.  Blisshill soils are underlain by basalt and formed in weathered loess.  Slopes are 1 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 3,900 to 5,200 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 11 to 13 inches but these soils received additional moisture from runon from surrounding areas.  The average annual air temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F. and the frost free period is 85 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bray soils  on convex interfluves and mounds.  Bray soils do not crack.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; runoff is rapid; permeability is slow.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Blisshill soils are used for rangeland.  Potential native vegetation is low sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Blisshill soils are of small extent in south central Idaho.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Gooding County, Idaho, 1993.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 2 inches (A horizon)

Argillic horizon - the zone from 2 to 34 inches (BAtss, Btss1, and Btss2 horizons)

Duripan - the zone from 42 to 60 inches (2Bqm horizon)

Some duripans have slight calcium carbonate cementation in addition to silica.

The particle-size control section - the zone from 2 inches to 22 inches (BAtss and part of the Btss1 horizons)

ADDITIONAL DATA:  The soil survey sample numbers are S91ID-063-018 to 021 for partial laboratory data.
