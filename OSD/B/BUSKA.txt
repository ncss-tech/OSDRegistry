BUSKA SERIES

The Buska series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum from micaceous metamorphic rocks on mountains. They have moderate saturated hydraulic conductivity. Slopes range from 2 to 80 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C, and the mean annual precipitation is about 610 mm.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, micaceous, frigid Glossic Hapludalfs
 
TYPICAL PEDON: Buska silt loam, on a southwest facing, convex slope of 17 percent, under a ponderosa pine forest at an elevation of about 1,786 meters. When described on August 5, 1975, the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

(20 to 50 cm thick)

    Bt/E--40 to 53 cm; about 90 percent dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry (Bt part), and about 10 percent dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry (E part) channery silt loam; weak thick platy structure parting to weak fine and medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and coarse roots; many fine pores; about 25 percent strongly cemented, flat angular fragments of schist; neutral; gradual wavy boundary.

    Bt2--71 to 96 cm; very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) very channery silt loam,dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) dry; weak coarse and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and coarse roots; common fine pores; about 45 percent flat angular fragments of schist; neutral; gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 25 to 76 cm)

    BC--96 to 109 cm; very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) very channery silt loam, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) dry; weak coarse prismatic structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few fine and coarse roots; common fine pores; about 50 percent flat angular fragments of schist; rock structure evident; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 18 cm thick)

    C--109 to 152 cm; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) very channery silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) dry; massive; about 10 percent light olive gray (5Y 6/2) iron stains inherent from the schist; hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine pores; about 80 percent flat angular fragments of schist; rock structure evident; very slight effervescence; neutral.
 
TYPE LOCATION: Lawrence County, South Dakota; about 3.3 km (2 miles) east and 20.9 km (13 miles) south of Lead; 350 meters east and 732 meters north of the southwest corner of Sec. 2, T. 2 N., R. 3 E.; Minnesota Ridge quadrangle; 44 degrees 9 minutes 19.4 seconds north latitude, 103 degrees 43 minutes 47.7 seconds west longitude, NAD 83.
 
RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

The Bt/E horizon has properties similar to its respective parts. It is typically greater than 85 percent Bt horizon material.

Coarse fragments: 35 to 80 percent flat angular or subangular fragments of schist of which over 40 percent are strongly cemented and over 10 percent are weakly cemented; 0 to 15 percent nonflat, subangular or subrounded, gravel and/or cobbles of quartzite and other metamorphic rocks
Reaction: moderately acid to slightly alkaline.
 
COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.
 
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: residuum or colluvium over residuum derived from micaceous schist
Landform: ridges, ridge shoulders and hillslopes of mountains
Slopes: 2 to 80 percent
Elevation: 1,280 to 1,890 meters 
Mean annual air temperature: 4 to 7 degrees C 
Mean annual precipitation: 558 to 762 mm
Precipitation pattern: over one-half the mean annual precipitation falls as snow and rain during the period March through July
Frost-free season: 60 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Citadel, Grizzly, Hisega,Pactola, and Virkula soils. The Citadel soils have smectitic mineralogy and the Grizzly, Pactola, and Virkula soils have mixed mineralogy. In addition:

Citadel are fine textured and formed in material from limestone; generally they occur on lower parts of the landscape
Grizzly formed in material derived from igneous rocks; they occur on similar landscape positions
Hisega have mollic epipedons and lack argillic horizons; they occur on similar landscape positions
Pactola occur on similar landscape positions
Virkula are fine-silty; generally they occur on lower parts of the landscape.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately-low and moderately-high; runoff is low to very high, depending on slope.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for timber production, recreation and wildlife, and grazing. Native vegetation is dominantly ponderosa pine with lesser amounts of Black Hills spruce, aspen, and birch. Understory vegetation is sparse to abundant depending on aspect and the overstory canopy coverage. It consists ofvarious forbs, shrubs, and grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Crystalline Area - Metamorphic physiographic area of the Black Hills in western South Dakota; LRR G, MLRA 62. The Buska series is of small extent.

Taxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010.  The mineralogy class was changed from paramicaceous to micaceous in 07/2010 by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the responsible MLRA regional office. The change was necessary based on the eleventh edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2010.
