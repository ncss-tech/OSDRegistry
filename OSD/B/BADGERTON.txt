BADGERTON SERIES

The Badgerton series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  These soils form on stream terraces and flood plains on fan remnants.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 405 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Pachic Haplocryolls
 
TYPICAL PEDON: Badgerton loam on a 1 percent slope on a stream terrace at an elevation of 1871 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.) 

	A--0 to 23 cm; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR4/2) dry; strong fine and medium granular structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; many very fine tubular and irregular pores; 10 percent fine rounded gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (23 to 37 cm thick)

	AB--23 to 43 cm; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) dry; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine, and medium, and few coarse roots; common very fine tubular and many very fine irregular pores; 35 percent rounded gravel and 5 percent rounded cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 37 cm thick)

	BC--43 to 78 cm; dark brown (10YR 3/3) extremely gravelly loamy sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine, fine, and coarse, and common very coarse roots; many interstitial pores; 54 percent medium and coarse rounded gravel and 6 percent fine rounded gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.

	C2--108 to 152 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; single grain; loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; many interstitial pores; 30 percent medium and coarse rounded gravel, 5 percent fine rounded gravel and 15 percent rounded cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).
