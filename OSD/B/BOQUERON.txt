BOQUERON SERIES

The Boqueron series consist of very deep, very poorly drained, slowly permeable soils in tidal marshes and flats.  They formed in clayey alluvial and marine sediments.  Near the type location, the mean air temperature is about 79 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, mixed, superactive, nonacid, isohyperthermic Vertic Fluvaquents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Boqueron muck.  (Colors are for moist soil.)

     Oa--0 to 2 inches; very dark gray (2.5Y 3/1) muck; about 60 percent fiber, by volume, unrubbed and about 15 percent fiber, by volume, rubbed; weak fine granular structure; very friable; nonsticky, nonplastic; many fine and medium roots; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 4 inches thick)

     A--2 to 4 inches; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) silty clay; weak fine granular structure; firm, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common fine roots; common medium faint olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) iron accumulations along root channels; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary. (1 to 4 inches thick)

     Cg1--4 to 8 inches; 50 percent black (N 2.5/) and 50 percent very dark gray (N 3/) mucky clay loam; massive; firm, sticky, plastic; few fine roots; about 5 percent, by volume, shell fragments; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary. 

     Cg2--8 to 12 inches; dark gray (N 4/) silty clay; massive; firm, sticky, plastic; common medium prominent red (2.5YR 4/8) and yellowish red (5YR 5/8) masses of iron accumulation; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary. 

     Cg3--12 to 55 inches; dark gray (N 4/) silty clay; massive; firm, sticky plastic; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary. 

     Cg4--55 to 80 inches; greenish gray (10Y 5/1) clay; massive; firm, sticky, plastic; common medium distinct olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) masses of iron accumulation; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Cabo Rojo Municipality, Puerto Rico.  Refugio de Aves de Boqueron; approximately 0.9 mile southwest of Las Arenas, about 1,400 feet west-northwest of road junction, and about 200 feet south of road.  Puerto Real topographic quadrangle; lat. 18 degrees, 01 minute, 10 seconds N.; long. 67 degrees, 09 minutes, 35 seconds W.; PRD 1940.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Reaction is moderately alkaline throughout.  The soil is moderately saline throughout. 

The Oa horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay.  Content of shell fragments ranges from none to common.

The upper part of the Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 2.5 to 5.  Masses of iron accumulation in shades of brown and red range from none to common throughout.  Content of shell fragments ranges from none to common throughout the Cg horizon.  Texture is clay loam, mucky clay loam, or silty clay.  

The lower part of the Cg horizon has hue of 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and value of 1; or it is neutral with value of 4 or 5.  Colors and texture is the same as the upper part.  

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no known competing series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Boqueron soils are in tidal marshes and flats.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  They formed in clayey alluvial and marine sediments.  The climate is tropical semiarid.  The average air temperature ranges from 78 to 80 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 30 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Jaucas, Manglillo, Serrano, and Teresa soils.  Jaucas and Serrano soils are on slightly higher positions.  In addition, Jaucas soils are sandy throughout and Serrano soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Manglillo soils are organic.  Teresa soils are on higher adjacent positions and have clayey particle-size control sections. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of Boqueron soils are used for wildlife refuges.  Vegetation consists primarily of mangrove trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Coastal areas of Puerto Rico.  They are not extensive.
