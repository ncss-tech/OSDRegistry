BAYLOCK SERIES

The Baylock series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in loess or silty alluvium over silty and loamy alluvium.  The Baylock soils are on stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is 15 degrees C, and the mean annual precipitation is 1055 mm.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ginat, Laconia, and Sunken series. The Ginat soils have a shallower argillic horizon and they formed in silty alluvium in the Ohio River drainage basin. Laconia soils have a 2Btg horizon with a higher content of clay and occur in depressions on karst landscapes.  Sunken soils have a 2Btg horizon with a higher content of sand and formed in loamy eolian or alluvial sediments.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Baylock soils are on treads and in depressions of stream terraces in the southeastern Ozarks. They formed in loess or silty alluvium over silty or loamy alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 12 to 16 degrees C., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 965 to 1145 mm. Frost-free days range from 175 to 245. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bearthicket, Cornwall, Jamesfin, Marquand, Tilk soils.  Bearthicket and Jamesfin soils are on similar positions and are well drained.  Cornwall and Marquand soils are on foot slopes or higher terraces and are moderately well drained. Tilk soils are on flood-plain steps and are loamy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained, low runoff, moderate saturated hydraulic conductivity in the upper part of the solum and moderately slow in the lower part. In undrained areas, an intermittent, apparent high water table is at 0 to 1.0 foot below the surface from December through April in most years.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used for hay and pasture, and a few areas are in woodland or brushy idle pasture. Native vegetation is mixed deciduous, hardwood forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Ozarks Missouri; MLRA-116A and 116C. The acreage is of moderate extent in Missouri.
