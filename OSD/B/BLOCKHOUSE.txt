BLOCKHOUSE SERIES

The Blockhouse series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soil formed in alluvium. Blockhouse soils are in swales on footslopes and on broad alluvial plains. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Blockhouse soils are in swales on footslopes and on broad alluvial plains at elevations of 1,600 to 2,200 feet. Slopes are 0 to 10 percent. They formed in alluvium. Summers are warm and dry and winters are cool and moist. The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 18 inches. The average January temperature is 29 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 67 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free season is 120 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Goldendale, Gunn, Lorena, Konert, and Munset soils. The Goldendale soils have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick and are well drained. Gunn soils have an ochric epipedon and are well drained. Lorena soils have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick and have a lithic contact at depth of 20 to 40 inches. Konert soils have an aquic moisture regime and are more than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon.
Munset soils have an aquic moisture regime and have a lithic contact at a depth at 20 to 40 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained; ponded to slow runoff; moderately slow permeability. A seasonal high water table is present with it's highest level occurring between February and April.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for cropland. Small grains, hay and pasture are principle crops. Native vegetation is bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, wild hyacinth, common camas, sedge and willow.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Klickitat County, Washington; MLRA 8. The series is of small extent. The name is from the Village of Blockhouse, Klickitat, Washington.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Klickitat County, Washington, 2003.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to 29 inches with the Bt1 horizon having mollic color but less than 1 percent organic matter.
Argillic horizon - the zone from 12 to 60 inches.
This soil needs more study to see if it is in an Ultic subgroup.
Classification revision 1/98 - classification based on the addition of CEC activity classes in Soil Taxonomy.
