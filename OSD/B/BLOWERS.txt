BLOWERS SERIES

The Blowers series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loamy lodgment till of the Late Wisconsin glaciation.  These soils are on convex and linear slopes on backslopes , and rises of drumlins and moraines.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 680 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Oxyaquic Glossudalfs
