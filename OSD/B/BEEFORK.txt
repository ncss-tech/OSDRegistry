BEEFORK SERIES

The Beefork series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils fed by springs and formed in a mantle of organic material and underlying gravelly to extremely gravelly colluvium and alluvium.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils occur mainly in upland drainageways on terraces, toeslopes and footslopes within the Ozark Highlands.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature is 13 degrees Celsius.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1,067 millimeters.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.    The Kimvar series is in a similar family with a superactive cation-exchange activity class and a fine-loamy particle size class.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--mantle of organic material and underlying extremely to non-gravelly colluvium and alluvium 
Landform terraces, toeslopes, and footslopes of upland drainageways
Slope--0 to 12 percent
Elevation--212 to 323 meters above sea level
Mean annual air temperature--12 to 14 degrees Celsius
Mean annual precipitation--1016 to 1194 millimeters

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Midco, Cedargap, Racoon, Freeburg, Farewell, Rueter, Alred, Bardley, and Moko soils.    The Midco and Cedargap soils are skeletal and occur on floodplains.  They are excessively well drained and well drained.  The Racoon, Freeburg and Farewell soils are fine-silty and fine-loamy and occur on terraces and high floodplains.  They are poorly and somewhat poorly drained.  The Rueter and Alred series are very deep and well drained, loamy-skeletal and loamy-skeletal over clayey, and are on summits, shoulders, and side slopes.  The Bardley series is very fine and moderately deep to dolomite and the Moko series is loamy-skeletal and shallow to dolomite.  They are well drained and occur on summits, shoulders, and side slopes.

Flooding--rare
Ponding--rare

USE AND VEGETATION:
These soils are used primarily for wildlife habitat and pastureland. Native vegetation can range from open to closed fen and marsh consisting of sedges, broadleaf forbs, and wetland shrubs and trees. In pastureland settings these sites are often partially drained and have damaged or removed epipedons.

Physiographic section--Springfield-Salem plateaus
MLRAs--Ozark Highland (116A) and St. Francois Knobs and Basins (116C)

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Histic epipedon: 0 to 36 centimeters (Oe and Oa horizons). 
Mollic epipedon : 36 to 61 centimeters (A horizons).


Beefork soils have been identified in areas mapped as Batcave, Farewell, Deible, Midco, Raftville, Gabriel, Racoon Freeburg, and a variety of other hydric soil series. Argillic horizons, if present, are considered relict and were formed during a previous period of soil formation.

Site and pedon ID 2020M0093101 represents the typical pedon.
