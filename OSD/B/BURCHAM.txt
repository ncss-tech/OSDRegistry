BURCHAM SERIES

The Burcham series consists of very deep, moderately well and somewhat poorly drained soils on nearly level to slightly convex meander scars or escarpments on low intermediate flood plains. These soils formed in 38 to 102 centimeters (15 to 40 inches) of silty alluvium and the underlying clayey alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (about 50 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 737 millimeters (about 29 inches).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty over clayey, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquic Hapludolls

[Combined thickness of the Bg horizon is 18 to 36 centimeters (7 to 14 inches).]
