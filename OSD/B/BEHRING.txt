BEHRING SERIES

The Behring series consists of deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in residuum weathered from mudstone of Tertiary Age.  These nearly level to sloping soils occur on interfluves and side slopes on upland ridges and plains on dissected plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent, but are mostly 2 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 888 mm (35 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 19.7 degrees C (67.5 degrees F).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Caldwell County, Texas; 1972.

REMARKS:  These soils were formerly included in the Heiden series and classified in the Rendzina great soil group.  The classification was changed from Fine, smectitic, thermic Udertic Haplustolls to Fine, smectitic, thermic Udic Haplusterts based on extensive data collection and analysis of laboratory data.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:

Mollic epipedon: 0 to 61 cm (0 to 24 in)  (Ap and A horizons) 
Cambic horizon: 61 to 124 cm (24 to 49 in)  (Bkss and Bk horizons) 
Slickensides (pedongenic): 61 to 97 cm (24 to 38 in)  (Bkss horizon) 
Secondary carbonates: 61 to 152 cm (24 to 80 in)  (Bkss, Bk, and Cdk horizons)
Densic materials: 124 to 203 cm (49 to 80 in)  (Cdk horizon)
