MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Halifax County, Virginia, 2003.

REMARKS: Bentley soils were formerly mapped with the Mattaponi series. The 04/97 relocation of the mesic/thermic soil temperature regime line necessitated the creation of soils that are mesic counterparts within MLRA 136.  These soils are affected by periodic episaturation (seasonally perched water table) at a depth of 2.5 to 3.5 feet below the soil surface. Redoximorphic characteristics and associated aquic conditions are typically too deep for these soils to classify in an "Aquic" subgroup.  It is not uncommon for Bentley soils to include areas of a similar soil that has a pale clay curve.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 and 23 inches (Ap and BA horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 23 and 61 inches (Bt and BCt horizon)
Aquic conditions--periodic saturation and reduction within 30 to 42 inches of the soil surface, and one or more unsaturated layers within 80 inches of the surface, occurring below the periodically saturated zone (episaturation)

Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 61 inches

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Laboratory data from 3 pedons in Halifax County Virginia is available from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Lab #98-41 (5-10); #98-41 (11-16); and #98-41 (17-20)).
