BOTLEG SERIES

The Botleg series consists of very shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in residuum from granite. The Botleg soils are on hills. Slope ranges from 4 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 66 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic, shallow Typic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Botleg extremely gravelly loam, rangeland and wildlife habitat. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The surface is covered by approximately 65 percent pebbles and 3 percent cobbles. 

	A--0 to 2 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) extremely gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine, fine and medium vesicular pores; 65 percent pebbles and 3 percent cobbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick) 

	Bt--2 to 5 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) very gravelly sandy clay loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; common fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on face of peds; 50 percent pebbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick) 

	Btk--5 to 10 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) extremely gravelly sandy clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; few fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on face of peds; few distinct calcium carbonate coats (1 mm) on undersides of rock fragments; 65 percent pebbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear irregular boundary. (2 to 7 inches thick) 

	Crt--10 to 20 inches; highly fractured, partially altered granitic bedrock with clay coats on rock fragments between in fractures. 

TYPE LOCATION: Clark County, Nevada; approximately 3 miles south of the Highway 95 junction with Route 60 located on the west side of the Eldorado Mountains; about 2,400 feet east and 1,570 feet south of the northeast corner of section 10, T. 25 S., R.63 E.; USGS Boulder City SW, NV 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; 35 degrees, 47 minutes, 19 seconds north latitude and 114 degrees, 55 minutes, 37 seconds west longitude; UTM 11s, 687349e, 3962486n; NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil moisture - Usually dry, moist in some part for short periods during winter and early spring and for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July to October following convection storms. Soils have a typic-aridic moisture regime. 

Soil temperature - 67 to 71 degrees F. 

Depth to argillic horizon: 1 to 3 inches. 

Depth to paralithic contact - 6 to 10 inches. 

Control section: Percent clay: Averages 25 to 35 percent. 
Rock fragments: Averages 50 to 70 percent. 

A horizon: Chroma: 3 or 4. 
Effervescence: Strongly effervescent to violently effervescent. 

Btk horizons - Chroma: 4 through 6. 
Percent clay: 27 to 35 percent. 
Rock fragments: 50 to 70 percent.
Texture: Sandy clay loam or clay loam. 
Effervescence: Strongly effervescent to violently effervescent. 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Anklam (AZ), Azure (AZ) and Straycow (NV) series. All of these soils are 10 to 20 inches to paralithic contact. Anklam soils are in the 10 to 13 inch precipitation zone, are moist in the moisture control section more than 20 days cumulative. Azure soils averages 12 to 17 percent clay in the control section, have MAST of 59 to 64 degrees F., mean annual precipitation of 10 to 12 inches and are moist more than 20 days cumulative. Straycow soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 59 to 65 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Botleg soils are on hills. These soils formed in residuum from granite. Slope ranges from 4 to 15 percent. Elevations are 2,000 to 3,900 feet. The climate is hot and arid with warm, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is about 5 to 7 inches, mean annual temperature is about 64 to 69 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 220 to 270 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Seanna series. The Seanna soils do not have an argillic horizon and have less than 19 percent clay in the control section. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; high runoff; moderately slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly white bursage, desert senna and creosotebush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southern Nevada; MLRA 30. These soils are not extensive.
