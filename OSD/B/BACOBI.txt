BACOBI SERIES  

The Bacobi series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits over slope alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks.  Bacobi soils are on plateaus and have slopes of 1 to 7 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haplargids  

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bacobi fine sandy loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(1 to 3 inches thick)  

    Bw--2 to 6 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick)  

    Bt--6 to 15 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; common clay bridging of sand grains, few thin patchy clay films on faces of peds; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 11 inches thick)  

    Btk1--15 to 26 inches; mixed brown (7.5YR 5/4) and dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) and dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm slightly sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common clay bridging of sand grains, few thin patchy clay films on faces of peds; strongly effervescent, common fine rounded lime masses; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 13 inches thick)  

    Btk2--26 to 33 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; common clay bridging of sand grains, few thin patchy clay films on faces of peds; strongly effervescent, common fine rounded lime masses; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 9 inches thick)  

    Bk--33 to 36 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent, many very fine rounded lime masses; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 5 inches thick)  

    2Cr--36 to 60 inches; interbedded sandstone and shale (gypsiferous mudstone).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Frisite (WY), Grazane (AZ), Griffy (WY), Kiki (NM), Neiber (WY), Papoose  (NV), Redlands (CO), Saddle (WY), and Starmountain (AZ) and Tijeras (NM) soils.  Frisite, Griffy, Papose, Redlands, Starmountain and Tijeras soils are very deep.  Kiki soils have a lithic contact within 40 inches.  Neiber and Saddle soils have yellower hue and soil temperatures of 47 to 49 degrees F. Grazane soils average more than 27 percent clay in the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bacobi soils are on plateaus. Slopes' are 1 to 7 percent.  Elevations range from 4700 to 5900 feet. The soils formed in eolian deposits over slope alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks. The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 11 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is 52 to 55 degrees F. The frost-free period is 165 to 180 days.  

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Jocity, Monue, Sheppard, and Tewa soils.  These soils are very deep.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.  

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation is mainly galleta, alkali sacaton, Indian ricegrass, and shadscale
