BARODA SERIES

The Baroda series consists if very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in 90 to more than 200 centimeters of clayey glacial lacustrine sediments and the underlying loamy glacial till. These soils are very slightly convex, plane, or very slightly concave slopes on glacial lake plains. Slope ranges from0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 735 millimeters. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Very-fine, smectitic, mesic Vertic Argiaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Baroda silty clay loam, on a plane level slope, on a glacial lake plain, in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

(Combined thickness of the Btg horizon is 40 to 100 centimeters.) 

 2BCg1--117 to 137 centimeters; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay loam; weak medium and thick platy structure; friable; few dark clay films on surfaces along pores; few soft lime masses; many fine distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) redoximorphic concentrations; about 5 percent rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.

 2BCg2--137 to 152 centimeters; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few soft lime masses; many fine distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) redoximorphic concentrations; about 5 percent rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.
