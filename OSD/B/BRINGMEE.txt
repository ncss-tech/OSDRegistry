BRINGMEE SERIES



The Bringmee series consists of very deep, well drained soils that

formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Bringmee soils are on stream

terraces and fan terraces and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.

Permeability is moderately slow.  The average annual precipitation is

about 14 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 43

degrees F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Ultic Argixerolls



TYPICAL PEDON:  Bringmee loam on a 6 percent south-southwest facing

slope in irrigated pasture at an elevation of 5,000 feet.  When

described on October 22, 1979, the soil was moist in the upper 6 inches

and dry below this depth.  (Colors are for air dry soils unless

otherwise noted.)



    Ap--0 to 7 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark

brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very

friable; many very fine roots; many very fine to fine tubular pores;

slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)



    BA--7 to 15 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark

brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly

hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and

fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly acid (pH

6.4); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 13 inches thick)



    Bt1--15 to 26 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very

dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky

structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine

roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; few thin clay films on

faces of peds; about 10 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear

smooth boundary.  (10 to 22 inches thick)



    Bt2--26 to 34 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, very dark

grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky

structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine

roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common thin clay films

on faces of peds; about 14 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4);

clear wavy boundary.  (7 to 14 inches thick)



    Bt3--34 to 47 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy clay loam, dark brown

(10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard

firm, sticky and plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few fine

tubular pores; about 14 percent pebbles; few fine distinct mottles;

neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 15 inches thick)



    2C--47 to 61 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly

sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; few fine distinct

mottles; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly

plastic; about 30 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8).



TYPE LOCATION:  Blaine County, Idaho, about 3.5 miles north and 4 miles

east of Carey; 2,500 feet west and 600 feet south of the northeast

corner of section 15, T. 1 S., R. 22 E.



RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:



Average annual soil temperature - 42 to 47 degrees F.

Thickness of mollic epipedon - 20 to 36 inches

Depth to gravelly and cobbly layer - 40 to 60 inches

Reaction - medium acid to neutral

Base saturation - 50 to 75 percent in the upper 75 cm

Minerology - contains significant amounts of volcanic ash in the upper

part of the control section

Mottles are relect-soil profile - no longer shows any evidence of

wetness



A and BA horizons

Value - 3 or 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist

Chroma - 1 or 2 dry or moist



Bt horizons

Value - 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist

Chroma - 2 through 4 dry or moist

Textures - L, SCL, or CL

Coarse fragments - range from 5 to 15 percent

Clay control - 20 to 35 percent

Sand percentage upper 10 inches is 15 to 30 fine sand and coarser in

the fine earth



2C horizons

Value of 5 through 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist

Chroma 3 or 4 dry or moist

Textures - GR-SL, GRV-LCOS, or GRV-LS

Coarse fragments - 25 to 60 percent

Clay content - 0 to 15 percent



COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bauscher, Brinegar, DeMasters,

Pinehurst, and Watchabob.  Bauscher soils lack volcanic ash in the soil

and have more than 30 percent fine sand and coarser.  Brinegar soils

are moderately well drained.  DeMasters and Pinehurst soils have "O"

horizons.  DeMasters soils are skeletal in the lower part of the

argillic horizon.  Pinehurst soils have a 5YR hue and are moderately or

strongly acid in the lower part of the profile.  Watchabob soils are

moderately deep to bedrock.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bringmee soils occur on stream terraces and fan

terraces and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  Elevation range from 4,800

to 6,000 feet. The soil formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.

The annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches, most of which

falls as snow and early spring rain.  The annual air temperature ranges

from 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 60 to 90 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Carey Lake, Drage,

Hutton, Little Wood, and Molyneux.  Carey Lake soils have base

saturation greater than 75 percent in the upper 75 cm and occur on

similar landscapes.  Drage soils have loamy-skeletal control sections

and occur on fan terraces.  Hutton soils are poorly drained and occur

in drainageways.  Little Wood soils have loamy-skeletal control

sections and occur on similar landscape positions.  Molyneux soils have

mollic epipedons 10 to 20 inches thick and occur on fan terraces.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, slow to medium runoff,

moderately slow permeability.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for irrigated cropland and pasture,

minor extent of rangeland.  Vegetation is Basin big sagebrush and Idaho

fescue.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Bringmee soils are inextensive in south

central Idaho.
