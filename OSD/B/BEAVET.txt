BEAVET SERIES

The Beavet series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rock.  These soils are on fan remnants and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 430 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 1 degree C.
