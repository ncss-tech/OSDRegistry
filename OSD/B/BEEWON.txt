BEEWON SERIES

The Beewon series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils on broad uplands.  These nearly level soils formed in skeletal alluvium derived mainly from tuffaceous material associated with the Mitchell Mesa Ignimbrite (welded tuff), Cottonwood Springs Basalt, and the Duff and Pruett Formations.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alsco (AZ), Nolam (NM) and Throne (AZ) series.
Alsco soils have yellower than 7.5YR and the Btk horizon contain less than 10 percent calcium carbonates equivalent.
Nolam soils average 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle size control section.
Throne soils depth to bedrock range is 23 to 39 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Beewon soils are on broad, mid-Pleistocene pediments.  These soils formed in gravelly and cobbly alluvium derived mainly from tuffs of the Duff and Pruett Formations, with some sediments derived from Mitchell Mesa Ignimbrite and the Cottonwood Springs Basalt.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean  annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches, with most occurring July through September.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 64 to 68 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 210 to 260 days, and elevation ranges from 3,500 to 4,500 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Borunda, Chilicotal, Musgrave, Quadria, Rockpens, and Straddlebug soils.  Borunda soils are in the fine-loamy family, have a gypsic horizon, and are moderately deep to tuffaceous bedrock.  Borunda soils are on adjacent lower erosional hillslopes and pediments.  Chilicotal soils are in the loamy-skeletal family, do not have an argillic horizon, and are on higher alluvial fans.  Musgrave soils are very shallow or shallow to weathered tuffaceous bedrock, do not have an argillic horizon, and are on adjacent steep scarps and sideslopes of Pleistocene terraces.  Quadria soils are on younger, slightly lower mid-Pleistocene pediments.  Rockpens soils are in the loamy-skeletal family, do not have an argillic horizon, and are on lower late-Pleistocene stream terraces.  Straddlebug soils are in the fine-loamy family, do not have an argillic horizon, and are on lower Holocene-age alluvial flats and floodplains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is slow.  Runoff is low on slopes of 0 to 1 percent, and medium on slopes of 1 to 3 percent.

USE AND VEGETATION:  This soil is used as rangeland.  Woody species include creosotebush, mesquite, range ratany, and fourwing saltbush.  Grasses in the understory are black grama, bush muhly, sideoats grama, blue grama, slim tridens, Arizona cottontop, cane bluestem, and plains bristlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Trans-Pecos of Texas in the Southern Desertic Basins, Plains, and Mountains (MLRA 42), Desert Grassland vegetative zone.  The series is moderately extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Brewster County, Texas, 1997.  The name is coined.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - 0 to 5 inches.  (A horizon)

Argillic horizon - 5 to 18 inches.  (Bt and Btk horizons)

Calcic horizon - 12 to 69 inches.  (Btk, Bk1, Bk2, Bk3, and 2Btk1 horizons)

Superactive cation exchange activity class - CEC to percent clay ratio 0.60 or greater.  This is assumed from the abundant zeolitic minerals present in the Duff and Pruett Tuffs, and from laboratory data from similar soils in Presidio County, Texas.
