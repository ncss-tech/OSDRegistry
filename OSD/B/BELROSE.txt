BELROSE SERIES

The Belrose series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium of Quarternary age.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on terrace risers of river valleys.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1321 mm (52 in).

In normal years, these soils remain saturated without aquic conditions for 30 or more cumulative days but not more than 2 weeks consecutively during the late winter and early spring months.  The zone of saturation includes the E and upper part of the Bt/E horizons. An apparent water table occurs from 160 to 203 cm (63 to 80 in) during the same period.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used primarily for timber production and wildlife habitat.  Some areas are used as grazed woodland.  Native vegetation is longleaf pine, beach, sycamore, yaupon, andropogons, and panicums.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Hardin County, Texas, 1998.  The name Belrose comes from a small community in Hardin County.

REMARKS:  These soils were previously included with the Bienville and Besner series. Horizonation was changed during the update of MLRA 152B as a result of an examination of the type location and existing pedon descriptions.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle size control section: 25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in).  (Bw and Bw/E horizons)
Ochric epipedon--0 to 51 cm (0 to 20 in) (A, E1 and E2 horizons).
Argillic horizon--51 to 203 cm (20 to 80 in) (Bt/E horizons).
Glossic horizon--51 to 203 cm (20 to 80 in (Bt/E horizons.  The glossic horizon is series criteria but not diagnostic for classification).
Oxyaquic feature--These soils remain saturated from late December to April at a depth of  33 to 112 cm (84 to 44 in) below the surface but do not have aquic conditions in most years.

Additional Comments: The classification was updated in May 1999 from Typic Paleudults to Oxyaquic Paleudults to reflect a change in Soil Taxonomy.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Data from Texas A&M University Soil Characterization Lab on samples (S95TX-199-006) from type location in Hardin County, TX.
