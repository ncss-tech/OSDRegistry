BOVINA SERIES

The Bovina series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous, loamy eolian deposits from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping plains and playa slopes. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 483 mm (19 in) and mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (60 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. Similar soils include the Estacado, Mansker, Pep, Portales, Posey, and Tulia series.
Estacado series: has a calcic horizon between 61 and 100 cm (24 and 40 in).
Mansker and Tulia series: have carbonatic mineralogy; in addition Tulia soils do not have a mollic epipedon.
Posey series: has an ochric epipedon. 
Pep and Portales series: do not have an argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: calcareous, loamy eolian deposits from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. 
Landform: nearly level to gently sloping plains and playa slopes. 
Slope: 0 to 5 percent.
Mean annual air temperature: 14 to 17 degrees C (57 to 62 degrees F).
Mean annual precipitation: 432 to 533 mm (17 to 21 in).
Frost-free period: 185 to 220 days.
Elevation: 975 to 1,433 m (3,200 to 4,700 ft).
Thornthwaite annual P-E Index Values: 25 to 36.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Acuff, Amarillo, Estacado, Mansker, Olton, Pep, Portales, Posey, and Pullman soils. 
Acuff, Amarillo, Olton and Pullman soils are on similar or slightly higher landscape positions and do not have a calcic horizon within 60 cm.
Estacado, Mansker, Pep, Portales, and Posey soils are on similar landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained and moderately permeable. Surface runoff is negligible on less than 1 percent slopes and low on 1 to 5 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used for crop production. Principal crops grown are cotton, grain sorghum, and wheat. Climax vegetation in rangeland is mainly mid and short grasses and includes blue grama, sideoats grama, and buffalograss, with lesser amounts of vine-mesquite, western wheatgrass, galleta or tobosa, silver bluestem, wild alfalfa, and prairie clover with a light to moderate overstory of mesquite. This soil has been correlated to the Limey Upland (R077CY028TX) ecological site in MLRA-77C.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Southern High Plains, Southern Part (MLRA 77C in 
LRR H) of western Texas. The soil is moderately extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED : MLRA-77 Soil Survey; Parmer County, Texas; 2008.

REMARKS: These soils were previously included with the Estacado and Mansker series.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 38 cm (Ap, Bt1 horizons)
Argillic horizon: 15 to 203 cm (Bt, Btkk, Btk horizons)
Calcic horizon: 38 to 203 cm (Btkk, Btk horizons)
Plugged (kk) horizon: 38 to 86 cm (Btkk horizon)
Note: the kk feature is defined as pedogenic carbonate accumulation that is characterized by laterally continuous carbonates that have engulfed rock, sand, silt, and clay particles; plugged the macroporosity of the soil horizon with 50 percent or more calcium carbonate; and obliterated the original soil structure.
