BOREHAM SERIES

The Boreham series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium over loamy-skeletal alluvium derived from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.  Boreham soils are on fan remnants and strath terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haplocalcids

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Duchesne County, Uintah Area Soil Survey, Utah. 1998.  The name is taken from Lake Boreham Reservoir.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 11 to 60 inches.  (Ap horizon)
Calcic horizon:  The zone from 11 to 60 inches.  (Bk and 2Bk horizons)
Lithologic discontinuity:  Loamy-skeletal materials beginning at 42 inches, the top of the 2Bk3. 
Previously, the concept of this soil was a fine-loamy PSCS and was included with the Avalon series. Laboratory data shows a high percentage of clay sized carbonates causing it to have a coarse-loamy PSCS.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Reference sample from pedon 92P107 Duchesne County, Utah 4/93 and partial reference sample from pedon 93P579 Uintah County Utah 12/93.  The cation exchange activity class was determined from laboratory data.
