BROMIDE SERIES

The Bromide series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in residuum weathered from tilted platy siliceous shale and siltstone of Ordovician age.
They are on strongly sloping to steep side slopes of hills or
ridges in the Arbuckle Mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 25 percent.
Mean annual precipitation is 37 inches.  Mean annual temperature
is 63 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, siliceous, active, thermic Ultic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bromide channery silt loam--under a canopy of hardwoods.
                (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A1--0 to 4 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) channery silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft,
friable; common medium and coarse roots; many fine and medium
pores; flat fragments of shale and siltstone make up about 30
percent by volume; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (2 to
6 inches thick)

     A2--4 to 18 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) channery silt
loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, friable; common medium and coarse roots; many fine and medium
pores; flat fragments of shale and siltstone make up about 30
percent by volume; medium acid; clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 16
inches thick)

     B2t--18 to 32 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) extremely
channery silty clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; many medium distinct yellowish red (5YR 5/6) and pale brown (10YR 6/3)
mottles; weak medium blocky structure; hard, firm; few fine and medium roots; patchy clay films on faces of peds; flat fragments
of shale and siltstone make up about 70 percent by volume;
strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (10 to 18 inches thick)

     B3--32 to 36 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/4) extremely channery silt loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, friable; flat fragments of shale and siltstone make up about 80 percent by volume; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 4 inches thick)

     Cr--36 to 40 inches; platy siliceous shale and siltstone
tilted 60 degrees from horizontal.

TYPE LOCATION:  Murray County, Oklahoma; about 1/4 mile East of Dougherty on Oklahoma Highway 110; 1,400 feet west and 750 feet
north of the southeast corner of sec. 1, T. 2 S., R. 2 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to shale and siltstone bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.

The A1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and
chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is channery silt loam or channery loam.  Content of coarse flat fragments make up 15 to 35 percent by
volume.  About 5 to 15 percent by volume is less than 76 mm in diameter and 10 to 20 percent by volume is more than 76 mm in diameter.  Reaction is strongly to slightly acid.

The A2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and
chroma of 3 to 5.  Texture, reaction, and content of coarse
fragments is the same as the A1 horizon.

The B2t horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7, and
chroma of 4 to 6.  It has mottles in shades of red or brown.
Texture is extremely channery silty clay loam or extremely
channery silt loam.  Content of coarse flat fragments make up 60
to 85 percent by volume.  About 20 to 25 percent by volume is less than 76 mm in diameter and 40 to 60 percent by volume is more than
76 mm in diameter.  Base saturation is less than 75 percent, by
sum of cations, throughout the B2t horizon.  Reaction is strongly
to slightly acid.

The B3 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 to 8, and
chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is extremely channery silt loam or extremely channery loam.  Content of coarse flat fragments make up
75 to 90 percent by volume.  About 20 to 25 percent by volume is
less than 76 mm in diameter and 55 to 65 percent by volume is more than 76 mm in diameter.  Reaction is strongly to slightly acid.

The Cr horizon is platy siliceous shale and siltstone that is
tilted more than 20 degrees from horizontal.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other known series in the same family.  Soils in similar families are Darnell, Keese, Kopperl,
Naru, Noble, and Travertine series.  Darnell and Travertine soils have solum less than 20 inches thick.  In addition, Darnell soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments and are formed on flat bedded sandstone of Permian age.  Keese and Noble soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Kopperl
and Naru soils have B2t horizons that have a base saturation of 75 percent or more in some part.  In addition, Naru soils have mixed mineralogy and depth to bedrock is more than 50 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bromide soils are on sloping to steep side slopes of hills or ridges in the Arbuckle Mountains.  The soil
formed in residuum weathered from tilted platy siliceous shale and siltstone of Ordovician age.  The bedrock lie in a northwest - southeast direction.  Slopes are 5 to 25 percent.  The climate is subhumid.  Mean annual precipitation is 36 to 38 inches.  Mean
annual temperature ranges from 62 to 64 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 46 to 62.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing
Travertine soils and the Kiti soils.  Kiti soils have solum less
than 20 inches thick over hard tilted limestone and have a mollic epipedon.  Kiti soils are usually on ridge tops.  Travertine soils occur on ridge tops.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Bromide soils are well drained.
Runoff is rapid and permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for rangeland.  The canopy vegetation consists of post oak, and blackjack oak, and hickory.
The understory consists of a few winged elm and sparse clumps of
tall and midgrasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Arbuckle Mountains of Oklahoma.  The
series is not extensive.
