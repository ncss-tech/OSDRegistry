BARCO SERIES

The Barco series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum from acid sandstone and thin beds of silty and sandy shales of Pennsylvanian age.  These soils are on uplands. Slope ranges from 1 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1020 mm (40 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (60 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, thermic Humic Hapludults

TYPICAL PEDON:  Barco loam, on a north-facing, convex, 3 percent slope in native prairie grasses at an elevation of 308 meters (1010 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

  A--0 to 28 cm (0 to 11 inches); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; strong very fine and fine granular structure; very friable; many fine roots; many worm channels and casts; strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  [15 to 46 cm (6 to 18 inches) thick]

  BA--28 to 46 cm (11 to 18 inches); dark brown (10YR 3/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine roots; common very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) coatings on surfaces of peds and worm casts; many root channels filled with very dark brown (10YR 2/2) material from A horizon; few sandstone fragments; very strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.

  Bt2--58 to 76 cm (23 to 30 inches); brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy clay loam; weak very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; few faint clay films on faces of peds; common very dark grayish brown coatings on faces of peds and worm casts; few fine faint brown (7.5YR 4/4) iron manganese masses and a few coarse prominent red (2.5YR 4/8) masses of oxidized iron; few fine iron covered sandstone fragments; very strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.

  Bt3--76 to 86 cm (30 to 34 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy clay loam; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few faint gray clay films on faces of peds; many medium prominent red (2.5YR 4/8) masses of oxidized iron and common medium faint brown (7.5YR 5/4) iron-manganese masses; few dark concretions (oxides); common fine soft sandstone fragments; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  [Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 25 to 61 cm (10 to 24 inches).]

  Cr--86 to 152 cm (34 to 60 inches); red and light yellowish brown soft weakly stratified sandstone; thin discontinuous lenses of shale and gray and dark gray thick clay films or flows in the vertical cracks of the strata; very strongly acid.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series within the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Barco soils are on uplands. Slope ranges from 1 to 35 percent. The soils formed in residuum derived from acid sandstone that contains thin beds of silty and sandy shales of Pennsylvanian age. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1143 mm (35 to 45 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 15 to 16.6 degrees C (59 to 62 degrees F). Elevation is 195 to 400 meters (640 to 1315 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Barden, Collinsville, Liberal, Parsons and Sylvania soils. Barden, Liberal and Sylvania soils are moderately well drained and are in the Fine family. Collinsville soils are shallow to hard sandstone. Parsons soils are poorly drained and are in the Fine family.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained. Potential for surface runoff is medium to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high (4 to 14 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION:  About equally divided between grassland and cultivated crops.  Principal crops are wheat, soybeans, sorghums, and corn.  Native vegetation is prairie grasses, mainly big bluestem and little bluestem.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  MLRAs 112 and 116 in southwestern Missouri.  The type location is in MLRA 112.  The series is extensive.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Umbric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 46 cm (0 to 18 inches).  (A and BA horizons)
Argillic horizon:  The zone from 46 to 86 cm (18 to 34 inches).  (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)
Paralithic contact:  The contact with sandstone is between 76 and 102 cm (30 and 40 inches).  (Cr horizons)
Lithic contact:  The contact with sandstone is below 102 cm (40 inches).  (R horizons)
Udic soil moisture regime.

These soils are mostly in a wide belt adjacent to the Ozark border area.  The northern boundary is north of the Fort Scott escarpment.

These soils were formerly a part of the Bates series.  They are excluded from that series due to low base saturation.  They were originally classified as Alfisols, but lab data for the type location and from additional pedons from surrounding counties in Missouri shows that the correct classification is as an Ultisol.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by lab sample(s) numbers S90M0-011-006.

7/17/01 - PRF - added activity class and reformatted the RIC. Added chroma 1 to the Bt horizon.
