BULLROAR SERIES

The Bullroar series consists of very deep, well-drained soils on terraces of mountain valley floors.  Bullroar soils formed in volcanic ash over mixed alluvium. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.
