BIGHOLE SERIES

The Bighole series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium on fan remnants, stream terraces and outwash plains.  The oxyaquic feature associated with this soil is a result of prolonged saturation from flood irrigation. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Oxyaquic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Bighole silt loam, in irrigated grass hay (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; undecomposed and partially decomposed matted roots; abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 3 inches thick) 

    A1--2 to 8 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine and very fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many fine and very fine dendritic tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.7); clear wavy boundary.   

    A2--8 to 17 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine and very fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many fine and very fine dendritic tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of A horizons is 10 to 15 inches)

    Bt/E--17 to 26 inches; Bt part (60 percent) light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silt loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; E part (40 percent) very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; few fine faint brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist redox concentrations (due to prolonged saturation from flood irrigation); moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine and few fine dendritic tubular pores; few faint patchy clay films on faces of peds; many silt and sand skeletans on faces of peds; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt--26 to 41 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine and few fine dendritic tubular pores; common faint patchy clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 25 inches thick)

    Bk--41 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) silt loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; very few fine roots; common very fine dendritic tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; disseminated calcium carbonate and many medium and fine patchy soft masses and threads of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).
