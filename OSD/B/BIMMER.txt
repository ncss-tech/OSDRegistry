BIMMER SERIES

The Bimmer series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from granitic rocks. Bimmer soils are on hills. Slopes are 8 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy, mixed, superactive, nonacid, mesic, shallow Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bimmer gravelly sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is covered with about fine 25 percent gravel.

    A1--0 to 5 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 20 percent fine gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 15 cm thick)

    A2--5 to 13 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 20 percent fine gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 13 cm thick)

    Cr--13 to 53 cm; weathered granite.

    R--53 cm; hard granite.

TYPE LOCATION:  Churchill County, Nevada; about 28 miles southeast of Fallon; 2,300 feet south and 300 feet west of the projected northeast corner of section 13, T. 15 N., R. 31 1/2 E.; USGS Fourmile Canyon 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; 39 degrees 09 minutes 50.9 seconds north latitude and 118 degrees 25 minutes 36.2 seconds west longitude, WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.1641389 latitude, -118.426722 longitude. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, dry in summer and fall, moist for short periods in the winter and spring; typic torric moisture regime.
Soil temperature: 10 to 13 degrees C.
Depth to bedrock: 8 to 25 cm to a paralithic contact; unweathered granitic bedrock is commonly within 100 cm.
Reaction: Neutral or slightly alkaline.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 10 to 18 percent. 
Rock fragments: 15 to 35 percent, mainly fine gravel. Lithology of fragments is granitic rock such as granite or granodiorite.


A horizons
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3.
Texture: Sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Weena series. Weena soils have 18 to 27 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bimmer soils are on hills. They formed in residuum derived from granitic rocks. Slopes are 8 to 30 percent. Elevations range from 1,340 to 1,770 meters. The climate is cool-arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Budihol soil. Budihol soils are loamy, very shallow and shallow to weathered granitic rocks, and have an aridic moisture regime bordering xeric.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; low or medium surface runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Bimmer soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly Bailey greasewood, shadscale, bud sagebrush, Nevada ephedra, spiny hopsage, winterfat, spiny menodora, Indian ricegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 27.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Churchill County Area, Nevada, 1995.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: The zone from the soil surface to 13 cm (A1 and A2 horizons).
Paralithic contact: The boundary at 13 cm to underlying soft, weathered bedrock (Cr layer).
