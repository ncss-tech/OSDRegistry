BYCRACKY SERIES

The Bycracky series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils on basin floors and benches of glaciated mountain slopes. Bycracky soils formed in peat mixed with or overlying volcanic ash overlying lacustrine sediments or glaciofluvial material derived from mixed materials dominated by granitic rocks. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 48 inches and mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, isotic, euic Terric Cryofibrists

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bycracky peat, marshland, on a 5 percent south - facing slope at an elevation of 7280 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

  Oi1--0 to 12 inches; black (10YR 2/1) peat, brown (7.5YR 4/2) dry; 85 percent fibers, rubbed; many very fine and fine roots; very strongly acid (pH 4.5); clear smooth boundary.

  Oi2--12 to 20 inches; black (10YR 2/1) peat, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) dry; 85 percent fibers, rubbed; common fine and very fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; strongly acid (pH 5.5); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of Oi horizons is 14 to 48 inches)

  2Bw--20 to 28 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) ashy silt loam (volcanic ash), light gray (10YR7/2) dry; massive, soft, friable, nonsticky, and nonplastic; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick)

  3Oe--28 to 41 inches; black (10YR 2/1) mucky peat, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) dry; 45 percent fibers, rubbed; few very fine irregular pores; moderately acid (pH 5.7); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 19 inches thick)

  4C--41 to 61inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; massive; slightly hard, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; 5 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0).

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon (93-362) are:
fibric organic soil material: 0 to 20 inches;  Oi1, Oi2
Terric subgroup: based on the 4C horizon having its upper boundary within the control section below the surface tier and being 12 inches or more in thickness.  The 2Bw horizon lacks the thickness.  Consequently the depth to the 4C horizon cannot occur below 52 inches.
particle-size control section: 20 to 28 and 41 to 45 inches; 2Bw, 4C
aquandic feature: 20 to 28 inches; 2Bw
