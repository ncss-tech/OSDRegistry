BRULE SERIES

The Brule series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils.  These soils formed in silty alluvium of Holocene age.  Brule soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping, natural levees in flood plains of major streams on the Gulf Coast Prairie.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.   Mean annual air temperature is about 19.5 degrees C (67 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1549 mm (61in).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Acadiana (LA), Barbary (LA), Basile (LA), Crowley (LA), Duson (LA), Iota (LA), Kaplan (LA), Kinder (LA), and Vidrine (LA)soils.
Barbary soils:  Hydraquents; ponded backswamps; n-value of more than 0.7 above 40 in.
Acadiana, Crowley, Duson, Iota, and Kaplan soils: are Alfisols;  on side slopes above drainageways on higher landforms. 
Basile soils:  Alfisols; on lower elevations in floodplains. 
Kinder and Vidrine soils: Alfisols;  broad, nearly level, higher, stream divide landscape positions; Vidrine soils are on circular mounds in a complex with the Kinder soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  :  Moderately well drained.  Permeability is moderate.  Runoff is negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes and low on 1 to 3 percent slopes.  Flooding is frequent for very brief to brief periods, unless protected.  In some years these soils flood for long duration. A water table exists from 76 to 122 (30 to 48 in) of the surface from December to April in normal years.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are in woodland with bottomland hardwood species, mainly sweetgum, water oak, sweetbay, overcup oak, and cherrybark oak trees dominant.  A few small areas have been cleared and used for improved pasture.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  LLR T, Southwest Louisiana on the Coast Prairie (MLRA 150A).  Brule soils are of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Temple, Texas.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Acadia Parish, Louisiana; 2000.

REMARKS:  Brule soils (pronounced "brew-lay") were formerly included with the Cascilla series.  These Ultisols in broad drainageways, associated with Alfisols on adjacent uplands, are presumed to have formed from sediments transported from Tertiary age or other low base status materials (see pg. 63 Holocene age parent materials discussion in 'Landforms and Surface Geology' section by Dr. Bobby Miller; Allen Parish, Louisiana Soil Survey report, Sept. 1980).
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon-0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in) (A and AB horizon)
Cambic horizon-25 to 94 cm (10 to 37 in) (Bw horizons)
Argillic horizon-94 to 203 cm (37 to 80 in) (2Bt/E, 2Eg/Bt, 2Btg/E, and 2Btg horizons)
Glossic horizon-94 to 150 cm (37 to 59 in) (2Bt/E, 2Eg/Bt, 2Btg/E horizons)
