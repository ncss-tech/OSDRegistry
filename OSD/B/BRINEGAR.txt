BRINEGAR SERIES



The Brinegar series consists of very deep, moderately well drained

soils on alluvial fans and terraces.  They formed in mixed alluvium

from acid and basic igneous, and some sedimentary rocks.  Permeability

is moderately slow.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  The average

annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the average annual air

temperature is about 41 degrees F.

moderate medium angular blocky; very hard, very firm, sticky and

plastic; many fine roots between peds; many fine and few medium tubular

pores; continuous moderately thick clay films on faces of peds and in

pores; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary.  (7 to 12 inches

thick)

fine roots; many fine tubular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy

boundary.  (6 to 10 inches thick)



    C2--40 to 49 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) gravelly coarse sand,

brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; single grained; loose; few very fine and fine

roots; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 10 inches

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bauscher, Bringmee (T), DeMasters,

Pinehurst, and Watchabob series.  Bauscher, Bringmee, and DeMasters

soils are not saturated with water in early spring and lack mottles

above depth of 40 inches.  Pinehurst soils have O horizons and 5YR hue,

dry.  Watchabob soils are well drained and moderately deep over

bedrock.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Brinegar soils are on alluvial fans and terraces

and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 4,800 to 6,000

feet.  The soils formed in mixed alluvium weathered from granite,

andesite, basalt, and some sedimentary rocks.  The climate is subhumid

continental, having cool dry summers and cold moist winters.  Average

annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  Mean January temperature is

15 degrees F, mean July temperature is 66 degrees F, and the average

annual temperature is 39 degrees to 43 degrees F.  Frost-free period is

about 60 to 100 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brailsford, Houk,

Marshdale, Riceton, Simonton, and Strom soils.  Brailsford soils have a

light colored surface soil and are somewhat poorly drained.  Houk soils

are fine-montmorillonitic and are somewhat poorly drained.  Marshdale

soils are poorly drained and lack a B2t horizon.  Riceton soils are

well drained, lack a B2t horizon and have a coarse-loamy control

section.  Simonton soils are well drained.  Strom soils are somewhat

poorly drained.  Brailsford, Houk, Marshdale, and Strom soils are on

bottomland positions.  Riceton and Simonton soils are on alluvial fans

and terraces.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; very slow through

medium runoff; moderately slow permeability; occasional overflow during

snowmelt.



USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for irrigated and

nonirrigated small grains, hay, pasture, and range.  Potential

vegetation in the natural plant community is mainly silver sage and

meadow plants.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern and south-central Idaho.  The

series is moderately extensive.
