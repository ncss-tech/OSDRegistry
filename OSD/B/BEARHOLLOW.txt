BEARHOLLOW SERIES

The Bearhollow series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed alluvium with some loess influence.  They are on hills, fan terraces and undulating basalt plains.  Permeability is moderate.  Bearhollow soils have slopes of 1 to 60 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and average annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Calcixerepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Bearhollow gravelly loam, nonirrigated cropland; on an 18 percent slope at 6,520 feet elevation.  When described on June 13, 1989 the soil was moist to 6 inches and dry below. (Color is for air dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series listed in this family.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bearhollow soils are on hills, fan terraces and undulating basalt plains.  Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent.  Elevations range from 5,200 to 6,600 feet.  The soil formed in mixed alluvium with some loess influence.  Average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, average annual temperature is 38 to 44 degrees F., the frost free period is 65 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brifox (T), Iphil and Rexburg soils.  Brifox soils have a fine particle-size control section. Iphil and Rexbrug soils have mollic epipedons and a coarse-silty particle-size control section.  Brifox soils are on terraces and hills, lower and higher on the landscape than Bearhollow soils.  Iphil soils are on similar positions as Bearhollow soils, but are on smooth to convex north and west-facing slopes.  Rexburg soils are on loess covered hills and terraces lower on the landscape than Bearhollow soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to very rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Bearhollow soils are used for nonirrigated cropland.  Typical crops consist of small grains and alfalfa.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho.  The soils of this series are of small extent.
