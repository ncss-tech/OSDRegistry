BEETVILLE SERIES

The Beetville series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in stratified, moderately coarse textured alluvium dominantly from quartzite and rhyolite. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent on pediments and in valleys. The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Torrifluventic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Beetville loam, cultivated -- on a nearly level stream terrace at 4,340 feet elevation. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

 A--0 to 13 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common very fine and fine pores; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); abrupt wavy boundary. (7 to 19 inches thick)

 C--13 to 33 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; few fine faint reddish brown iron concentrations below a depth of 25 inches; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; few very fine and fine pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (10 to 25 inches thick)

 Ck1--33 to 49 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; many very fine and fine pores; slightly calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary. 

 2Ck2--49 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) loamy sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; loose, very friable; common fine interstitial pores; slightly calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

TYPE LOCATION: Cassia County, Idaho; about 10 miles southwest of Burley; 500 feet east and 165 feet south of the NW corner of the NE1/4, section 16, T.12 S., R.22 E.; USGS Burley Butte Quadrangle; Latitude - 42 degrees, 23 minutes, 15 seconds N. and Longitude - 113 degrees, 52 minutes, 49 seconds W., NAD 83.

Particle-size control section - 0 to 25 percent coarse fragments and 9 to 18 percent clay
Reaction (pH) - neutral through moderately alkaline
Moisture control section - dry 60 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice
Average annual soil temperature - 49 to 54 degrees F.

A horizon

C and Ck horizons
Hue - 10YR or 2.5Y
Value - 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist
Chroma - 2 or 3 dry or moist
Texture - (stratified) L, SIL, FSL, SL, LFS or LS
Effervescence - noneffervescent to strongly effervescent

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cleman, Dressler, Kimberly, Kodak, Ravendog and Sheepskin (T) series. Cleman, Kimberly, Ravendog and Sheepskin soils are well drained. Kodak soils have C and Ab horizons below 50cm with 10 to 20 percent organic matter and average annual soil temperature of 12 to 14 degrees C. Dressler soils have 3 to 9 percent clay content in the particle-size control section and a cambic horizon. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Beetville soils are nearly level on stream terraces and flood-plain steps at elevations of 2,475 to 4,800 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in stratified, moderately coarse textured alluvium from mixed rock sources, dominantly quartzite and rhyolite. Average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. Average annual temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F. Frost-free period is 100 to 155 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Drax and Goose Creek soils. These soils have fine-loamy particle-size control sections and are on similar geomorphic positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained with normal seasonal high saturation between 40 and 72 inches; rare flooding where not protected; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Beetville soils are used mainly for irrigated cropland and hayland/pasture. Beans, corn, potatoes, sugar beets, and small grains are the principal crops. Native vegetation is basin big sagebrush and basin wildrye. Some areas are used for homesites.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South central and southwestern Idaho. MLRA 11 and 25. Beetville soils are not extensive.

REMARKS: This revision updates the taxonomic subgroup from Fluventic to Torrifluventic. An erroneous location (township) is also corrected.
Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon: 
Mollic epipedon - zone from 0 to 13 inches (A horizon) 
Irregular decrease in organic-carbon - zone from 13 to 49 inches (stratified C horizon) 
Stripped matrix - zone from 49 to 60 inches (2Ck horizon)
Soil moisture regime - aridic bordering on xeric
The faint Fe concentrations that occur in the upper profile are assumed to be result of flood irrigation.
Carbonates in the Ck1 and 2Ck2 horizons are assumed to be primary (not secondary).
