DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: moderately well drained. Runoff is medium. These soils have episaturation in the upper part of the glossic horizon during the winter to early spring in normal years and endosaturation in the Bt/Eg horizons during same period.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used primarily for timber production and wildlife habitat.  Some areas are used for pasture and crops.  Loblolly pine is the most common woodland species.  Areas in pasture are planted to bahiagrass and improved species of bermuda grass.  Crops grown include soybeans and vegetables.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeast Texas mainly east of the Trinity River; Land Resource Region T; MLRA 152B (some areas extend into MLRA 150A along major drainageways that are wooded); the series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Hardin County, Texas 1998.

REMARKS: These soils were formerly included with the Katy, Anahuac, or Kirbyville series. The series was updated during the update of MLRA 152B. Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:

Ochric epipedon- 0 to 74 cm (0 to 29 in) (A, E1, and E2 horizons)

Argillic horizon- 89 to 203 cm (29 to 80 in) (E/Bt, Bt/E and Bt/Eg horizons)

Glossic horizon- 74 to 203 cm (29 to 80 in) (E/Bt, Bt/E and Bt/Eg horizons)

Oxyaquic feature- These soils are saturated within 100 cm (40 in) of the surface during the winter and early spring months in normal years.
