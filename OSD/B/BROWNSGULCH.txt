BROWNSGULCH SERIES

The Brownsgulch series are very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from rhyolite and other moderately fine-grained igneous rocks.  These soils are on alluvial fans, mountain slopes and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 406 millimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Pachic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Brownsgulch sandy loam, in rangeland on a 28 percent slope at 1,798 meters elevation (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise indicated).

    A1--0 to 15 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; very friable, soft, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 8 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 25 cm thick)

    A2--15 to 30 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; very friable, soft, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 15 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 30 cm thick)

    A3--30 to 51 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; very friable, soft, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 25 cm thick)

    Bw--51 to 84 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm, slightly hard, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and common fine roots; common fine irregular pores; 25 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (15 to 110 cm thick) 

    C--84 to 152 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; firm, hard, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; common fine irregular pores; 30 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8).
