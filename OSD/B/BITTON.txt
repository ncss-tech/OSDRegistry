BITTON SERIES 

The Bitton series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from mixed rock sources of sandstone and shale.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, treads, terrace risers and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Entic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bitton gravelly loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A1--0 to 4 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; 15 percent pebbles; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary. 

    A2--4 to 11 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; 20 percent pebbles; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizons is 7 to 15 inches) 

    Bw--11 to 21 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; 25 percent pebbles; strongly effervescent with disseminated lime; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 15 inches thick) 

    Bk--21 to 46 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; 65 percent pebbles; lime casts on undersides of pebbles and disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 30 inches thick) 

    BCk--46 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly loam stratified with gravelly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; 45 percent pebbles; lime casts on undersides of pebbles, disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).
