BROSE SERIES

The Brose series consists of soils that are well drained and shallow soils that formed from colluvium and residuum from welded tuff.  They are on summits.  Permeability is very slow.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 360 mm, and the average annual temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, smectitic, frigid Lithic Ultic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Brose extremely cobbly loam--on a northwest-facing slope of 3 percent under native rangeland at 1,985 meters elevation. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.) When described on October 3, 1977 the soil profile was dry throughout.

    A1--0 to 3 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely cobbly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 30 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 10 cm thick)

    A2--3 to 8 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/1) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 15 cm thick)

    Bt1--8 to 23 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (13 to 20 cm thick)

    Bt2--23 to 28 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly clay, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8) abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 15 cm thick)

    2Bt3--28 to 46 cm; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) gravelly clay, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; many prominent clay films faces of peds and in pores; 30 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (10 to 18 cm thick)

    2R--46 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) welded tuff bedrock black (10YR 2/1) moist; extremely hard; silica coating in places on rock faces.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Aldi and Alding series.  Aldi and Alding soils have an average annual soil temperature of 6.1 to 8.3 degrees C., and have precipitation greater than 410 mm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Brose soils are on summits.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  The soils formed from colluvium and residuum from welded tuff.  Elevations are 1,710 feet to 2,015 meters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 300 to 410 mm.  The average annual temperature is 4.4 to 6.7 degreesC.  The frost free season is 70 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Amboat, Congle, Doodlelink, Eep, Forvic, Hogmalat, Keman, and Mug soils.  Amboat soils occur on the same landscape and are very deep and skeletal.  Congle, Doodlelink, and Eep soils occur on backslopes, footslopes and breaks.  Congle and Doodlelink soils are very deep and Pachic.  Eep soils are ash-skeletal.  Forvic and Mug soils occur on terraces and are moderately deep.  Hogmalat soils occur on shoulders, backslopes and summits, are cryic, and are loamy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained, medium runoff; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Brose soils are used for rangeland.  Native vegetation is Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, and low sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Brose soils are of moderate extent in south central Idaho. MLRA 25.
