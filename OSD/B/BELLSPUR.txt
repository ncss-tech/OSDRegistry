MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Patrick County, Virginia, 2008.

REMARKS: Bellspur soils were previously mapped as Cowee soils. Soil creep is evident in pedons on steep and very steep slopes. Few faint clay films in the B horizon indicate translocation of clay has occurred; however, laboratory data does not support an argillic horizon. Bellspur soils have a dark surface that is too thin for an Umbric epipedon. It is anticipated once the current Humudepts/Dystrudepts taxonomy proposal is approved, Bellspur soils will be reclassified as Humic Dystrudepts.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 8 inches (A horizon)
Cambic horizon--the zone from 8 to 28 inches (Bt and BC horizons)
Paralithic contact--35 inches (upper boundary of the Cr layer)
Paralithic materials--35 to 41 inches (Cr layer)
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 41 inches
