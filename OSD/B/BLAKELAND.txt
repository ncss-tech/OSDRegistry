BLAKELAND SERIES

The Blakeland series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian and alluvial materials from arkose deposits. They are on uplands, often adjacent to drainageways, and have slopes of 2 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 41 centimeters (16 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Torriorthentic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Blakeland loamy coarse sand, grassland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

  A--0 to 30 centimeters (0 to 12 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loamy coarse sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure parting to single grained; soft, loose; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (25 to 51 centimeters (10 to 20 inches) thick)

  AC--30 to 41 centimeters (12 to 16 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy coarse sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak very coarse angular blocky structure parting to weak coarse granular; slightly hard, loose; neutral; gradual smooth boundary. (10 to 15 centimeters (4 to 6 inches) thick)

  C--41 to 152 centimeters (16 to 60 inches); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loamy coarse sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; hard, loose; neutral.

TYPE LOCATION:  Arapahoe County, Colorado; 0.2 mile west and 0.1 mile south of the NE corner of sec. 28, T. 5 S., R. 62 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Noncalcareous: more than 152 centimeters (60 inches) but depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches
Base saturation: 60 to 100 percent
Mollic epipedon: 25 to 51 centimeters (10 to 20 inches) thick 
Particle size control section: loamy coarse sand or coarse sand (large proportion of angular granitic sand) 
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent, most of which are fine pebbles 
Sand fraction: medium and coarser angular sand with a large proportion of flat bearing surfaces between sand grains, ranges from 15 to about 90 percent. 
Horizons of Low organic matter have a differential between dry and moist consistence that is 1 to 3 times greater than soils of similar texture having finer or more rounded sand grains.

A horizon:
Hue: 2.5Y to 7.5YR
Value: 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 1 to 3
Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline.

C horizon:
Hue: 5Y to 7.5YR
Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Dailey and Orsa series. 
Dailey soils have small amounts of medium, coarse, and very coarse angular sand, and are not unusually hard when dry. 
Orsa soils have 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments in a major part of the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: eolian sediments blown out of adjacent stream channels that drain arkose areas and alluvial fans in areas of arkose deposits.
Landforms: uplands often marginal to drainageways. 
Slopes: 2 to 40 percent. 
Average annual precipitation: 406 millimeters (16 inches) peak periods of precipitation occurring during the spring and summer
Mean annual temperature: 10 degrees C. (50 degrees F.)
Mean summer temperature: 22.2 degrees C. (72 degrees F.)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bresser and Truckton soils and the competing Orsa soils. 
Bresser and Truckton soils have an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage: somewhat excessively drained
Runoff: low
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: very high

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally as native rangeland. 
They are cultivated to dryland crops in some areas and are irrigated with sprinklers in other areas. 
Native vegetation is a tall and short grass association. 
Adjacent to the colder portions of the series range, there are patches of oakbrush and mountain-mahogany.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central Colorado in MLRA 67.  The soil is of moderate extent.
