BLAINE SERIES

The Blaine series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from igneous rock, conglomerate, hard shale or sandstone. These soils are on escarpments, hills, ridges, cuestas and mountain slopes. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Blaine gravelly loam, rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 4 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; 35 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt--4 to 10 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine blocky; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and on coarse fragments; 35 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 14 inches thick)

    Bk1--10 to 16 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) very gravelly loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine blocky; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; 30 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; many films and soft masses of calcium carbonate and calcium carbonate casts on undersides of fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

    Bk2--16 to 24 inches; light olive gray (5Y 6/2) very gravelly loam, olive (5Y 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; 35 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; few soft masses of calcium carbonate and many thin calcium carbonate casts on undersides of fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary.

    R--24 inches; fractured igneous bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - escarpments, hills, ridges, cuestas and mountain slopes
Elevation - 4,000 to 7,500 feet
Slope - 0 to 60 percent
Parent material - colluvium and residuum derived from igneous rock, conglomerate, hard shale or sandstone 
Climate - long cold winters, cool, moist springs; short summers
Mean annual precipitation - 15 to 23 inches
Mean annual temperature is 36 to 45 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 30 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cheadle and Rootel soils. Cheadle soils are shallow to a lithic contact. Rootel soils have a calcic horizon and do not have a mollic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Blaine soils are used mainly for rangeland.  Potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, needleandthread, blue grama, forbs, and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Blaine soils are of moderate extent in central and southwestern Montana. MLRAs - 43B, 44B.
