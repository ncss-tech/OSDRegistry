REMARKS:  
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon: 
particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 33 to 74 centimeters (Bt and Btk 
horizons); 
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (A, Bt, 
Btk, Bk, and C horizons); 
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 33 centimeters (A horizon); 
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 33 to 74 centimeters (Bt and Btk horizons). 
Cation-exchange class is inferred from lab data for similar soils in the surrounding area.
