BEND SERIES

The Bend series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in glaciolacustrine sediments on lake plains.  Permeability is slow. Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bend loam--on a west-facing slope of 3 percent in a cultivated field.  When described the soil was dry throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

Ap--0 to 8 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, very friable; slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots throughout; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.  (7 to 10 inches thick)

Bw--8 to 13 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots throughout; neutral; clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 16 inches thick)

Bk--13 to 38 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky; very hard, friable; slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots throughout; common fine accumulations of carbonate; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 33 inches thick)

C--38 to 46 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) silt loam, varved with very thin layers of very fine sand to clay; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; many medium and coarse distinct relic mottles of light gray (10YR 7/1); common medium prominent brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) iron stains; massive; hard, friable; slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 1 to 2 mm thick varves;common fine cylindrical iron concretions; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.

Cyz--46 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) silt loam varved with very thin layers of very fine sand to clay, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist, many medium and coarse distinct relic mottles of light gray (10YR 7/1); common medium prominent brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) iron stains; massive; hard, friable; slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 1 to 2 mm thick varves; common fine and medium plate like nests of gypsum; few fine cylindrical salt masses; common fine cylindrical iron concretions; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Hyde County, South Dakota; about 12 miles north of Highmore; 1240 feet south and 1450 feet east of the northwest corner of section 17, T. 114 N., R. 71 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches.  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 11 to 26 inches.  Depth to varved material is 30 to 40 inches.

The Ap horizon has value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam or loam with 20 to 27 percent clay.  It is slightly acid to mildly alkaline.

The Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam with less than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.

The Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam or loam with less than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.

The C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam or loam with very thin varves of very fine sand to clay.  It is mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline.

The Cyz horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam with very thin varves of very fine sandy to clay.  It is mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Homme, Nuckolls, and Uly series. Homme, Nuckolls, and Uly soils do not have varves above a depth of 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bend soils are on glacial lake plains.  Slopes are convex and range from 0 to 9 percent.  They formed on backslopes in calcareous glaciolacustrine sediments.  Mean annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 17 to 19 inches.  Growing season is about 130 to 150 days; average growing season precipitation is about 13 to 15 inches; and growing degree days are about 2800 to 3200.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Edwin Java, and Tetonka soils.  Edwin and Java soils have free carbonates above a depth of 11 inches and are on shoulders.  The poorly drained Tetonka soils are in basins.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Surface runoff is slow or medium.  Permeability is slow.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used to grow small grains and alfalfa. Some areas are in native range of blue grama, western wheatgrass, green needlegrass, sideoats grama, needleandthread, sedges and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East central South Dakota.  The series is of small extent.
