BOOFORD SERIES

The Booford series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in andesitic volcanic ash and colluvium and residuum derived from tuff and tuffaceous sedimentary rock.  Booford soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, smectitic, frigid Typic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Booford stony loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 8 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) stony loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular and interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 13 cm thick)

    A2--8 to 20 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many medium, common very fine and fine, few coarse roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 15 cm thick)

    Bt1--20 to 30 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 20 cm thick)

    Bt2--30 to 51 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; strong coarse prismatic structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine, fine and coarse roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films faces of peds and lining pores; slightly acid (pH 6.4); smooth boundary.  (20 to 50 cm thick)

    Bt3--51 to 64 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; massive; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine and medium roots; very few very fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on rock fragments; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 15 cm thick)

    Crt--64 cm; weathered and fractured andesitic tuff; some distinct clay films and roots lining the fractures.

TYPE LOCATION:  Washoe County, Nevada; on the Toiyabe National Forest about 2.5 miles southeast of Verdi; approximately 1,300 feet west and 1,800 feet south of the northeast corner of section 28, T. 19 N., R. 18 E.; USGS Mount Rose NW 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 29 minutes 09 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 75 minutes 34 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.4858333 latitude, -119.9594444 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually moist in winter and spring; dry in late summer and fall; typic xeric soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 6 to 8 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 18 to 48 cm; includes the Bt1 horizon.
Depth to base of argillic horizon: 50 to 100 cm.
Depth to bedrock: 50 to 100 cm to a paralithic contact.  The paralithic materials below the contact are weathered volcanic rocks such as tuff and andesite.
Reaction: Slightly acid or neutral.

A horizons
Value:  3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma:  1 or 2, dry or moist.
Organic matter content:  2 to 4 percent.

Bt1 horizon
Hue:  10YR or 7.5YR.
Value:  4 or 5 dry.
Chroma:  2 or 3, dry or moist.
Texture:  Silty clay loam, clay loam, clay, or gravelly clay.
Clay content:  35 to 45 percent.
Rock fragments:  5 to 25 percent.
Structure:  Subangular blocky, angular blocky, or prismatic.
Organic matter content: 1 to 3 percent.

Bt2 and Bt3 horizons
Hue:  10YR or 7.5YR.
Value:  4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4, dry or moist.
Texture:  Clay, silty clay, or gravelly clay.
Clay content: 45 to 60 percent.
Rock fragments: 0 to 25 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Beefhollow, Harter, Leftfork, Manila, Marsden, Observation, Ostler, Rob Roy, Shagnasty, and Tatouche series.

Beefhollow, Leftfork, Harter, Manila, Marsden, Ostler, Shagnasty, and Tatouche soils are deeper than 100 cm to bedrock.  Observation and Rob Roy soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Booford soils are on hills and mountains.  These soils formed in andesitic volcanic ash and colluvium and residuum derived from tuff and tuffaceous sedimentary rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,525 to 1,985 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 330 to 460 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 85 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Fraval and Jumbo soils.  These soils have less than 75 percent base saturation in the A horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high surface runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Booford soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is mountain big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, mountain brome, and Idaho fescue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western and northern Nevada and southwestern Idaho.  These soils are not extensive with about 9,300 acres of the series mapped to date.  The original series concept is in MLRA 22A, while other acreage occurs in MLRAs 25 and 26.
