BEAVERTON SERIES 

The Beaverton series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly alluvium or glacial outwash materials.  These soils have extremely gravelly sand at a depth of 10 to 20 inches.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, hills, and outwash plains.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT0002, MT0473, MT0673, MT1121.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon - the zone from the soil surface of the soil to a depth of 14 inches (A, Bt1, Bt2 horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from 2 to 14 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizons); particle-size control section - the zone from 2 to 14 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizons); horizon of sandy-skeletal materials - the zone from 14 to 60 inches (2Bk1, 2Bk2 horizons). secondary carbonate accumulation - the zone from 14 to 60 inches (2Bk1, 2Bk2 horizons).  Beaverton soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime. 

The family classification was changed from Loamy-skeletal to Loamy-skeletal over sandy or sandy-skeletal in 1993.
