BALDY SERIES

The Baldy series consists of deep, well drained, moderately rapid to rapid permeable soils formed in materials from rhyolite and andesite with some influence from basalt and ash on mountain slopes. Slopes range from 8 to 65 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 35 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, nonacid Typic Cryorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Baldy cobbly fine sandy loam, forest. (Colors for dry conditions unless otherwise noted.)

    O1--1 inch to 0; fir, aspen and spruce litter.

(6 to 12 inches thick)

    C3--18 to 32 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist, with few fine faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) mottles; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; plentiful fine and coarse roots; common fine tubular pores; 25 to 30 percent coarse fragments; noneffervescent; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary. (12 to 18 inches thick)

    C4--32 to 42 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) cobbly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist, with few fine faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) mottles; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; plentiful coarse roots; common fine interstitial and tubular pores; 30 to 40 percent coarse fragments noneffervescent; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 30 inches thick)

TYPE LOCATION:  On mountain slopes east of Hurricane Lake, SE part of sec. 12, T.5N., R.26E., Apache County, Arizona.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Baldy soils occur on 8 percent undulating to 65 percent steep mountain slopes. The regolith consists of medium and moderately coarse-textured materials from rhyolite and andesite with some influence from basalt and ash. These soils occur at elevations of 9,000 to 11,500 feet in a sub-alpine climate. The average annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 40 inches. The mean annual temperature ranges from 38 degrees F. to 45 degrees F. and the frost-free season ranges from 70 to 85 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Gordo, Sponseller, Sizer, Bandera and Ess series. The Gordo and Sponseller soils both have argillic horizons and are moderately fine-textured.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well-drained with medium runoff.  Permeability is moderately rapid to rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for the production of timber and wildlife with some grazing to livestock. Vegetation consists of Douglas fir, Engleman spruce, ponderosa pine, white pine and aspen, with an understory of mountain muhly, mountain brome, mountain June grass and Sitanian.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East central Arizona and possibly New Mexico.  The series is moderately extensive. MLRA 39.
