BALKAN SERIES

The Balkan series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in dense, loamy till on moraines and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C. and mean annual precipitation is about 660 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Mollic Glossaqualfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Balkan loam in a shallow drainageway on a moraine under mixed deciduous and coniferous forest. Elevation of about 450 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Btg2--104 to 173 centimeters; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay loam; moderate medium platy structure parting to moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky; firm; common grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay films on faces of peds; common medium distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) and common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) Fe concentrations; 2 percent gravel; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of Btg horizons is 41 to 112 centimeters)

    BCd--173 to 203 centimeters; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam; strong very coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium platy; very firm; few grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay films on vertical faces of peds; common medium distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) Fe depletions and common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) Fe concentrations; 5 percent gravel; 1 percent cobbles; slightly acid.

TYPE LOCATION: Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) 57-Northern Minnesota Gray Drift, St. Louis County, Minnesota (Virginia subset); about 4 miles north of Chisholm; 800 feet west and 1150 feet north of the southeast corner of section 36, T. 59N., R. 21W; USGS Dewey Lake Quadrangle; latitude 47 degrees 32 minutes 48 seconds N. and longitude 92 degrees 56 minutes 15 seconds W.

Some pedons may have a thin layer of local colluvial/alluvial material on the surface.

A horizon:
Hue--10YR, or is neutral
Value--1 to 3
Chroma--0 to 2

Some pedons have a BC horizon.

BCd horizon:

This horizon commonly has fractures.

COMPETING SERIES: No other series is in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--loamy till
Landform--concave and linear slopes in depressions and drainageways, or on flats, on moraines and till plains

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Near the type location, these are the Greatscott, Nashwauk and Keewatin soils. They form a hydroseqence with the Balkan soils
Greatscott--are on higher and more sloping landscape positions and are in the Haplic Glossudalfs subgroup
Nashwauk--are on higher landscape positions and are in the Oxyaquic Glossudalfs subgroup
Keewatin--are on slightly higher landscape positions and are in the Aquic Glossudalfs subgroup

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--Poorly drained and very poorly drained--these soils have seasonal high saturation at the surface during spring and fall in normal years
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--1.00 to 10.00 micrometers per second in the surface layer, 0.10 to 10.00 micrometers per second in the subsurface layer and in the subsoil, and 0.01 to 1.00 micrometers per second in the underlying dense till
Ponding--the very poorly drained phase ponds water following periods of heavy rainfall

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are forested. Principal trees are aspen, white spruce, black ash and balsam fir. A few areas are used for pastureland and hayland. Native vegetation is mixed deciduous and coniferous forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Physiographic Division--Interior Plains
Physiographic Province--Central Lowlands
Physiographic section--Western Lake section
