BIGBEAR SERIES

The Bigbear series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium or colluvium.  These soils are on hills, escarpments and relict stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Bigbear loam, in hayland (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 9 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to strong fine granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; 5 percent pebbles, 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 12 inches thick)

    Bt1--9 to 13 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to strong fine granular;  slightly hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine and few fine and medium roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 5 percent pebbles, 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.

    Bt2--13 to 35 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium subangular blocky; very hard, very firm, sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; many prominent clay films on  faces of peds and lining pores; 10 percent pebbles, 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of Bt horizons is 14 to 28 inches).

    Bk--35 to 60 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) very cobbly sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; 15 percent pebbles, 20 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; common large masses of lime; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).

USE AND VEGETATION: Bigbear soils are used mainly for hayland, pasture and rangeland.  Potential native vegetation may include subalpine needlegrasses, big bluegrass, Idaho fescue, rough and spike Fescues, mountain brome, sedges, lupine, sticky geranium and other grasses and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Bigbear soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Gallatin County, Montana, 1997.

REMARKS:  Soi interpretation record: MT1444, MT1604. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: a mollic epipedon from the surface to 13 inches (A, Bt1 horizons), an argillic horizon from 9 to 35 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizon); a calcic horizon from 35 to 60 inches (Bk horizon); a particle-size control section from 9 to 29 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizons). Bigbear soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
