BRILEY SERIES

The Briley series consists of very deep, sandy, well drained soils, that formed in sandy and loamy Coastal Plain marine deposits on the Sparta, Queen City, and Carrizo Sands. These gently sloping to moderately steep soils are on broad interfluves. Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent but are dominantly 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1118 mm (44 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C (66 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Arenic Paleudults 

TYPICAL PEDON: Briley loamy fine sandy, smooth convex, 3 percent slope in woodland. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)
