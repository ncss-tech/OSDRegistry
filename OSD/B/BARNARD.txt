BARNARD SERIES

The Barnard series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in mixed lacustrine and alluvial sediments derived from mixed rocks.  They are on terraces or terrace pediments and have slopes of 0 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Argiduridic Durixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Barnard silt loam - pasture.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 18 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak thin platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (15 to 28 cm thick)

    AB--18 to 36 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak thin platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; few krotovinas; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 20 cm thick)

    2Bt--36 to 56 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) silty clay, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine prismatic parting to moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; few mycelial threads of calcium carbonate in lower part; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (15 to 53 cm thick)

    2Bkqm--56 to 76 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) indurated hardpan, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; platy; extremely hard and extremely firm; laminar capping on surface and on plates; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 60 cm thick)

    3C--76 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) very gravelly loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Baker County, Oregon; about 2 miles west of Richland on the south side of the road, NE corner of the NW1/4NE1/4 sec. 21, T. 9 S., R. 45 E.; latitude 44 degrees 46 minutes 34 seconds N and longitude 117 degrees 12 minutes 29 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 44.7759970 latitude, -117.2080030 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Soil moisture: Moist in some part between 10 and 30 cm for as long as 60 consecutive days during the winter months; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 12 degrees C.
Depth to the duripan: 50 to 100 cm.  

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 35 to 50 percent.
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent gravel.

A horizon
Value: 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry. 
Chroma: 2 or 3 moist and dry.  
Reaction: Slightly acid through slightly alkaline.  

2Bt horizon 
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR. 
Value: 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist. 
Chroma: 2 or 4 dry and moist.  
Texture: Heavy silty clay loam, silty clay, clay, or cobbly clay loam.  Structure: weak, moderate, or strong prismatic and moderate or strong blocky.  
Other features: It is calcareous in the lower part in some pedons.  

Bkqm 
Value: 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3.  
Cementation: Indurated throughout or indurated in the upper few centimeters and weakly or strongly cemented below; silica cemented or carbonate-silica cemented. 
Thickness of the cemented horizon ranges from: 8 to 60 cm, but generally it is 15 to 25 cm thick.
Structure: Massive or platy.  

3C horizon 
Texture: Stratified very gravelly loam, very gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly loamy sand, very gravelly loamy coarse sand, or cobbly loam.  
Rock fragments: 0 to 20 percent cobbles and 10 to 35 percent gravel.  
Reaction: Slightly alkaline through strongly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Adios, Decan, Ollierivas, Uana and Xerta series.  

Adios, Ollierivas and Xerta soils have hard bedrock underlying the duripan.  Decan and Uana soils are moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative during the period July through October due to summer convection storms.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Barnard soils are on terraces and fan and terrace pediments.  They formed in mixed lacustrine and alluvial sediments derived from mixed rocks. Some areas of this soil have an influence of volcanic ash in the surface layer.  Elevation is 700 to 1,555 meters.  In California and Nevada it ranges to 1,895 meters.  Slope is 0 to 45 percent.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C.  The mean annual precipitation is 230 to 330 mm.  The frost-free period is 80 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Balm, Delma, Lookout, Ruckles, and Ruclick soils.  Balm soils are on bottom lands and are somewhat poorly drained.  Delma soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 50 cm.  Lookout soils have ochric epipedons.  Ruckles soils are clayey-skeletal and shallow over basalt.  Ruclick soils are clayey-skeletal and moderately deep over basalt.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Irrigated cropland, hay, pasture, and range. Native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, and Thurber needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Oregon, southwestern Idaho, northern Nevada and northeastern California; MLRA 10, 21, 24, 25, 26, 27.  The soils of this series are of moderate extent.
