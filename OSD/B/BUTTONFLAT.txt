BUTTONFLAT SERIES

The BUTTONFLAT series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from interbedded sedimentary rocks.  These soils are on floodplain steps.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Cumulic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Buttonflat silty clay loam in irrigated hayland. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

 A--0 to 12 cm; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) silty clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) dry; weak fine granular structure; soft, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; finely disseminated carbonates; very slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual smooth boundary. (6 to 12 centimeters thick)

 Bw1--12 to 39 cm; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) silty clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; finely disseminated carbonates; very slightly effervescent;  slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.

 Bw2--39 to 90 cm; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) silty clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; very slightly effervescent;  5 percent few fine distinct yellowish red (5YR 4/6) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bw horizons is 35 to 105 centimeters)

 BC--90 to 117 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine roots; common fine tubular pores; very slightly effervescent; 15 percent common fine irregular carbonate masses in the matrix; 15 percent common medium prominent yellowish red (5YR 4/6) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 40 centimeters thick)

 Cg1--117 to 140 cm; dark gray (7.5YR 4/1) loam, brown (7.5YR 5/2) dry; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; finely disseminated carbonates; reduced matrix; 10 percent common medium prominent yellowish red (5YR 4/6) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; very slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (20 to 30 centimeters thick)

 Cg2--140 to 200 cm; very dark gray (7.5YR 3/1) gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) dry; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; finely disseminated carbonates; reduced matrix; 30 percent many coarse distinct yellowish red (5YR 4/6) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; very slightly effervescent; 25 percent rounded gravels; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.
