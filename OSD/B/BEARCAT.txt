BEARCAT SERIES

The Bearcat series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from mudstone, sandstone, and siltstone.  Bearcat soils are on mountains. Slopes range from 9 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1285 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Athena, La Grande, Tucannon and Wingville soils.  Athena soils have redoximorphic features greater than 100 centimeters deep.  La Grande soils are 100 to 150 centimeters deep.  Tucannon soils are 50 to 100 centimeters to bedrock.  Wingville soils have redoximorphic features above 50 centimeters.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bearcat soils are on mountain summits and gentle to steep slopes. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. Elevations are 60 to 520 meters. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from mudstone with minor amounts of siltstone and sandstone. The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1040 to 1530 millimeters. Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C, mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C, and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C. Frost free season is about 240 to 330 days.
 
GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ferncat), Darkprairie, Oilcreek, and Sleepyhollow, soils.  Ferncat soils have a difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature of less than 6 degrees C. Darkprairie, Oilcreek and Sleepyhollow soils lack redoximorphic features within 100 centimeters of the surface.  Darkprairie soils are on gently sloping open prairies. Ferncat, Oilcreek and Sleepyhollow soils are on linear to convex positions on ridges and mountain slopes under conifer and hardwood forest. 
 
DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained, high to very high runoff, moderately high to high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 
 
USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Natural vegetation consists of California oatgrass, dogtail grass, foxtail fescue, tall oatgrass, plantain, and annual legumes. Invasion by Sitka spruce, redwood and other forest species occurs primarily in disturbed areas and along forest borders.

 
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coastal Redwood Belt; MLRA 4B. The series is not extensive.
