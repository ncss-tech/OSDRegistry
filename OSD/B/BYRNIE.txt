BYRNIE SERIES

The Byrnie series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived from reddish colored sandstone. These soils are on gently sloping to very steep hills and ridges. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid, shallow Ustic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Byrnie fine sandy loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A--0 to 4 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonplastic, nonsticky; common very fine and fine roots; common fine and very fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0);  clear smooth boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick.)

     C--4 to 15 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonplastic, nonsticky; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 19 inches thick.)

     Cr--15 inches; soft calcareous reddish brown sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION:  Uinta County, Wyoming.  Approximately 1,900 feet W and 2,280 feet south of the NE corner of Sec. 25, T17N, R121W. Neponset Reservoir NE, Utah, Quadrangle.  41 degrees 25 minutes 45 seconds north latitude and 111 degrees 4 minutes 53 seconds west longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Mean annual soil temperature:  40 to 45 degrees F.
Depth to the paralithic contact:  4 to 20 inches to weathered sandstone
The profile is usually calcareous throughout but may be leached in some pedons in the A horizon. 

Particle-size control section:  5 to 18 percent clay and 0 to 35 percent r

A horizon:
Hue:  2.5YR through 7.5YR
Value:  5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist
Chroma:  3 through 6 dry or moist
Texture:  sandy loam, fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam
Rock fragments:  0 to 35 percent gravel and cobble
Reaction:  slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline

C horizon:
Hue:  2.5YR to 7.5YR
Value:   4 through 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma:   4 through 6 dry or moist
Texture:  sandy loam or fine sandy loam
Rock fragments:  0 to 35 percent gravel or cobble
Allogenic calcium carbonate equivalent:  5 to 20 percent
Reaction:  slightly alkaline through strongly alkaline
Some pedons have a weak Bk horizon.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Blackhall, Blazon, Seaverson and Thermopolis series.

Blackhall, Blazon, and Seaverson:  have hue of 7.5YR or yellower
Thermopolis:  have particle-size control sections containing more  than 18 percent clay

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: slope alluvium over residuum derived from reddish colored sandstone
Landform:  gently sloping to very steep hills and ridges
Slopes:  2 to 60 percent
Elevation:  6000 to 7800 feet
Mean annual precipitation:  at the type location it is about 12 inches but ranges 10 to 15 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring in the spring and early summer months
Mean annual air temperature:  40 to 45 degrees F.
Frost-free period:  85 to 100 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Blazon and Thermopolis series.  The Blazon series are 7.5YR or yellower and are finer textured.  The Thermopolis series are finer textured.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well to somewhat excessively drained. Runoff is medium to very rapid.  Permeability is moderately rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION:  This soil is used principally for livestock grazing.  Native vegetation includes bluebunch wheatgrass, needleandthread, Indian ricegrass, and mountain mahogany.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern and western Wyoming, LRR D.  The series is of moderate extent.
