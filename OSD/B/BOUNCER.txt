BOUNCER SERIES

The Bouncer series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Bouncer soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Xeric Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bouncer gravelly loamy fine sand--woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 4 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loamy fine sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; single grained; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 25 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 cm thick)

    A2--4 to 8 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; strong thick and medium platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular pores and many very fine and fine vesicular pores; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 8 cm thick)

    Bt1--8 to 18 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular pores and common very fine interstitial pores; 55 percent gravel; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and bridging sand grains; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 cm thick)

    Bt2--18 to 25 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine through medium roots; few very fine tubular pores and common very fine interstitial pores; 65 percent gravel; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and bridging sand grains; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 10 cm thick)

    Cr--25 to 53 cm; highly weathered and fractured volcanic rocks with roots in fractures.

    R--53 cm; hard fractured volcanic rock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Mineral County, Nevada; approximately 2,450 feet north and 1,350 feet west of the southeast corner of section 24, T. 7 N., R. 29 E.; USGS Lucky Boy 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 27 minutes 00 seconds N and longitude 118 degrees 41 minutes 24 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.4501111 latitude, -118.6900000 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in winter and spring; dry summers and fall, except for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October due to convection storms; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 12 degrees C.
Depth to soft bedrock: 20 to 36 cm.
Depth to hard bedrock: 50 to 76 cm.

Control section - Clay content:  18 to 23 percent.
Rock fragments:  Average 35 to 60 percent, mainly gravel.

A horizon - Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.

Bt horizon - Hue:  7.5YR, or 10YR.
Value:  4 through 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4.
Clay content:  18 to 25 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Abalan, Alcan, Armoine, Berit, Entero, Flex, Ginex, Harvan, Penelas, Ravenell, Sedsked, Soar, Stodick and Zyzzi series. 

Abalan soils have secondary carbonate accumulation in the Bt horizon.  Alcan, Armoine and Zyzzi soils are dominated by 2 to 5 millimeter gravel and lack hard bedrock within 76 cm.  Berit, Entero, Ravenell and Stodick soils have more than 25 percent clay in the Bt horizon. Flex and Sedsked soils are not moist for 10 to 20 days between July and October due to convection storms. Ginex soils have a calcareous, mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline control section.  Harvan soils have densic materials at 30 to 50 cm. Penelas soils have more than 60 percent rock fragments in the control section. Soar soils have rock fragments that are mainly 2 to 5 mm granitic gravel.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bouncer soils are on mountain crests, shoulders and side slopes.  Bouncer soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,675 to 2,350 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 90 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Nupart and Lazan series.   These soils lack an argillic horizon and hard bedrock within 50 cm.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Woodland.  The vegetation is primarily singleleaf pinyon, Wyoming big sagebrush, Nevada ephedra and Sandberg bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  West-central Nevada.  These soils are not extensive. MLRA 29.
