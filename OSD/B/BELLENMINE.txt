Mascamp soils are dominated by stones and cobbles in the control section, are influenced by volcanic glass, and have secondary carbonates coats on bedrock.  Melling soils have a typic xeric soil moisture regime. Pernog soils have less than 50 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Realmcoy soils are not intermittently moist in the upper part for 10 to 20 days cumulative due to convection storms between July and September.

Shalcleav soils have bedrock within 30 cm, have mollic epipedons that include all of the Bt horizon and their particle-size control section is dominated by flagstones and channers.  Tractuff soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bellenmine soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from quartzite. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 2,010 to 2,680 meters. The climate is dry-subhumid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 500 mm.The mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C. The frost-free period is 40 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Basinpeak and Millan soils. These soils both have bedrock deeper than 150 cm.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Bellenmine soils are used for recreation, woodland and wildlife habitat. The potential native vegetation is mainly singleleaf pinyon, low sagebrush, and bluebunch wheatgrass. This site is correlated to Ecological Site F28AY075NV, Singleleaf pinyon-Utah juniper/low sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: East-central Nevada. MLRA 28A. These soils are not extensive with about 1,500 acres of the series mapped to date.
