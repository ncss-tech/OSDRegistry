BAGLEY SERIES

The Bagley series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  Bagley soils are on flood plains and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Cumulic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bagley clay loam - cropland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap--0 to 9 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium and fine granular structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)

    A1--9 to 24 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium angular and subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; many very fine roots; common fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth boundary.  (12 to 18 inches thick)

    A2--24 to 39 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; many very fine roots; common fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth boundary.  (12 to 25 inches thick)

    C--39 to 60 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; few fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2)

TYPE LOCATION:  Navajo County, Arizona; 1,320 feet south and 1,320 feet east of the northwest corner of section 24, T. 13 N., R. 21 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture:  Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July - September and December - February.  Driest during May and June.  Ustic aridic soil moisture regime.

Soil Temperature:  51 to 56 degrees F.

A horizon
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma:  2 or 3, dry or moist
Reaction:  Slightly or moderately alkaline
Organic matter:  Averages 1 percent or more; decreases irregularly with depth
Clay content:  More than 35 percent

C horizon
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma:  2 or 3, dry or moist
Texture:  Loam, clay loam
Clay content:  20 to 40 percent

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Jacques (AZ) and Rune (AZ) series.  Jacques soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower and have an aridic ustic soil moisture regime.  Rune soils have hue of 5YR or redder.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bagley soils are on flood plains and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium.  Elevations range from 5,000 to 6,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 49 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 130 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Claysprings, Tours and Trail soils.  Claysprings soils have bedrock at depths less than 20 inches.  Tours soils are fine-silty and Trail soils are sandy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; slow or moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Bagley soils are used for livestock grazing and irrigated cropland.  The present vegetation is alkali sacaton, vine mesquite, bottlebrush squirreltail, Indian ricegrass, galleta, spike dropseed, blue grama and fourwing saltbush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Arizona.  This series is of small extent.
