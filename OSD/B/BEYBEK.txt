Slopes range from 3 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 840 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other soils in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Beybek soils are on summits, shoulders, and backslopes of hills. They generally occupy convex areas on upper portions of hills. Slopes range from 3 to 30 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and/or residuum derived from marble. Elevation is 450 to 750 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 800 to 970 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 15 to 17 degrees C. The frost free season is 220 to 270 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aquariusmine, Mercercave, Tiger Creek, Millvilla, Wardsferry, Priestgrade, Moccasinhill, and Sanguinetti series. Aquariusmine is found on lower portions of the hillslope and are deep to a lithic contact. Mercercave and Tiger Creek are mesic soils, occupying cooler aspects and higher elevations. Mercercave is deep. Tiger Creek is fine-loamy and has hues as red as 10R. Millvilla, Wardsferry, Priestgrade, Moccasinhill, and Sanguinetti develop from schist, phyllite and other metasedimentary rocks. Millvilla and Wardsferry are fine-loamy whereas Priestgrade, Moccasinhill, and Sanguinetti are loamy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately low to high saturated hydraulic conductivity in the surface horizon, and moderately low to moderately high in the subsurface horizons. Saturated hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock is low to very high. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and recreation. Vegetation consists of hardwoods, mainly blue oak, with an understory of annual grasses and forbs. Understory species include brome, clover, ryegrass, wild oat, and bedstraw. In some places the cover is dominated by shrubs, which is mostly chamise and likely a response to fire.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Foothills of California; MLRA 18. The series is not extensive.
