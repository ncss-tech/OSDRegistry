BUZZINI SERIES

The Buzzini series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from metasedimentary rocks. Buzzini soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 9 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2413 millimeters (95 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture: The soil is usually moist in all parts in the soil moisture control section in most years, but becomes nearly dry in the upper part from about September 15 to October 15 in most years. The soils have a udic moisture regime.

Soil Temperature: The mean annual soil temperature is 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F). The difference between mean summer and mean winter temperature is 2 to 4 degrees C.  The soils have an isomesic temperature regime.

Umbric epipedon is 25 to 60 centimeters thick.

Organic Matter: There is 12 to 25 kg per square meter of organic carbon to a depth of one meter.

CEC to clay ratio is 16 to 24 meq/100g in the major part of the argillic horizon.

Reaction is strongly or very strongly acid throughout. Base saturation is
5 to 35 percent between depths of 25 to 200 centimeters.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Trailhead series. Trailhead soils have an ochric epipedon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Buzzini soils occur on broad ridges and upper slopes of hill s and mountains. Slopes are 9 to 50 percent. Elevations are 62 to 576 meters (203 to 1,890 feet). The soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from metasedimentary rocks. The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters. Coastal influence limits the annual and diurnal range in temperature. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 2286 to 3302 millimeters (90 to 130 inches). Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free season is 240 to 300 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Sasquatch and the Sisterrocks soils. Sasquatch soils are 10YR to 7.5YR throughout and have less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Sisterrocks soils are 10YR to 7.5YR throughout and have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. The Sasquatch soils are in broad hollows and on steeper slopes below the Buzzini soils. The Sisterrocks soils are on convex areas below the Buzzini soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; high to very high runoff; moderately low to low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil has been used for commercial timber and is used for recreation, wildlife and watershed. Natural vegetation consists of redwood, Douglas fir, western hemlock, tanoak, huckleberry, and western swordfern.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: California Coastal Redwood Belt; MLRA 4B. The series is not extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Del Norte County, California 2012. Proposed 2007. Source of name is from Buzzini Lane north of the town of Crescent City.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

1. Umbric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 28 centimeters (A horizon)
2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 28 to 200 centimeters (BA, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 & CBt horizons)
3. Ultisol feature - base saturation of less than 35 percent at the critical depth, 125 centimeters below the upper boundary of the argillic horizon
4. Humult feature  greater than 22 kilograms per square meter of organic carbon to a depth of 1 meter
5. Palehumult features - Clay remains at least 85 percent of its maximum to a depth of 200 centimeters
6. Particle-size control section - the zone from 28 to 78 centimeters, averages 41 percent clay, by weight, and 13 percent rock fragments, by volume.

ADDITIONAL DATA: The Trailhead type pedon, a similar soil, is field sample number S83-CA-12-01, analyzed at Oregon State University and at NSSL. Backup samples S83-CA-12-02 and S83-CA-12-03 were analyzed for mineralogy class at NSSL. University of California samples 60-CA-12-17X and 60-CA-12-18X were collected for the Soil-Vegetation Survey in Redwood National Park.

Soil classified using the 11th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.
