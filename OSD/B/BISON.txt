BISON SERIES

The Bison series consists of moderately deep to hardpan, well drained soils on fan terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium from limestone.  Slope is 2 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 56 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Calcic Petrocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Bison gravelly loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 4 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) gravelly loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak thick platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0) abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 5 inches thick)

    Bw--4 to 8 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) gravelly loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel with lime coatings dominantly on the undersides; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

    Bk1--8 to 13 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) gravelly loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel with lime coatings dominantly on the undersides; violently effervescent, many large irregularly shaped soft lime masses; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 20 inches thick)

    Bk2--13 to 26 inches; pink (7.5YR 8/4) gravelly loam, reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) moist; strong fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel with lime coating dominantly on the undersides; violently effervescent, few fine soft lime masses; moderately alkaline (pH8.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 15 inches thick)

    2Bkm--26 to 38 inches; pink (7.5YR 8/4) indurated lime cemented petrocalcic, reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) moist; massive; extremely hard, extremely firm; few very fine roots in fractures; abrupt wavy boundary.  (8 to 30 inches thick)

    3Bk--38 to 60 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) gravelly loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine tubular pores; 25 percent lime coated gravel; weakly lime cemented; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bison soils are on fan terraces at elevations of 3,600 to 4,400 feet.  They formed in alluvium from limestone.  Slopes range from 2 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 7 to 11 inches.   Mean annual air temperature is about 55 to 57 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 165 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Curob, Clayhole, Kinan, Pennell, Monue and Seeg soils.  Curob soils are shallow to a hardpan.  Pennell soils are shallow to bedrock.  Clayhole, Kinan, Monue and Seeg soils are very deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for livestock grazing.  Present vegetation is galleta, sand dropseed, blue grama and fourwing saltbush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Arizona.  The Bison series is of moderate extent. MLRA 35.
