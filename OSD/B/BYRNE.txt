BYRNE SERIES

The Byrne series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in 35 to 75 centimeters (14 to 30 inches) of glaciolacustrine deposits over till.  These soils are on nearly level or slightly convex slopes on side slopes on moraines and lake plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C (42 degrees F).  Mean annual precipitation is about 610 millimeters (24 inches).

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Swift County, Minnesota, 2000.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters (10 to 39 inches);
Series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 183 centimeters (0 to 72 inches).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 25 centimeters (10 inches) (Ap horizon); 
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 25 to 58 centimeters (10 to 23 inches) (Bw horizon); 
calcic horizon--the zone from a depth of 58 to 102 centimeters (23 to 40 inches). (Bk1 and  2Bk2 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

These soils were previously identified as Doland, moderately wet phase.

Edits made 3/2011 (TWN)--location of typical pedon changed to more centralized location, converted to metric system, and format changed to semi-tabular.
