MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Frederick County, Maryland, August 1997.The name Burkittsville is taken from a small community in the area.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:
Ochric epipedon - from a depth of 0 to 10 inches (Ap horizon).
Argillic horizon - from a depth of 10 to 35 inches (Btl and Bt2 horizons).
Paralithic contact below a depth of 60 inches.

Burkittsville soils were formerly included with the Myersville and Fauquier soils in the 1960 Frederick County soil survey.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Particle size, bulk density, chemical and mineralogical analyses available on pedon S86MD021-1 and PSA on Ap and Bt horizons of pedon S97MD021-1 from University of Maryland Soil Characterization Lab.
