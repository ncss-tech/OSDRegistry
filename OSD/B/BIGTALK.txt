BIGTALK SERIES

The Bigtalk series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from anorthosite and gneiss on mountain slopes. Permeability is moderate and slopes range from 15 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 34 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Humic Eutrudepts

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Langhei series. The Langhei soils contain carbonates and do not have Bt horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bigtalk soils are on mountain slopes at elevations of 1,600 to 3,600 feet. Slopes are 15 to 65 percent. These soils formed in material from anorthsite and gneiss. The average annual temperature is 38 to 44 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is 30 to 45 inches. The frost-free season is 50 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Floodwood, Keeler, Longbar and Noil series. Floodwood soils are on gentle mountain slopes and have a thin volcanic ash cap. Keeler soils are on mountain slopes and have 2Bt horizons. Longbar soils are on mountain slopes and have a mollic epipedon.
Noil soils are on steep mountain slopes, are loamy-skeletal, and deep to a paralithic contact.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, rapid to very rapid runoff, moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, reacreation, watershed, and wildlife habitat. Potential natural vegetation is grand fir, Douglas-fir, western larch, and Rocky Mountain maple, with an understory of wild ginger, queencup beadlily, starry false Solomons seal, American trailplant, goldthread, snow raspberry, bracken fern, bunchberry dogwood, western rattlesnake plantain, western swordfern, broadleaved montia, and mountain thermopsis.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Idaho. Bigtalk soils are not extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Clearwater County, Idaho, 2003.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from the mineral soil surface to 8 inches (A horizons).

Cambic horizon - the zone from 8 to 48 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 and BC horizons).

Particle-size control section - the zone from 11 to 41 inches (part of Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 and part of the BC horizons).

The 11/2010 revision reflects a reclassification from Typic Eutrudepts to Humic Eutrudepts subgroup based on revisions to the 11th Edition Keys to Soil Taxonomy. No other changes were made during this revision.
