BECKMAN SERIES

The Beckman series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in recent calcareous and saline clayey alluvium over Permian age shales and claystones.  These soils are on nearly level flood plains of minor drains of the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA-78B, 78C).  Slope is 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches.

COMPETING SERIES: These are no series in the same family.  Similar soils are the Mangum, Throck, Tilvern, Treadway, and Vernon series.  Mangum soils: These soils occur on slightly higher flood plains, have vertic properties in the upper 40 inches, and are well drained.  Throck, Tilvern, and Vernon soils: do not have a gypsic horizon, are well drained, and occur on upland hillslopes.  Treadway soils: are well drained and occur on alluvial fans and foot slopes.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: recent calcareous and saline clayey alluviumover Permian age shales and claystones
Landform: nearly level flood plains of minor drains
Slope: 0 to 1 percent
Mean annual air temperature range: 57 to 64 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation range: 22 to 32 inches
Frost-free period: 190 to 230 days
Elevation: 1300 to 2100 feet
Thornthwaite annual P-E indices: 32 to 44

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Clairemont, Heman, Knoco, Mangum, Spur, Tilvern, Treadway, Vernon, and Wheatwood series.  
Clairemont, Spur, and Wheatwood soils: occur on similar areas but are well drained and have less than 35 percent clay content in the control section.
Heman soils: occur on similar areas but have strongly contrasting particle-size classes in the control section.
Mangum soils: occur on slightly higher areas, have vertic properties in the upper 40 inches, and are well drained.
Knoco, Tilvern, and Vernon soils: occur on adjacent uplands, are well drained, and are less than 60 inches thick over shale.
Treadway soils: occur on alluvial fans and foot slopes and are well drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Beckman soils are moderately well drained.  Permeability is very slow.  Runoff is high.  These soils are occasionally or frequently flooded for very brief periods during April through October. A fluctuating water table occurs between 3 and 6 feet of the surface during the months of October to May in most years.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly as grazing land for beef cattle.  Alkali sacaton, inland saltgrass, vine mesquite, and western wheatgrass are the dominant native grasses, and tamarisk is the primary invader.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Rolling Red Plains of western Oklahoma, northwest Texas and possibly Kansas; LRR H; MLRA 78B, 78C; The series is of minor extent
