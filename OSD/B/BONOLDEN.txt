BONOLDEN SERIES

The Bonolden series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium from mixed rocks.  Bonolden soils are on alluvial fans and alluvial flats.  The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Pachic Calcixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bonolden silt loam - cropland.  (Colors are for moist soils unless otherwise stated.)

    Ap--0 to 7 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) silt loam; brown (10YR 5/3) dry; weak coarse subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine and medium subangular blocky; soft, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; slightly effervescent (16 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 10 inches thick)

    A--7 to 22 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam; brown (10YR 5/3) dry; moderate coarse subangular  blocky structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; many very fine and fine and few medium and coarse tubular pores; slightly effervescent (14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. (6 to 15 inches thick.)

    AB--22 to 36 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) silt loam; brown (10YR 5/3) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; many very fine and fine and few medium tubular pores; slightly effervescent (15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual irregular boundary.  (10 to 23 inches thick)

    Bk--36 to 60 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) silt loam; pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine and few medium tubular pores; strongly effervescent (25 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), calcium carbonate occurs as masses and veins; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2). (20 to 30 inches thick)

TYPE LOCATION:  Millard County, Utah; about 2 miles north of the town of Holden; 1300 feet south and 4100 feet east of the northwest corner of section 26, R.4W., T.19S. lat. 39 degrees 06 minutes 25 seconds N. and long. 112 degrees 16 minutes 23 seconds W.; NAD83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Soil moisture: Moist in some part of the moisture control section for more than one-half of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. The soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Xeric soil moisture regime.
Soil temperature: 50 to 54 degrees F.
Mean summer soil temperature: 68 to 74 degrees F.  

Mollic epipedon thickness: 20 to 40 inches. 

Particle size control section (weighted average): 
Clay content: 18 to 27 percent.
Sand fraction: Less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.

A horizons:
Value: 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.
Reaction: Slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline.
Effervescence: Slightly effervescent.

AB or Bw horizon (when present):
Value: 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist. 
Chroma: 2 or 3.
Texture: Silt loam or loam.
Reaction: Slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline. 
Effervescence: Slightly effervescent to strongly effervescent.

Bk horizon:
Hue: 10YR to 7.5YR
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: Silt loam or loam
Reaction: Slightly to strongly alkaline 
Effervescence: Strongly effervescent.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 15 to 30 percent.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Kearnsar (T Id) series. 
Kearnsar soils have redoximorphic features and a watertable at 3.5 to 6 feet.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bonolden soils occur on nearly level to sloping alluvial fans and alluvial flats at elevations of 4800 to 5600 feet. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The soils formed in mixed alluvium, primarily from sandstone, limestone and quartzite. The climate is dry subhumid with 12 to 16 inches of annual precipitation and 110 to 150 frost free days. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 48 to 52 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bandag, Calita, Erda, Hansel, Sterling, and Taylorsflat soils. Bandag, Hansel and Taylorsflat soils have ochric epipedons. Sterling soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments. Calita and Erda soils have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Cropland for alfalfa and seeded rangeland. Native vegetation is big sagebrush, Indian ricegrass, and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Utah. The series is of small extent. MLRA 28A.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon (pachic): The zone from the surface to 36 inches. (Ap, A, and Bw horizons)

Calcic horizon: The zone from 36 to 60 inches. (Bk horizon)

The classification is based on the "Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006".
