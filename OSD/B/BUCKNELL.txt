BUCKNELL SERIES

The Bucknell series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in a partially truncated, exhumed paleosol that developed in till. These soils are on convex shoulder slopes and side slopes on dissected till plains. Slope ranges from 5 to 40 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 millimeters.

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are cultivated. The principal crops are corn, oats, and soybeans.  Steeper slopes typically are pastured, wooded or both wooded and pastured.  The native vegetation is mixed prairie grasses and deciduous trees.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Monroe County, Iowa, 1982.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 75 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include: 
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 18 centimeters (Ap horizon); 
argillic horizon--the zone from 25 centimeters to a depth of 109 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons);
aquic moisture regime.

Differentiation between the Bucknell and Rinda soils needs further study.
