(3 to 16 inches thick)

    C--18 to 60 inches, (46 to 152 cm); grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) stratified very fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, and fine sandy loam; massive; very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) mottles; common mica flakes; neutral (pH 6.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  North Star Area, Alaska; in the SE 1/4 of the NW 1/4 of Section 25., T.1N., R.4E., Fairbanks Meridian.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Thickness of the solum: 11 to 36 inches, 28 to 91 cm
Loess mantle mica Content: substantial but less than 25 percent by weight 
Mean annual soil temperature: 32 to 34 degrees F., 0 to 1.1 C.
Reaction class: strongly acid to neutral in mineral soil

A horizon:
Matrix color: hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 2 to 5; chroma of 2 to 4
Texture: silt loam, very fine sandy loam, and strata of fine sandy loam and loamy fine sand.

Bw horizons:
Matrix color: hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 3 to 6; chroma of 1 to 6
Texture: silt loam, very fine sandy loam, and strata of fine sandy loam and loamy fine sand 

BC or C horizons (where present)
Matrix color: hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 1 to 4

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Eska, Ganhona, Kalambach, Mine, Sambrito, Southpaw, Steese, Tebay, and Tsana series. Eska, Ganhona, Southpaw, and Tsana soils lack visible mica in the solum. Kalambach soils have greater than 35 percent coarse fragments in the lower part of the control section. Mine soils lack stratified textures. Steese soils have bedrock within 20 to 40 inches. Sambrito soils have MAST greater than 37 degrees F. Tebay soils have sola less than 9 inches thick.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loess over alluvium or fluvial deposits reworked by wind
Landform: stream terraces, plains, terraces, or hills
Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent
Climate: subarctic with long cold winters and short warm summers
Mean annual temperature: 24 to 28 degrees F., -4.4 to 2.2 C.
Mean annual precipitation: 10 to 14 inches, 254 to 356 mm

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, runoff low to medium runoff, saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high
 
USE AND VEGETATION: Some areas are cleared and used for grasses. Bohica soils have native vegetation of white spruce, paper birch, and quaking aspen.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 229 Interior Alaska Lowlands, Alaska. The series is of minor extent.
