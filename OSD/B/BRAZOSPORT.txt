BRAZOSPORT SERIES

The Brazosport series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, high saturated hydraulic conductivity (rapidly permeable) soils that formed in eolian beach sands. These nearly level soils occur on back-barrier flats and remnants of back-barrier flats adjacent to tidal flats on barrier islands. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1245 mm (49 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 21degrees C (70 degrees F).

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES PROPOSED: Galveston County, Texas, 2020. The name is from a municipality near the type location.

REMARKS: The series was formerly included in the Mustang series. The series was separated based on differences in water table depth, and salinity.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: 25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in) 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 in) (A horizon) 
Endosaturation and aquic conditions: 37 to 203 cm (15 to 80 in) (C2,Cg,2Cg1 and 2Cg2 horizons)
Lithologic discontinuity: 115 to 203 cm (45 to 80 in). 

Additional Comments: The lithologic discontinuity is evident as an increase in clay due to the Beaumont Formation and ancient Brazos River. This paleo-surface is deeper in pedons on Galveston Island and shallower on the southwest end of Follets Island.

ADDITIONAL DATA: TAMU soil characterization lab data from a representative location S95TX167001. MLRA Soil Survey Office data are available on location S2020TX0397031 at the series type location.
