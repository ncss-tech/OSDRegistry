BARRONETT SERIES

The Barronett series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in silty lacustrine deposits. These soils are on stream terraces and glacial lake plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Mollic Epiaqualfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Barronett silt loam, on a nearly level slope of 1 percent, in a cultivated field, at an elevation of about 379 meters above sea level.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Ap--0 to 23 centimeters; black (10YR 2/1) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine roots; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.

   Eg--23 to 41 centimeters; gray (10YR 6/1) silt loam; weak thick platy structure parting to weak medium and fine subangular blocky; few fine roots; few fine prominent reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8) masses of iron accumulation; few earthworm casts; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary.

   Btg1--41 to 58 centimeters; gray (10YR 6/1) silt loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; common clay films on faces of peds and in pores; common fine prominent reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8) and few fine prominent red (2.5YR 4/6) masses of iron accumulation; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary.

   Btg2--58 to 86 centimeters; gray (10YR 6/1) silt loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; few clay films on faces of peds and in pores; few fine prominent yellowish red (5YR 4/6) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. 

   Cg--86 to 152 centimeters; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) stratified silt and very fine sand; massive breaking to weak thick plates along depositional strata; very friable; few fine prominent yellowish red (5YR 4/6) and distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation; slightly acid.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Campia, Comstock, and Crystal Lake soils.
Campia--are on higher landscape positions and do not have a frequently saturated zone within a depth of 1.8 meters during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Comstock--are on slightly higher landscape positions and have a frequently saturated zone between depths of 0.3 and 0.75 meter during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Crystal Lake--are on higher landscape positions and have a frequently saturated zone between depths of 0.75 and 1.0 meter during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of 30 year mean of annual precipitation

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class--poorly drained--these soils are frequently saturated from the surface of the soil to a depth of 0.3 meter during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of 30 year mean of annual precipitation, this saturation is considered both perched and apparent
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--4.00 to 42.00 micrometers per second in the upper sediments and 1.00 to 4.00 micrometers per second in the underlying stratified sediments
Flooding--not flooded to rarely flooded for brief duration
Ponding--frequently ponded to a depth of 0.15 meter for long duration during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of 30 year mean of annual precipitation

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Most areas are pastured or managed for hay production. Drained areas are cultivated. The principal crops are corn, small grain, and hay. The native vegetation is sedges and grasses with scattered American elm, black ash, aspen, and willows.
