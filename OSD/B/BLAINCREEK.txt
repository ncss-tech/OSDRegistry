BLAINCREEK SERIES

The Blaincreek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium or residuum derived from igneous and sedimentary bedrock. These soils are on hills, mountain slopes, escarpments, structural benches, and strath terraces. Slopes range from 4 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 432 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Blaincreek gravelly loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

 A--0 to 10 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/2) gravelly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak very thin platy structure parting to weak very fine granular; soft, very friable, moderately sticky, slightly plastic; many very fine roots; 25 percent angular and rounded gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 18 cm thick)

 Bt1--10 to 30 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/2) gravelly clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to fine and medium subangular blocky; hard, firm, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; 30 percent angular and rounded gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual smooth boundary.

 Bt2--30 to 61 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/2) very gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; many distinct dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) clay films on faces of peds; 50 percent angular and rounded gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 25 to 89 cm)

 R--61 cm; fractured igneous bedrock, few cracks, few very fine roots in some cracks; thin carbonate coats on bottom surfaces of rock fractures.
