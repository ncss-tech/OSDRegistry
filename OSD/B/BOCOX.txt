BOCOX SERIES

The Bocox series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately permeable soils. These level to very gently sloping soils formed in loamy alluvium or eolian sediments of Pleistocene age. These soils occur on depressional areas on alluvial plains of the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 16.1 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 in).
