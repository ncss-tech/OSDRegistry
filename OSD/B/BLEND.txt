DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage--poorly drained--a saturated zone occurs within a depth of 1 foot during March to June in most years and is considered apparent
Permeability--very slow
Surface runoff potential--low or very low
Flooding--rare flooding for brief periods during the months of February to November from precipitation events and snowmelt

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are cultivated. The principal crops are corn and soybeans. Nearly all areas of Blend soils are drained by surface ditches. A few areas are land graded. The native vegetative cover is a herbaceous wetland community commonly inhabited with Bluejoint Grasses, White Cutgrasses, Fox Sedges, Oval Sedges, Inland Rushes, Torreys Rushes, Dark Green Bulrushes, Flatstem Spikerushes, Blue Vervains, Indian Hemps, Winged Loosestrifes, Wild Mints, and Water Horehounds.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
LRR M, MLRA 107; Blend soils are on the highest level of the Missouri River flood plain in Iowa, commonly in areas that are near or within the backswamps or swales produced by meander scars which border or extend a few miles from upland foot slopes. These soils are of large extent.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 10 to 40 inches (A, 2Bg1, 2Bg2, and 3Ab horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 60 inches (Ap, A, 2Bg1, 2Bg2, 3Ab, and 3Bgb horizons).

Diagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 14 inches (Ap and A horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 14 to 32 inches (2Bg1 and 2Bg2 horizons);
aquic moisture regime.

Vertic subgroup based on linear extensibility greater than 6.0 cm between the surface and a depth of 39 inches (100 cm). Fluvaquentic subgroup based on an irregular decrease in organic-carbon content within the zone from a depth of 10 (25 cm) to 50 inches (125 cm).

Taxonomy version--second edition, 1999.

Classification was changed from Fluvaquentic Endoaquolls to Fluvaquentic Vertic Endoaquolls in 2002 based on data from the Woodbury County, Iowa soil survey update.
