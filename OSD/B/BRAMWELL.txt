BRAMWELL SERIES



The Bramwell series consists of very deep somewhat poorly drained soils

on floodplains and low terraces.  They formed in mixed alluvium.

Permeability is slow.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The average annual

precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual temperature is

about 51 degrees F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquic Haplocalcids



TYPICAL PEDON:  Bramwell silt loam - pasture.  (Colors are for dry soil

unless otherwise noted.)



    Ap--0 to 10 inches; light gray (10YR 6/1) silt loam, dark gray

(10YR 4/1) moist; moderate thin platy structure; slightly hard,

friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; many

very fine and fine vesicular pores; slightly effervescent; strongly

alkaline (pH 8.8); clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 14 inches thick)



    Bk1--10 to 19 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam,

dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure

parting to weak or moderate fine angular blocky; hard, firm, sticky and

plastic; few fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; few thin

darker organic coatings on peds; strongly effervescent; very strongly

alkaline (pH 9.3); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 18 inches thick)



    Bk2--19 to 29 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) silt loam, dark grayish

brown (10YR 4/2) moist; common medium and coarse distinct pale brown

(10YR 6/3) staining, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium platy

structure parting to weak fine subangular blocky; very hard, firm,

sticky and plastic; few fine roots; common very fine tubular pores;

strongly effervescent with common fine and medium distinct white (10YR

8/2) calcium carbonate splotches; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.1);

gradual smooth boundary.  (8 to 12 inches thick)



    Bk3--29 to 39 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) silt loam, light olive

brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; common medium and coarse distinct pale brown

(10YR 6/3) staining, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium platy

structure parting to moderate very fine angular blocky; very hard,

firm, sticky and plastic; few fine roots; few very fine tubular pores;

violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.7); gradual smooth

boundary.  (8 to 15 inches thick)



    C--39 to 60 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) silt loam, grayish brown

(2.5Y 5/2) moist; few faint pale brown (10YR 6/3) stains, brown (10YR

5/3) moist; moderate thin platy structure parting to moderate very fine

angular blocky; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine roots; few

very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH

8.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to 12 inches thick)



TYPE LOCATION:  Gem County, Idaho; about 8 miles west of Emmett, 2,540

feet north and 1,820 feet east of the southwest corner of section 2,

T. 6 N., R. 3 W.

Control section percent clay - 18 to 30

Control Section Texture - SIL, SICL

Reaction - moderately to very strongly alkaline



Bk horizon

Hue - 2.5Y or 10YR

Value - 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist

Chroma - 2 or 3

Calcium carbonate equivalent - 15 to 30 percent



C horizon

Hue - 2.5Y or 10YR

Value - 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the similar Bram and Gooch series.  Bram

soils are in a coarse-silty family and Gooch soils area in a fine-loamy

family.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bramwell soils are on level to gently sloping low

stream or lacustrine terraces and floodplains.  They formed in silty

alluvium and lacustrine sediments.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.

Elevation is 2,000 to 4,000 feet.  Summers are hot and dry and winters

are cool and moist.  Average annual precipitation is 7 to 12 inches.

Average annual temperature is 48 to 54 degrees F.  Frost-free season is

110 to 160 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Baldock, Bram,

Lahontan, and Letha soils.  Baldock soils are fine-loamy .  Bram soils

are coarse-silty.  Lahontan soils are fine, montmorillonitic.  Letha

soils are coarse-loamy.  All of these soils occupy similar landscape

positions.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; slow runoff; slow

permeability.  A high water table is at 2 to 3.5 feet sometime during

the months of May through September.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for pasture, hay, small grains, and corn;

some areas remain in greasewood, saltgrass, and wildrye.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwest Idaho and parts of Nevada and

Utah.  The series is moderately extensive.
