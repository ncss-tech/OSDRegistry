BRAMWELL SERIES

The Bramwell series consists of very deep somewhat poorly drained soils on floodplains and low terraces.  They formed in mixed alluvium.  Permeability is slow.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches (230 mm) and the mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F (11 degrees C).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bramwell silt loam - pasture.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap--0 to 10 inches (0 to 25 cm); gray (10YR 6/1) silt loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; moderate thin platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; many very fine and fine vesicular pores; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 14 inches (15 to 36 cm thick)

    Bk1--10 to 19 inches (25 to 48 cm); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak or moderate fine angular blocky; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; few thin darker organic coatings on peds; strongly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.3); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 18 inches (20 to 46 cm) thick)

    Bk2--19 to 29 inches (48 to 74 cm); light gray (2.5Y 7/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; common medium and coarse distinct pale brown (10YR 6/3) staining, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium platy structure parting to weak fine subangular blocky; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent with common fine and medium distinct very pale brown (10YR 8/2) calcium carbonate splotches; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.1); gradual smooth boundary.  (8 to 12 inches (20 to 30 cm) thick)

    Bk3--29 to 39 inches (74 to 99 cm); light gray (2.5Y 7/2) silt loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; common medium and coarse distinct pale brown (10YR 6/3) staining, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium platy structure parting to moderate very fine angular blocky; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.7); gradual smooth boundary.  (8 to 15 inches (20 to 38 cm) thick)

    C--39 to 60 inches (99 to 152 cm); light gray (2.5Y 7/2) silt loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; few faint pale brown (10YR 6/3) stains, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate thin platy structure parting to moderate very fine angular blocky; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to 12 inches (20 to 30 cm) thick)

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other soils in this family at this time.  Similar soils include the Bram and Gooch series.  Bram soils are in a coarse-silty family and Gooch soils are in a fine-loamy family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bramwell soils are on level to gently sloping low stream or lacustrine terraces and floodplains.  They formed in silty alluvium and lacustrine sediments.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Elevation is 2,000 to 4,000 feet (605 to 1210 m).  Summers are hot and dry and winters are cool and moist.  Average annual precipitation is 7 to 12 inches (180 to 305 mm). Average annual temperature is 48 to 54 degrees F (9 to 12 degrees C).  Frost-free season is 110 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Baldock, Bram, Lahontan, and Letha soils.  Baldock soils are fine-loamy .  Bram soils are coarse-silty.  Lahontan soils are fine, montmorillonitic.  Letha soils are coarse-loamy.  All of these soils occupy similar landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; slow runoff; slow permeability.  A high water table is at 2 to 3.5 feet sometime during the months of May through September.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for pasture, hay, small grains, and corn; some areas remain in greasewood, saltgrass, and wildrye.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwest Idaho and parts of Nevada and Utah.  The series is moderately extensive.
