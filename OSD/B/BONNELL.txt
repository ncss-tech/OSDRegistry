BONNELL SERIES

The Bonnell series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in less than 46 cm (18 inches) of loess or loamy materials and the underlying till. These soils are on dissected till plains. Slope ranges from 6 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1067 mm (42 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).

Beasley, Eden, Enott, Heverlo, and Shrouts soils have a paralithic contact within the series control section. Bledsoe and Vandalia soils have more than 5 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Brashear, Elba, and Jessup soils do not have rock fragments within the series control section of igneous lithology. Bratton, Bucklick, Caneyville, Donahue, Faywood, Fredonia, Haggatt, and Milton soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Cosperville and Muncie soils are less acid than strongly acid in the upper part of the argillic horizon. Estate soils have an argillic horizon with hues redder than 7.5YR. Heitt and Kewaunee soils are less than 102 cm (40 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Lowell and Markland soils average less than 18 percent sand in the particle-size control section. Mountpleasant soils have more than 8 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the solum.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bonnell soils are typically on shoulders and back slopes of dissected till plains, considered to be of the Illinoian stage. They formed in less than 46 cm (18 inches) of loess or loamy material from valley side alluvium, and the underlying till. Slope ranges from 6 to 60 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (51 to 57 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1143 mm (40 to 45 inches). Frost free period is 150 to 200 days. Elevation is 122 to 259 meters (400 to 850 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are commonly the Avonburg, Blocher, Cincinnati, Hickory and Nabb soils, and less commonly the Carmel and Eden soils. The somewhat poorly drained Avonburg soils are typically on nearly level summits. The moderately well drained Blocher soils are typically on shoulders and backslopes. The well drained Carmel, Eden and Hickory soils are on backslopes. The Carmel and Eden soils formed in residuum weathered from interbedded limestone and shale. The moderately well drained Cincinnati and Nabb soils are typically summits and shoulders, and have less clay in the upper part of the argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The potential for surface water runoff ranges from medium to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the lower part of the subsoil and moderately low or moderately high in the substratum. Permeability is moderately slow in the lower part of the subsoil and moderately slow or slow in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Bonnell soils are used for hay, pasture or woodland. A few areas are being used for growing small grain, corn or soybeans. Native vegetation is mixed hardwood forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Dominantly in MLRA 114A in south-central and south-eastern Indiana, and to a lesser extent in MLRA 121 in south-eastern Indiana and south-western Ohio. The series is of moderate extent.
