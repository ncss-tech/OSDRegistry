BAGGS SERIES 

The Baggs series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Baggs loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 10 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 12 inches thick) 

    Bw1--10 to 16 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. 

    Bw2--16 to 22 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of Bw horizons is 9 to 18 inches) 

    BC--22 to 31 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary. (7 to 22 inches thick) 

    C--31 to 60 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) fine sandy loam, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and very fine roots, few very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.2).

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT1535.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 10 inches (A horizon); a cambic horizon from 10 to 22 inches (Bw1, Bw2 horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bw1, Bw2 BC, C horizons).
