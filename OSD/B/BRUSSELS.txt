BRUSSELS SERIES 

The Brussels series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from limestone or dolomite with interbedded shale.  Permeability is moderately slow.  These soils are on uplands and have slopes of 14 to 90 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 38 inches. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Brussels very flaggy silty clay loam - on a 60 percent west-facing slope in hardwood forest at an elevation of 500 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

   A--0 to 5 inches; black (10YR 2/1) very flaggy silty clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; moderate very fine granular structure; firm; many fine roots; about 35 percent flagstones of limestone; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 13 inches thick) 

   Bw1--5 to 15 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) very flaggy silty clay, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; firm; many fine roots; 35 percent flagstones of limestone; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. 

   Bw2--15 to 35 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) very flaggy silty clay; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; firm; common fine roots; 40 percent flagstones of limestone; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. 

   Bw3--35 to 60 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) very flaggy silty clay loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; firm; common fine roots; 40 percent flagstones of limestone; moderately alkaline.  (Combined thickness of the Bw horizons is 50 inches to several feet.) 

TYPE LOCATION:  Lincoln County, Missouri; about 2 miles north of Troy; 1800 feet south and 100 feet west of the northeast corner of sec. 10, T. 49 N., R. 1 W.; USGS Okete quadrangle, lat. 38 degrees 01 minutes 38 seconds N. and long. 90 degrees 59 minutes 32 seconds W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 24 inches thick. 

The A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is flaggy, channery, gravelly, very flaggy, or very channery analogues of silty clay loam.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline. 

The Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3 where part of the mollic epipedon, otherwise value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is very flaggy, extremely flaggy, or very gravelly analogues of silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.  It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline. 

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  Similar series are the Goss and Snead series.  Goss soils do not have a mollic epipedon and have argillic horizons.  Snead soils have fewer rock fragments and are moderately deep to bedrock. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Brussels soils are on side slopes and foot slopes of hills. Slopes range from 14 to 90 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from limestone or dolomite with interbedded shale.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 58 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 45 inches. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bucklick, Gasconade and Goss soils.  Goss soils are higher on the slope. Bucklick soils have less coarse fragments and may be higher or lower on the slope. Gasconade soils are shallow to bedrock and are higher on the slope. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is medium to very high.  Permeability is moderately slow. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are in mixed oak and hickory.  Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeast Missouri Lincoln Fold Area (MLRA 115) and the Ozark Highlands (MLRA 116A) and Ozark Border (MLRA 116B) area of Missouri.  The series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lincoln County, Missouri, 1985. 

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series are:  mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 15 inches (A and Bw1 horizons) 
cambic horizon - the zone from approximately 15 inches to 60 inches or more (Bw2 and Bw3 horizons); 
udic moisture regime.
