BODACIOUS SERIES

The Bodacious series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in colluvium and alluvium over residuum derived from igneous and metamorphic rocks on foothills and mountain slopes. Slopes range from 10 to 60 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Lithic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Bodacious cobbly loam--rangeland. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.) The soil surface is covered with 30 percent cobbles and 10 percent gravel.

  A1--0 to 5 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) cobbly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few medium, common fine and few very fine roots; common medium and fine, many very fine interstitial pores; 25 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); and clear wavy boundary. (5 to 10 cm thick)

  A2--5 to 18 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common medium, fine and very fine roots; few medium, many fine and very fine interstitial pores; 35 percent cobbles and 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 15 cm thick)

  Bw--18 to 48 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very cobbly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; few medium, many fine and very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 40 percent cobbles and 15 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (15 to 33 cm thick)

  R--48 cm; hard igneous bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION: Iron County, Utah; about 1.6 km (1 mile) northeast of Rice Mountain in Hamlin Valley; located about 575 feet south and 500 feet west of the northeast corner, sec. 7, T. 32 S., R. 19 W.; Rice Mountain USGS quad; latitude 38 degrees 02 minutes 21 seconds N and longetude 114 degrees 0 minutes 34 seconds W; NAD 83

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: Moist in winter and spring and continuously dry in all parts for significant periods in summer and fall; xeric soil moisture regime bordering aridic.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8.0 to 10.5 degrees C. 
Mean summer soil temperature: 17.0 to 19.5 degrees C. 
Mollic epipedon thickness: 18 to 25 cm. 
Depth to bedrock: 30 to 50 cm.
Reaction: Neutral or slightly alkaline.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 18 to 27 percent. 
Rock fragments: 35 to 60 percent, mainly cobbles or gravel. 

Bw horizon
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR.
Value: 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist. 
Chroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist.
Texture: Loam, subhorizons of clay loam are in some pedons.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Aldax, Bakeoven, Bodell, Couleedam, Hendap, Johntom, Lickskillet, Limekiln, Plaskett, Rockly Sanikara, and Venator series. 

Aldax, Hendap Plaskett and Johntom soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Bakeoven and Rockly soils are 10 to 30 cm to bedrock.Bodell soils have a mean annual soil temperature that ranges to 13.0 degrees C and have 10 to 30 percent volcanic glass in the upper 10 to 15 cm. Couleedam soils have mean annual soil temperature of 10.5 to 11.5 degrees C. Lickskillet soils are dry for more than 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Limekiln soils have mollic epipedons that are 25 to 43 cm thick, Bkq horizons with soil reaction ranging from moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline. Plaskett soils have mean annual soil temperature of 13 to 14.5 degrees C. at the lithic contact. Sanikara soils have a typic xeric moisture regime and lack a Bw horizon. Venator soils have reactions that range to slightly acid and rock fragments that are primarily shale channers.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: colluvium and alluvium over residuum derived dominantly from mixed igneous and metamorphic rocks
Landform: Foothills and mountain slopes
Slopes: 10 to 60 percent, commonly south and west aspects
Elevation: 1,700 to 2,340 meters
Mean annual temperature: 7.0 to 9.5 degrees C
Average annual precipitation: 300 to 400 cm
Precipitation pattern: Wettest months are October to May and driest months are June to September
Frost-free period: 90 to 130 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Itca, Nevu and Pioche soils. All of these soils have argillic horizons. Itca and Pioche soils are shallow to bedrock and have greater than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Itca soils usually occur at higher elevations on north and east aspects. Pioche soils occur on convex slopes on foothills. Nevu soils have an indurated silica and carbonate layer between 50 and 100 cm. These soils occur on fan terraces at lower elevations.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to high runoff; moderate permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is singleleaf pinyon, Utah juniper, mountain big sagebrush and Indian ricegrass with some black sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, curlleaf mountainmahogany and snowberry. These soils are correlated to Upland ecological sites in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwestern Utah. MLRA 28A. These soils are of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Iron County (Iron-Washington Area), Utah, 1997. The series name is coined.

REMARKS: The diagnostic features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon: The zone from the surface to about 18 cm. (A1, A2 horizons)
Cambic horizon: The subsoil horizon from 18 to 48 cm that has been altered by weathering without illuvial accumulation. (Bw horizon)
Lithic feature: Bedrock contact is at a depth of 48 cm (R layer).
Particle-size control section: The zone from 25 to 48 cm. (part of the Bw horizon)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
