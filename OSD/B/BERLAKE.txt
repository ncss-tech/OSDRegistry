BERLAKE SERIES

The Berlake series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, and residuum derived from sandstone.  These soils are on hills, plateaus, and alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

The Assinniboine, Beavwan, Crittenden, Eapa, Emlin, Evanot, Evanston, Joplin, Kevin, Morval, Notter, Nuley, Reicess, Sugakool, Telstad, Varney, and Villa Grove soils all have continuous subhorizons of secondary calcium carbonate above 40 inches.  Cheesman, Marmarth, and Udecide soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Duffson soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Bostwick and Jarre soils have less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand in the Bt horizons.  Turret soils have loamy-skeletal C horizons or substrata at depths of 20 to 50 inches. Kenilworth soils have lithologic discontinuities at depths of 10 to 26 inches.  Perrypark and Peyton soils have moisture control sections that are moist in some parts for 15 consecutive days in the period after July 1 and are usually dry in all parts of the moisture control section during the period August 15 to the winter solstice when the soil temperature at 20 inches is greater than 41 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Berlake soils.
Parent material:  residuum, alluvium, and colluvium derived from sandstone.
Landform:  hills, plateaus, and alluvial fans.
Slopes:  1 to 25 percent.
Elevation:  6,200 to 8,200 feet.
Mean annual precipitation:  12 to 16 inches.
Mean annual temperature:  42 to 45 degrees F.
Frost-free period:  75 to 95 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Maysprings and Ironsprings soils.  Maysprings soils lack a mollic epipedon and Ironsprings soils are coarse-loamy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very low to medium runoff; moderate or moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and dryland wheat production.  Principal native vegetation is needleandthread, western wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, antelope bitterbrush, and big sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwest Colorado.  LRR D and E, MLRA 34, 47.  The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Moffat County (Moffat County Area), Colorado, 1991.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 14 inches.
Argillic horizon - the zone from 18 to 49 inches.
The name is coined from Timberlake Creek.  It differs in patterns of precipitation which results in marked differences in vegetation.
Aridic feature:  has a moisture control section that is dry in some part for 0.6 or more of the time.
When the new Mollisol chapter is approved, this series needs to be reclassified to an Aridic Argiustoll.
