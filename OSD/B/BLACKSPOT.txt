BLACKSPOT SERIES



The Blackspot series consists of shallow, well drained soils that

formed in mixed colluvium over calcareous quartzite residuum.

Blackspot soils are on mountainsides and have slopes of 30 to 60

percent.  Permeability is moderately.  The average annual precipitation

is about 14 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 41

degrees F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid, shallow Haplic Durixerolls

Durixerolls.



TYPICAL PEDON:  Blackspot very gravelly loam on a 45 percent slope at

an elevation of 5,500 feet in rangeland.  When described on July 16,

1983, the soil was dry throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil unless

otherwise noted.)



    A1--0 to 1 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly loam,

very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure;

soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very

fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores;

about 35 percent pebbles; slight effervescence (10 percent calcium

carbonate); mildly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary (0 to 3

inches thick)



    A2--1 to 7 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown

(10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, friable,

slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots;

common very fine and fine tubular pores; about 5 percent cobbles and 40

percent pebbles; strong effervescence (15 percent calcium carbonate);

moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 9 inches

thick)



    Bk--7 to 11 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly loam, brown

(10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure;

slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common

very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores;

about 5 percent cobbles and 45 percent pebbles; violent effervescence

(30 percent calcium carbonate); moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear

wavy boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)



    Bqk--11 to 14 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly loam,

brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky

structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly

plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few fine tubular pores; about 5

percent cobbles and 50 percent pebbles, including 10 percent duripan

fragments; violent effervescence (35 percent calcium carbonate);

strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 4 inches

thick)



    2Bqkm--14 to 19 inches; white indurated duripan, very pale brown

(10YR 7/3) moist; massive; few fine roots matted on top of duripan;

about 10 percent cobbles and 60 percent pebbles cemented in place;

violent effervescence (25 to 40 percent calcium carbonate); strongly

alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt broken boundary.  (3 to 10 inches thick)



    2R--19 inches; fractured calcareous quartzite bedrock with 2Bqkm

material in fractures.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series recognized in the same

family.  The Loza soils lack bedrock below the duripan.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Blackspot soils are on mountainsides.  Slopes

range from 30 to 60 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,700 to 6,000

feet.  The soils formed from colluvium over calcareous quartzite

residuum.  The average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, most of

which falls as snow and early spring rain.  The average annual air

temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 60 to 90

days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  The are the Elksel, Friedman,

Furshur, Peeveywell, Prudy, and Winridge soils.  Elksel soils are

clayey-skeletal in the control section.  Furshur soils have more than

35 percent clay in the control section and are 10 to 20 deep to a

duripan.  Friedman have Pachic epipedons.  Peevywell soils are

moderately deep to a duripan and have more than 35 percent clay in the

control section.  Prudy soils are deep to a duripan.  Winridge soils

are moderately deep and have more than 35 percent clay in the control

section.  Povey soils occur on the same landscape.  Elksel, Furshur,

Peevywell, and Winridge soils occur on mountain sides formed from

tertiary volcanics.  Prudy soils occur on similiar landscapes on north

and east-facing slopes.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; rapid to very rapid runoff;

and moderately rapid permeability.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for rangeland.  Vegetation is Black

sagebrush and Bluebunch wheatgrass.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Blackspot soils are inextensive in south

central Idaho.
