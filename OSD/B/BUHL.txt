BUHL SERIES

The Buhl series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loamy eolian deposits and in the underlying dense, clayey or loamy till on till plains and moraines. Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C. and mean annual precipitation is about 686 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, frigid Aquic Glossudalfs

    2Bt2-- 81 to 147 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 4/3) clay; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; firm; common faint discontinuous brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; common medium prominent yellowish red (5YR 5/6) Fe concentrations; 5 percent gravel and 1 percent cobbles; strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 25 to 89 centimeters)

    2BCd-- 147 to 203 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 4/3) clay; moderate very coarse and extremely coarse prismatic structure; very firm; few distinct reddish brown (5YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; carbonates segregated in few pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) irregular fine threads and soft masses; 5 percent gravel, 2 percent cobbles and 1 percent stones; neutral.

TYPE LOCATION: Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) 88-Northern Minnesota Glacial Lake Basins, St. Louis County (Embarrass Part), Minnesota; about 2 miles west of Aurora; located about 2,075 feet north and 1,500 feet west of southeast corner of sec. 7, T. 58 N., R. 15 W.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Near the type location, these are the Fayal, Hibbing, and McQuade soils. They form a hydrosequence with the Buhl soils
Fayal--are in drainagways or depressions and are in the Mollic Epiaqualfs subgroup
Hibbing--are on higher lying or more sloping positions on the landscape and are in the Oxyaquic Glossudalfs subgroup
McQuade--are on lower lying flats and in drainageways and are in the Aeric Glossaqualfs subgroup

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--somewhat poorly drained--these soils have perched seasonal high saturation as shallow as a depth 15 centimeters below the surface during the spring in normal years
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--1.00 to 10.00 micrometers per second (moderately high) in the loamy mantle, 0.10 to 10.00 micrometers per second (moderately low or moderately high) in the argillic horizons and 0.10 to 1.00 micrometers per second (moderately low) in the underlying dense till

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are forested. Principal trees are aspen, balsam fir, white spruce, jack pine, white pine and red pine. Some areas are used for cropland, hayland or pastureland. Native vegetation is mixed deciduous and coniferous forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Physiographic Division--Interior Plains or Laurentian Upland
Physiographic Province--Central Lowland or Superior Upland
Physiographic sections--Western Lake Section (if in the Central Lowland Province) or undefined (if in the Superior Upland Province)

REMARKS:
Particle size control section--the zone from a depth of 33 to 83 centimeters
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 147 centimeters

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 33 centimeters (A, E1 and E2 horizons);
albic horizon--the zone from 8 to 33 centimeters (E1 and E2 horizons);
glossic horizon--the zone from 33 to 46 centimeters (2B/E horizon);
argillic horizon--the zone from 33 to 147 centimeters (2B/E, 2Bt1 and 2Bt2 horizons);
densic materials--the zone from 147 to 203 centimeters (2BCd horizon).

The classification was changed from Aeric Glossaqualfs with an earlier Official Series Descrition revision dated 09/2006. The landscape position is such that the alpha,alpha-dipyridyl test is not deemed conclusive for the Aqualfs suborder.
