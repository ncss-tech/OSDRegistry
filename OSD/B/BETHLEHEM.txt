SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Distribution: Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia
Extent: Moderate 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Alexander County, North Carolina; 1988.

REMARKS: 
The July 2009 revision moves the type location from Alexander County, NC to Rutherford County, NC. This move was required due to the mesic/thermic break established in MLRA 136. Alexander County is mesic. The November 2025 revision changed the format. No data was changed.
Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--The zone from 0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches) (Ap horizon)
Argillic and kandic horizon--The zone from 18 to 61 centimeters (7 to 24 inches) has low activity clay in more than 50 percent of the horizon (Bt horizon)
Paralithic contact--Weathered bedrock at 84 centimeters (33 inches) the upper boundary of the Cr horizon).
