BARATARI SERIES


The Baratari series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately to moderately rapid permeable soils formed in sandy marine sediments.  These soils are on level to nearly level terraces of the lower Coastal Plain.  The water table is within 10 inches of the soil surface for about 1 to 6 months in most years.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, thermic Aeric Alaquods

TYPICAL PEDON:  Baratari fine sand--forested. (Colors are for moist soil.)

     A--0 to 5 inches; black (10YR 2/1) fine sand; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many fine and medium roots; many clean sand grains give a salt-and-pepper appearance; extremely acid; clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 9 inches thick)

     E--5 to 11 inches; light gray (10YR 6/1) fine sand; many medium distinct very dark gray (10YR 3/1) tongues of fine sand along root channels; weak fine granular structure; very friable; few fine and medium roots; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 17 inches thick)

     Bh--11 to 20 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 2/2) fine sand; weak medium subangular blocky parting to weak fine granular structure; friable; slightly brittle; few fine and medium roots; most sand grains have organic coatings; very strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary.  (4 to 32 inches thick)

     E'1--20 to 44 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sand; common medium distinct very dark gray (10YR 3/1) tongues; single grained; loose; few fine roots; moderately acid; gradual irregular boundary.  (0 to 24 inches thick)

     E'2--44 to 55 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sand; common medium faint light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) mottles; single grained; loose; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 23 inches thick)

     B'h--55 to 70 inches; black (10YR 2/1) fine sand; many medium distinct dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) mottles; massive; very friable; slightly brittle; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 22 inches thick)

     C/B'h--70 to 80 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sand; many medium distinct black (10YR 2/1) bodies of slightly brittle material; massive; very friable; strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Beaufort County, South Carolina; about two miles northeast of Bluffton, l.8 miles southeast of junction of South Carolina 46 with U.S. 278; 50 feet on north side of U.S. 278.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is sand or fine sand to a depth of 80 inches or more.  It is extremely acid to strongly acid to a depth of about 20 inches and very strongly acid below this depth.  The Bh horizon is within 30 inches of the surface.  Some pedons do not have a E' and B'h horizon.

The A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or neutral, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 0 or 1.  When dry, this horizon has a salt-and-pepper appearance.

The E horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or neutral, value of 5 to 8 and chroma of 0 to 2.  The E horizon of some pedons has mottles of higher chroma and vertical black or dark gray streaks.

The Bh horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or neutral, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 0 to 4.  Vertical or horizontal tongues or pockets of grayish sand are in the Bh horizon of some pedons.

The E' horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Fragments of the overlying Bh materials are in this horizon in some pedons.

The B'h horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or neutral, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 0 to 4.  Vertical or horizontal tongues or pockets of grayish sand are in the B'h horizon of some pedons.

The C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or neutral, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 0 to 4.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other known series in this family.  Similar series in other families are the Echaw, Leon, Lynn Haven, Mascotte, Olustee, Onslow, Ridgeland, Rimini, Rosedhu, Seagate, and Seewee series.  Echaw, Leon, Lynn Haven, Mascotte, Olustee, Onslow, Rimini, and Seagate soils have siliceous mineralogy.  In addition, the depth to the upper boundary of the spodic horizons in Echaw and Rimini soils is at depths of 30 inches or more.  Lynn Haven and Rosedhu soils have Ap or A horizons more than 10 inches thick with color values less than 3.5.  Mascotte, Olustee, Onslow, and Seagate soils have argillic horizons beneath the spodic horizons.  Ridgeland soils do not have distinct albic horizons. Seewee soils have a subhorizon in the E horizon with chroma of 3 or more.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Baratari soils are on level to nearly level areas on the Pamlico Terrace of the lower Coastal Plains.  Slope gradients are less than 2 percent.  The soils formed in sandy marine sediments.  The average annual temperature ranges from 66 to 70 degrees F., average annual rainfall ranges from 48 to 52 inches, and the frost free season ranges from 250 to 290 days.  Average January air temperature is about 51 degrees F., and July is about 81 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the similar Ridgeland, Rosedhu, and Seewee series and the Fripp, Kiawah, Polawana, Seabrook, Wando, and Yemassee series.  Fripp, Kiawah, Polawana, Seabrook, Wando, and Yemassee soils do not have a Bh horizon.  In addition, Kiawah soils contain dark brown concretions; Polawana soils have a surface layer 10 to 24 inches thick with color value of 2 or 3; and Yemassee soils have a Bt horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Baratari soils are poorly drained.  Surface runoff is slow.  Permeability is rapid in the A and E horizons and moderate to moderately rapid in the Bh horizons.  The water table is at depths of less than 10 inches for 1 to 6 months in most years and within depths of 60 inches most of the year.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Some areas are used for truck crops and pasture, but most are used for woodland.  Natural vegetation consists of longleaf, slash, and pond pine, water oaks, blackgum, myrtle, and a thick undergrowth of sawpalmetto, gallberry, scrub oak, and maiden cane.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Maryland and South Carolina. The series is of moderate extent.

REMARKS:  Near the type location, soil temperatures averaged 65 degrees F. during a two year study.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to 11 inches (A and E horizons).

Eluvial horizons - the zones from 5 to 11 inches and 20 to 55 inches (E, E'1 and E'2 horizons).

Spodic horizon - the zones from 11 to 20 inches and from 55 to 80 inches (Bh, B'h and C/Bh horizons).
