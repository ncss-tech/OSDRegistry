BLACKLOUP SERIES

The Blackloup series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils formed in loamy deposits over sandy and gravelly alluvium on flood plains. Permeability is rapid or very rapid below the loamy deposits. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean air annual temperature is about 49 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches.

Runoff: negligible
Permeability: rapid or very rapid

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in native grass and used as rangeland or hayland. They are too wet for cultivated crops. The native vegetation consists of big bluestem, switchgrass, indiangrass, prairie cordgrass and numerous sedges. In some areas the vegetation includes trees and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central and north central Nebraska and south central South Dakota. The series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Keya Paha County, Nebraska, 2004

REMARKS: The Blackloup series includes soils previously mapped on flood plains as the Loup series. The Loup series has been mapped extensively on the non flooded interdunes in the sandhills and lacks an irregular decrease in organic carbon above 50 inches.

Diagnostic features recognized in this pedon:
mollic epipedon: the zone from 0 to 13 inches (A1, A2 and AC horizons)
fluvaquentic subgroup criteria: an irregular decrease in organic carbon in the 11 to 49 inch zone (AC, Cg 2Ab, 3Cg horizons)
aquic conditions: the zone from 11 to 80 inches (AC, Cg, 2Ab, 3Cg horizons)
