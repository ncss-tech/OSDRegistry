BAYERTON SERIES

The Bayerton series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone. Bayerton soils are on ridge crest and mountain sideslopes and have slopes of 5 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bayerton fine sandy loam, forested. (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    O1--3 to 1 inch; organic material consisting mainly of needles, twigs, and bark.

    O2--1 inch to 0; partially decomposed organic material like that of the horizon above.

    A1--0 to 2 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine crumb structure; soft, very friable; 5 percent sandstone fragments less than 10 inches in diameter; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 2 inches thick)

    A2--2 to 7 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/3) moist; moderate thin platy structure that parts to moderate fine granules; slightly hard, very friable; vesicular; 5 percent fine sandstone fragments; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual wavy boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick)

    A&B--7 to 11 inches; mixed colors including light brown (7.5YR 6/3) and brown (7.5YR 5/3) sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/3) and dark brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, sticky and slightly plastic; few thin shiny patches on the faces of the more clayey aggregates; 5 percent sandstone fragments; this horizon consists of material like the overlying horizon in which are imbedded nodules and fragments of material like the underlying horizon; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual wavy boundary. (4 to 6 inches thick)

    B2t--11 to 20 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) sandy clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, sticky and plastic; thin, nearly continuous wax-like coatings on faces of peds; 5 percent sandstone fragments; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt boundary. (7 to 17 inches thick)

    B3ca--20 to 24 inches; light gray (10YR 7/1) sandy clay loam, gray (10YR 6/1) moist; weak subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; sticky and slightly plastic; few thin wax-like patches on faces of peds; 5 percent sandstone fragments; moderate accumulation on secondary calcium carbonate as soft masses and thin seams and streaks; calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick)

    R--24 inches; hard sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION:  Johnson County, Wyoming; SW1/4 sec. 30, T.45N., R.83W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to calcareous material ranges from 15 to 36 inches. Thickness of solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Organic carbon ranges from .8 to 2 percent in the surface horizons and decreases uniformly with increasing depth. Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 degrees to 46 degrees F. and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 64 degrees F.

The A2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It usually has platy structure but has granular structure in some pedons. This horizon is soft or slightly hard, and neutral or mildly alkaline.

The B2t horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is typically sandy clay loam but clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent, silt from 5 to 30 percent, and sand from 45 to 70 percent, with more than 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline. The B3ca horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR. It has 4 to 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Allens Park, Fairport, Gateson, Haugan, Nebish, Plome, and Rule series. Allens Park soils are noncalcareous throughout and contain a large amount of medium and coarse angular granitic sand. Fairport soils have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR in the B2t horizon. Gateson soils have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches, are noncalcareous, and have less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand. Haugan, Nebish, and Plome lack a lithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches. Rule soils have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches, are noncalcareous throughout, and have hue of 5YR or redder.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Bayerton soils are on bridge crests and mountain sideslopes. Slope gradients range from 5 to 50 percent.  Elevation is 6,000 to 7,500 feet. The soils formed in materials weathered from underlying sandstone. At the type location the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is about 57 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 18 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Simmont and Tolman soils. Simmont and Tolman soils lack an albic horizon and have a mollic epipedon. Also, Tolman soils have a lithic contact at depths of less than 20 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used as native pastureland, recreation, and limited forestry purposes. Principal native vegetation is juniper, scattered ponderosa pine, and an understory of grasses and sedges.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mountainous areas of north-central Wyoming.  The series is of moderate extent.
