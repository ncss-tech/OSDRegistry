BAYERTON SERIES

The Bayerton series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone. Bayerton soils are on ridge crest and mountain sideslopes and have slopes of 5 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bayerton fine sandy loam, forested. (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 5 cm; organic material consisting mainly of needles, twigs, and bark.

    Oe--5 to 8 cm; partially decomposed organic material like that of the horizon above.

    A--8 to 13 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine crumb structure; soft, very friable; 5 percent sandstone fragments less than 10 inches in diameter; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 5 cm thick)

    E--13 to 23 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/3) moist; moderate thin platy structure that parts to moderate fine granules; slightly hard, very friable; vesicular; 5 percent fine sandstone fragments; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 20 cm thick)

    E/Bt--23 to 33 cm; mixed colors including light brown (7.5YR 6/3) and brown (7.5YR 5/3) sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/3) and brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, sticky and slightly plastic; few thin shiny patches on the faces of the more clayey aggregates; 5 percent sandstone fragments; this horizon consists of material like the overlying horizon in which are imbedded nodules and fragments of material like the underlying horizon; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 15 cm thick)

    Bt--33 to 56 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/3) sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, sticky and plastic; thin, nearly continuous wax-like coatings on faces of peds; 5 percent sandstone fragments; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt boundary. (18 to 40 cm thick)

    Bk--56 to 66 cm; light gray (10YR 7/1) sandy clay loam, gray (10YR 6/1) moist; weak subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; sticky and slightly plastic; few thin wax-like patches on faces of peds; 5 percent sandstone fragments; moderate accumulation on secondary calcium carbonate as soft masses and thin seams and streaks; calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (8 to 15 cm thick)

    R--66 cm; hard sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION:  Johnson County, Wyoming; SW1/4 sec. 30, T.45N., R.83W.

E horizon
Hue--10YR or 7.5YR
Value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist
Chroma--2 through 4
Reaction--pH 6.6-7.8
Structure--usually platy,but has granular structure in some pedons

Bt horizon
Hue--10YR or 7.5YR
Value--5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma--2 through 4

Clay content--18 to 35 percent
Silt content--5 to 30 percent

Reaction--pH 6.6-7.8

Bk horizon

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Allens Park, Fairport, Gateson, Haugan, Nebish, Plome, and Rule series. Allens Park soils are noncalcareous throughout and contain a large amount of medium and coarse angular granitic sand. Fairport soils have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR in the Bt horizon. Gateson soils have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 100 cm, are noncalcareous, and have less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand. Haugan, Nebish, and Plome lack a lithic contact at depths of less than 100 cm. Rule soils have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 100 cm, are noncalcareous throughout, and have hue of 5YR or redder.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform--ridge crests and mountain sideslopes
Elevation--1825 to 2300 meters
Slope--5 to 50 percent
Parent material--materials weathered from underlying sandstone
Mean annual precipitation--460 mm with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer
Mean annual air temperature--about 7 degrees C; mean annual summer temperature is about 14 degrees C

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; rapid runoff; moderate permeability

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used as native pastureland, recreation, and limited forestry purposes. Principal native vegetation is juniper, scattered ponderosa pine, and an understory of grasses and sedges.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Bayerton soils are of small extent in the mountainous areas of north-central Wyoming and south-central Colorado; MLRAs 43B, 49
