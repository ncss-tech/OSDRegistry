BOULDERFAN SERIES

The Boulderfan series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial till and glacial debris, volcanic ash, alluvium and colluvium derived from andesite and andesitic tuff. Boulderfan soils are on ground moraines and mountain valleys. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TYPE LOCATION: Modoc County, California; on the Modoc National Forest just south of the Patterson Guard Station road and about a mile north of Camp One Spring; about 500 feet north and 600 feet west of the southeast corner of Section 3, T. 38 N., R. 16 E.; USGS Emerson Peak 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; 41 degrees 11 minutes 11.5 seconds north latitude and 120 degrees 08 minutes 10.3 seconds west longitude, NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture -- Usually moist, moist in winter and spring, dry in late summer and fall; completely dry for at least 45 consecutive days between July and October; xeric moisture regime. Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 3.5 and 5 feet (common deep free water duration and depth class) from January through May.

Mean annual soil temperature - 41 to 46 degrees F.
Mean summer soil temperature - 54 to 59 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ashflat (T, CA) Cowbell (T, CA), Fendersflat, Paynepeak, Pyropatti, Snag and Tusune series. Ashflat, Cowbell, Fendersflat, Paynepeak, Snag, and Tusune lack a water table within the profile. Pyropatti soils have a mollic epipedon 30 to 60 inches thick. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Boulderfan soils are on ground moraines and mountain valleys. They formed in glacial till and glacial debris, volcanic ash, alluvium and colluvium derived from andesite and andesitic tuff.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 6,680 to 8,000 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 25 inches, mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 60 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Lyonman, Tourn, and Waca soils. Lyonman and Tourn soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts. soils are ashy-skeletal and are moderately deep to paralithic contacts. Waca soils are medial-skeletal and moderately deep to paralithic contacts.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low or medium runoff; moderate permeability; moderately high or high saturated hydraulic conductivity class.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used to provide livestock grazing and wildlife habitat, and for watershed purposes. The vegetation is dominated by mountain silver sagebrush, western needlegrass and bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mountainous areas of northeastern California in the Warner Mountains. They are not extensive. MLRA 21.
