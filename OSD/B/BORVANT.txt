BORVANT SERIES

The Borvant series consists of shallow to a petrocalcic horizon, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium derived from limestone, sandstone and igneous rock. Borvant soils are on fan remnants, hills, and ridges on mountains. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 350 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, mesic, shallow Petrocalcic Palexerolls

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Borvant soils are on fan remnants, hills, and ridges on mountains. They formed in alluvium or colluvium derived from limestone and sandstone and igneous rock. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent. Elevations range from 1,400 to 2,450 m. The climate is dry subhumid. The mean annual temperature is 7 to 11.5 degrees C. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm. The freeze-free period is 90 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Amtoft, Atepic, Fontreen, Lizzant and Lodar soils. None of these soils have petrocalcic horizons. Also, Amtoft and Atepic soils do not have mollic epipedons; Lodar and Amtoft soils have lithic contacts at depths of 50 cm or less.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium to very high surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for rangeland. The present vegetation is Utah juniper, pinyon, black sagebrush, cliffrose, Indian ricegrass, rabbitbrush, and slender wheatgrass.  These soils are correlated to Upland ecological sites in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West-central Utah and eastern Nevada. These soils are extensive. MLRAs 28A and 47.
