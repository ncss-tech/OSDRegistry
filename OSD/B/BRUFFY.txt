BRUFFY SERIES

The Bruffy series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Bruffy soils are on slough channels and floodplains. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid Xeric Torrifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bruffy silt loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(10 to 25 cm thick)

    2Ck--58 to 71 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly sandy clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 15 percent hard durinodes; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 25 cm thick)

    3Ck--71 to 89 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine interstitial and tubular pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 30 cm thick)

    4C--89 to 152 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grained; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine interstitial pores; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bruffy soils are in slough channels and floodplains Elevations are 1,750 to 2,020 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The soils formed in moderately fine textured alluvium derived from mixed parent rocks.  The climate is cool, semiarid continental with an average annual precipitation of about 200 to 250 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C.  The growing season is about 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Shipley and Kobeh soils.  Shipley soils have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections.  Kobeh soils have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderately slow permeability; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and irrigated cropland.  Principal crops are small grains and alfalfa.  The principal vegetation is big sagebrush, annuals, shadscale, and black greasewood.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  High elevation valleys in central and northeastern Nevada.  The series is inextensive. MLRA 28B
