BELLCANYON SERIES

The Bellcanyon series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium derived from limestone.  These soils occur on stream terraces, alluvial fans, fan remnants, hills and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 1 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 483 mm and mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, carbonatic Ustic Calcicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Bellcanyon gravelly loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

   A--0 to 13 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and non-plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; many fine and very fine dendritic tubular pores; 20 percent gravel; disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 38 cm thick)

   Bk1--13 to 28 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slighty hard, friable, slighty sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; 20 percent gravel; 5 percent soft masses of calcium carbonate; continuous distinct calcium carbonate crusts on underside of fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 50 cm thick)

   Bk2--28 to 58 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slighty hard, friable, slightly sticky and non-plastic; few very fine and fine roots; 20 percent gravel; 25 percent soft masses of calcium carbonate; continuous distinct calcium carbonate crusts on underside of fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.

   Bk3--58 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) gravelly loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and non-plastic; 20 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; disseminated calcium carbonate; continuous distinct calcium carbonate coats on fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).
