COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: ash influence loess over coarse ablation till 
Landform: kame and lateral moraines 
Slope: 0 to 60 percent
Mean annual temperature: about 35 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: about 35 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Estelle and Nikolaevsk soils. Estelle soils have a spodic horizon and a loamy-skeletal material in the particle size control section. Nikolaevsk soils have a spodic horizon and an aquic moisture conditions within 20 inches (50 cm) of the mineral soil surface.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, very low to high runoff, saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the solum and high to very high in the underlying glacial till.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for timber production and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is Lutz spruce below timberline and mixed shrubs, forbs, and grasses above timberline.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 224 Cook Inlet Lowlands, South-central Alaska. The series is of moderate extent.
