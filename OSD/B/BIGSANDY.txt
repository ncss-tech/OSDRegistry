BIGSANDY SERIES 

The Bigsandy series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: 

Hagga (CO) - have a seasonal high water table at depths of 0 to 12 inches; buried A horizons; elevation over 5,800 feet. 

Mckeen (ND) - is very poorly drained with a seasonal high water table at 0 to 12 inches.  In addition, Mckeen soils have an EC of less than 4 mmhos/cm throughout. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 

Landform - flood plains adjacent to perennial streams. 

Elevation - 2,200 to 5,500 feet. 

Slopes - 0 to 4 percent. 

Parent material - alluvium derived from mixed sources including igneous and sedimentary rocks and glacial till. 

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers. 

Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 19 inches. 

Mean annual air temperature - 41 to 45 degrees F. 

Frost-free period - 70 to 135 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Glendive, Hanly and Havre soils.  These soils are above the Bigsandy soils on the landscape.  They do not have an aquic moisture regime.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; moderate or moderately slow permeability in the upper 32 inches of the profile and moderately slow or slow permeability below. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Bigsandy soils are used mainly for range and native grass hay production.  Potential native vegetation is mainly basin wildrye, tufted hairgrass, northern reedgrass, prairie cordgrass, slender wheatgrass, Canada wildrye, sedges, rushes, willows, and rose. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Bigsandy soils are of small extent in north-central Montana. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Toole County, Montana, 1991. Series name is from the town of Big Sandy. 

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1078. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 7 inches (A and C horizons); redox features below a depth of 11 inches (Cg1 and Cg2 horizons); particle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches (C, Cg1, and Cg2 horizons).  Bigsandy soils have a frigid temperature regime and an aquic moisture regime.
