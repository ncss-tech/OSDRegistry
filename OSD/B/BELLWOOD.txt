BELLWOOD SERIES

The Bellwood series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in acid, clayey Tertiary age sediments. These nearly level to steep soils occur on  Coastal Plain uplands. Mean annual precipitation is about 1403 mm (55.23 in)and the mean annual temperature is about 19 degrees C (65.5 degrees F). Slopes are 1 to 20 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Very-fine, smectitic, thermic Aquic Dystruderts

TYPICAL PEDON: Bellwood clay on a 4 percent slope in a micro low position in pine woodland at an elevation of 61.3 m (203 ft). (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 3 (0 to 1 in); reddish brown (5YR 4/3) silty clay loam; weak fine granular structure; friable; many fine roots; very strongly acid; abrupt irregular boundary. (Thickness of the A horizon is 0 to 8 cm [0 to 3 in])

    Bw--3 to 18 cm (1 to 7 in); yellowish red (5YR 4/6) clay; moderate, medium subangular blocky structure; firm; many fine and medium roots; continuous shiny pressure faces on surfaces of peds; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. (Thickness of the Bw horizon is 10 to 38 cm [4 to 15 in])

(Combined thickness of the BCss horizons is 25 to 56 cm [10 to 22 in])

    BCss2--140 to 152 cm (55 to 60 in); pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay; common fine faint yellowish brown mottles; weak coarse angular blocky structure; weak coarse angular blocky structure; very firm; shiny pressure faces and few slickensides on surfaces of most peds; very strongly acid.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The gilgai relief consist of microknolls and microdepressions with a relief of 5 to 20 cm (2 to 8 in) and distances of 2,4 to 4.6 m (8 to 15 ft) between centers of knolls and depressions. Depth to intersecting slickensides ranges from 18 to 53 cm (7 to 21 in). Solum thickness ranges from 127 to 203 cm (50 to 80 in) or more. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid throughout the solum.  It is extremely acid or very strongly acid in more than half the thickness of the upper 51 cm (20 in). Base saturation ranges from 10 to 30 percent throughout the B and BC horizons.

COMPETING SERIES: There are the Bayoudan(LA) and Vaiden(AL) series in the same family, and the Brooksville(MS), Burkville(IL), Lacerda(TX), Lebeau(LA), Louin(MS), Morse(LA), Naclina(TX), Redco(TX), Tahoula(TX), Terouge(AR), Vamont(TX), and Zilaboy(TX) series in related families. Bayoudan soils are moderately well drained and have gypsum crystals in the lower part of the solum. 
Vaiden soils have an argillic horizon and formed over weathered chalk or calcareous clay.  
Burkville and Redco soils have a yellower hue in the upper part of the control section and do not have aquic conditions in the upper 40 inches of the solum. 
Lacerda soils do not have red mottles within a depth of 20 inches. 
Lebeau soils are slightly acid to moderately alkaline throughout the solum. 
Brooksville, Terouge, and Zilaboy soils have lower value colors in the upper part of the solum. 
Morse and Tahoula soils have a less acid control section and are better drained. 
Louin, Naclina, and Vamont soils have 35 to 60 percent clay in the control sections.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent Material: acid clayey Tertiary age sediments
Landscape: uplands
Landform: coastal plains
Slope: 1 to 20 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 1184 to 1611 mm (46.5 to 63.5 in)
Mean annual air temperature: 13 to 25 degrees C (55 to 77 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 228 to 289 days
Elevation: 36.0 to 85 m (118 to 280 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Keithville(LA), Natchitoches(LA), and Sacul(AR) series. 
Keithville and Sacul soils have less than 60 percent clay in the control sections, do not have vertic properties, and are on slightly higher elevations. 
Natchitoches soils have glauconitic sand in the B horizons and are on higher elevations.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Bellwood soils are somewhat poorly drained; runoff is medium to high; permeability is very slow. They have an apparent water table at depths of 2 to 4 feet below the surface during winter and early spring.

USE AND VEGETATION: The major use is timber production. The plant community is loblolly pine, short leaf pine and mixed hardwoods. A few small areas are cleared for pasture. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coastal plains of Louisiana and possibly Mississippi, Arkansas, and east Texas.
Extent: Moderate
