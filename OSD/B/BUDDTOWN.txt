MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES PROPOSED: Burlington County, New Jersey, 1999

REMARKS: Buddtown soils were previously mapped in New Jersey as Nixonton soils. Nixonton soils are in a thermic temperature regime and are fine-silty. Particle-size data from several pedons within 3 counties in New Jersey supports a coarse-loamy family. Buddtown soils occur adjacent to landforms and soils with higher glauconite content, and typically contain few glauconite pellets mixed with the dominantly reworked marine materials from which the soils formed. Unconforming materials and the presence of a lithological discontinuity (2C horizon) are not a series requirement. Pedons that do not have unconforming 2C materials are not significantly different in use and management.

Diagnostic horizons and other soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 9 inches (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 9 to 34 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)
Aquic conditions--the zone from 26 to 80 inches is periodically saturated (endosaturation)

Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Lithologic discontinuity--Contrasting sand sizes at depth of 34 inches (2C1, 2C2, 2C3, and 2C4 horizons)
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Reference particle-size data is available from the project soil survey staff, Hammonton, New Jersey.
