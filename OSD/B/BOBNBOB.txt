BOBNBOB SERIES

The Bobnbob series consist of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  They are on flood plains.  Mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches, mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, thermic Aquic Torrifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bobnbob silty clay loam, rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A2--3 to 7 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, sticky and plastic; many fine and common medium roots; common fine tubular pores; few faint clay films in root channels; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline; (pH 8.8) clear wavy boundary.   (3 to 5 inches thick)

    3Ckqb--52 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine interstitial pores; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) mottles; common medium and fine very pale brown (10YR 8/2) lime masses; weakly lime cemented; 5 percent durinodes; matrix effervescent, lime masses violently effervescent; strongly alkaline; (pH 8.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  Nye County, Nevada; about 700 feet west and 400 feet north of the southeast corner of section 12 T. 2 N. R. 43 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Usually dry, intermittently moist in winter and spring, dry in summer and fall. Typic Aridic soil moisture regime. The ratio of soil moisture utalized for evapotranspiration between summer and winter is about 0.4:1, typical of the Mojave Desert. (Saturated at depths of 3 to 5 feet in late winter and spring, unless drained.)

Soil temperature - 59 to 65 degrees F.

Depth to saturated conditions - 36 to 40 inches

Reaction: Strongly or very strongly alkaline


Control section - Clay content:  27 to 35 percent.


A horizon - Value:  6 through 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist.

Chroma:  2 or 3.


C horizon - Hue:  10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y.

Value:  6 through 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist.

Chroma:  2 or 3.

Texture:  Stratified fine sandy loam to clay, averages silty clay loam.

Carbonates:  20 to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.


2Ab horizon (when present)- Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist.

Chroma:  2 or 3.

Texture:  Silt loam, loam or silty clay loam.


3Ckq - Hue:  10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y.

Value:  7 or 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist.

Carbonate:  40 to 60 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series at this time. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bobnbob soils are on flood plains along the basin floor.  They formed in mixed alluvium with a large amount of limestone.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 2000 to 2500.  The climate is typical of the Mojave Desert with hot, dry summers and mild winters. The mean annual temperature is 59 to 63 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 4 to 8 inches and the frost-free season is 200 to 250 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Caslo and Cobatus soils.  Caslo soils are carbonatic and Cobatus soils have fine-loamy control sections.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; runoff is slow; permeability is slow.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland.  The present vegetation is mostly saltgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwest Nevada.  Small extent, MLRA 30.
