BACON SERIES

The Bacon series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in alluvium.  Bacon soils are found on slopes of 0 to 10 percent on floodplains, valley bottoms and terraces of glaciated mountain landscapes.  The mean annual precipitation is about 2,100 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, isotic, acid Typic Cryaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Bacon fine sandy loam, located on a non-forested northeast facing debris apron with a slope of less than 2 percent and an elevation of 1,400 meters.  When described on September 11, 2006 the soil was wet throughout.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted)

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bacon soils are found on slopes of 0 to 10 percent on floodplains and terraces of glaciated mountain landscapes at elevations from 600 to 2,000 meters and formed in alluvium.  The climate is characterized by cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1,750 to 2,800 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 3 to 6 degrees C.  Frost-free season is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Beaverpass, Forbidden, Purple, and Yawning soils.  Beaverpass soils have organic soil materials to a depth of 91 cm, the Forbidden and Yawning soils have ochric epipedons, and the Purple soils have a histic epipedon.  Forbidden and Beaverpass soils have a sandy-skeletal particle size control section, Yawning soils have a loamy-skeletal particle size control section.  Forbidden and Yawning soils have andic soil properties within the upper 25 cm.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Very poorly drained; high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Bacon soils have a water table from endosaturation with an upper limit at the soil surface from November through May and down to 25 cm from June through October.  Bacon soils are subject to frequent ponding for very long durations from December through April and for brief durations in May, June, October, and November.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Bacon soils support wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed. Natural vegetation includes Pacific silver fir, mountain hemlock, Engelmann spruce, and subalpine fir.  Understory species include red alder, Sitka willow, redosier dogwood, prickly currant, salmonberry, field horsetail, sedges, and grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North Cascade Mountains, Washington.  MLRA 3.  Series is of small extent.
