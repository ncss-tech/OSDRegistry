BRINNUM SERIES

The Brinnum series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in silty over sandy alluvium derived from mixed rocks. These soils are on lake plains and basin floor remnants. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Typic Halaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Brinnum silt loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.

    A1--0 to 8 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) silt loam, light gray (10YR 7/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few medium, and common fine and very fine roots; few medium, common fine, and many very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 cm thick)

    A2--8 to 15 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) silt loam, light gray (10YR 7/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few medium, and common fine and very fine roots; few medium, common fine, and many very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.6); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 10 cm thick)

    Bg--15 to 56 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) silt loam, light gray (10YR 7/2) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few medium, fine, and very fine roots; common fine, and many very fine tubular pores; common fine faint very pale brown (10YR 8/3) and very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist redox concentrations; gray (N/5) redox depletions, dark gray (N/4) moist, lining pores and root channels; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary.  (36 to 46 cm thick)

    Cg--56 to 104 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) silty clay loam, light gray (10YR 7/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few medium, fine, and very fine roots; common fine, and many very fine tubular pores; common fine faint very pale brown (10YR 8/3) and very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist redox concentrations; gray (N/5) redox depletions, dark gray (N/4) moist, lining pores and root channels; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (25 to 64 cm thick)

    2C--104 to 152 cm; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) gravelly loamy sand, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) moist; single grain; loose; many fine and very fine interstitial pores; 20 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2) not extensive.

TYPE LOCATION: Eureka County, Nevada; approximately 30 miles west of Eureka in Bean Flat; about 1,500 feet east and 2,200 feet south of the northwest corner of section 33, T. 20 N., R. 49 E.; USGS Bean Flat East 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees, 34 minutes 5.7 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 27 minutes 56.3 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.5682500 latitude, -116.4656389 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Dry in midsummer to early fall, moist in late fall through early summer.  A seasonal water table is at depths of 15 to 45 cm in winter to early summer months.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 10 degrees C.
Depth to unconformable 2C: 100 to over 150 cm.
Other features: Exchangeable sodium percent in the upper part of the profile ranges from 15 to 40 and decreases with depth.
Reaction; Moderately alkaline through very strongly alkaline, decreasing with depth.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 18 to 35 percent.

A horizon
Value: 6 through 8 dry, 3 to 7 moist.

C horizon
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 4 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist
Texture: Stratified silt loam and silty clay loam.
Clay: 18 to 35 percent.

2C horizon
Rock fragments: 15 to 35 percent, fine gravel.
Texture: Stratified gravelly sandy loam, gravelly loamy sand and gravelly sand.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Saltillo and Saltine series.

Saltillo soils are in a higher precipitation zone and are not underlain by sand and gravels.  Saltine soils are in a higher precipitation zone, have Bw horizons and are not underlain by sand and gravels.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Brinnum soils are on lake plains and basin floor remnants.  These soils formed in silty over sandy alluvium derived from loess and mixed rock sources. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations are 1,830 to 1,920 meters. The climate is cool semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 175 to 230 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 90 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Beanflat, Bubus, and Dianev soils. Beanflat soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section and a frigid temperature regime. Bubus soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section and silica cementation. Dianev soils have an exchangeable sodium percentage less than 15 and a fine-loamy particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained; flooded March through May; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly alkali sacaton, alkali cordgrass, rush, sedge, tapertip hawksbeard, and dock.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28B.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the surface to 18 cm (A1, A2 and part of the Bg horizons).
Cambic horizon - The zone from 15 to 56 cm; with an aquic condition, 2 chroma and redoximorphic concentrations (Bg horizon).
Exchangeable sodium greater than 15 within 50 cm and decreasing with depth.
Particle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (part of the Bq and Cq horizons).

The classification is based on the "Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006".
