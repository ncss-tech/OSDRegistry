BARGAMIN SERIES

The Bargamin series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in a deep volcanic ash mantle over loess and highly weathered basalt. They are on hills on basalt plateaus. Permeability is slow and slopes range from 10 to 35 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 37 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Berray, Bussel, Odonnell, Revling (T) and Tomodo (T) series. Berray soils have lamellae and less than 18 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Bussel soils have more than 30 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Odonnel soils are moderately well drained. Revling soils have mica flakes in the control section and do not have moist hue of 5YR or redder in the 3Btb. Tomodo soils have fragic properties in the subsoil.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bargamin soils are on hills at elevations of 2,200 to 3,400 feet with slopes of 10 to 35 percent. These soils formed in a deep volcanic ash mantle over loess and highly weathered basalt. The average annual temperature is 41 to 44 degrees F. and the average precipitation is 30 to 40 inches. The frost free season is 50 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dowper (T), Grangemont (T), Jaype (T), Placer (T) and the competing Revling (T) soils. All soils are on hills. Grangemont, Jaype and Placer soils have less than 14 inches of volcanic ash on the surface.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, watershed, and recreation.  Potential natural vegetation is western redcedar, grand fir, Douglas-fir, western larch, western white pine and lodgepole pine with an understory of queencup beadlily, longtube twinflower, coolwort foamflower, American trailplant, common beargrass, big blueberry, bunchberry dogwood, goldthread and, starry false Solomons-seal.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North central Idaho.  Bargamin soils are not extensive.
