BESSLEN SERIES

The Besslen series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that are located on basalt buttes.  They developed in loess and silty alluvium.  Slopes range from 1 to 4 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Xeric Haplodurids

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Arritola (T), Chiara, Coltroop, Crooked, Frohman, Minveno, Nevoyer, Otoole, Peeko, Plegomir, Scoon, Tenvorrd, and Yahoo (T). Arritola soils are non-calcareous above the duripan.  Chiara soils are non-calcareous above 7 inches and have a C horizon that has 20 to 60 percent brittle durinodes.  Coltroop soils have less than 5 percent rock fragments and no duripan fragments in the control section. Crooked soils have more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser and are saline-alkaline.  Frohman soils have a thin, rippable duripan and bedrock is deeper than 40 inches.  Minveno soils have less than 15 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section.  Nevoyer soils have bedrock above 20 inches. Otoole soils are somewhat poorly drained and are strongly or very strongly alkaline. Peeko soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Plegomir, Scoon, Tenvorrd and Yahoo soils are greater than 40 inches deep to bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Besslen soils are on ridges and sideslopes on basalt plains and buttes.  These soils formed in loess and silty alluvium.  Slopes are 1 to 4 percent.  Elevations range from 4,000 to 4,500 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.  The average annual temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F. and the frost free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Minveno soil and the Bruncan, Elijah, Hoosegow, Power, and Snowmore.  Bruncan soils have and argillic horizon.  Elijah and Snowmore soils have argillic horizons and are moderately deep to a thick duripan.  Hoosegow and Power soils are very deep, lack a duripan, and have argillic horizons.  These soils occupy landscapes similar to those of the Besslen soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; runoff is slow to medium; permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Besslen soils are used for rangeland and irrigated cropland. Vegetation in the potential natural plant community includes: Sandberg bluegrass, Thurber needlegrass and Wyoming big sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Besslen soils are of small extent in south central Idaho.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lincoln County, Idaho, 1993.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - zone from 0 to 2 inches (A horizon)

Calcic horizon - zone from 2 to 19 inches (Bkq1, Bkq2, Bkq3, and 2Bkq horizons)

Duripan - zone from 19 to 38 inches (2Bkqm horizon)

Classification of this pedon has been revised as of 4/00 from loamy, mixed, mesic Xerollic Durorthids to loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Xeric Haplodurids based on revisions to Soil Taxonomy.
