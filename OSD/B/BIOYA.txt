BIOYA SERIES

The Bioya series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in loess over alluvium derived from basalt and other volcanic rocks. They are on fan piedmont remnants and plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Haplodurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bioya very fine sandy loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 18 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate very thin platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots, few medium roots; many fine vesicular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.   (8 to 18 cm thick)

    A2--18 to 28 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate very thin platy structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lander County, Nevada, about 18 miles north of Battle Mountain, approximately 1,200 feet north and 750 feet east of the southwest corner of section 35, T. 35 N., R. 46 E.; USGS Izzenhood Spring 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 51 minutes 42 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 45 minutes 59 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.8616667 latitude, -116.7663889 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in winter and spring, dry from mid-June to November; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C.
Depth to Bqk horizon: 20 to 42 cm.
Depth to indurated duripan: 50 to 100 cm.
Other features: Some pedons have a thin Bw horizons above 10 cm.  Some pedons have a Bq horizon that lack carbonates and have value of 6 through 8 dry.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 18 to 27 percent.

A horizon 
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist. (More than 5.5 dry and 3.5 moist when the surface 18 cm are mixed.)
Chroma:  2 through 4.
Reaction:  Slightly alkaline through moderately alkaline.

Bqk horizon 
Value:  6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist.
Chroma:  3 through 6.
Texture:  Silt loam, or loam.
Structure:  Subangular blocky or horizon is massive.
Reaction:  slightly alkaline through very strongly alkaline.
Other features:  20 to 50 percent durinodes or is discontinuously weakly silica cemented.

2Bqkm horizon
Structure:  Thick or very thick platy, or is massive.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Brabble and Vickery series.  

Brabble and Vickery soils have cambic horizons.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bioya soils are on summits and side slopes of fan piedmont remnants and plateaus.  Elevations are 1,230 to 1,830 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in loess over alluvium from basalt and other volcanic rocks.  The climate is cool semi-arid.  The mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C, mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Snapper soils.  Snapper soils have a clay Bt horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow or medium runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is mainly Indian ricegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, and Wyoming big sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern and east-central Nevada.  MLRA 28B, 25.  The soils are of small extent.
