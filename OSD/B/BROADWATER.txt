BROADWATER SERIES

The Broadwater series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils formed in stratified sandy and gravelly alluvium on valley flood plains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches at the type location, and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Aridic Ustifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Broadwater loamy sand, with a slope of 1 percent, on a channeled flood plain, in rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  A--0 to 3 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; 3 percent gravel by volume, strong effervescence; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 7 inches thick)

  C1--3 to 9 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain, soft, very friable; thin strata of loamy very fine sand; 3 percent gravel by volume; strong effervescence, slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 26 inches thick)

  2C2--9 to 32 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly coarse sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; loose; thin strata of loamy very fine sand; 18 percent gravel by volume; strong effervescence; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.

  2C3--32 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) gravelly coarse sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; single grain; loose; thin strata of coarse sand; 31 percent gravel by volume; strong effervescence, slightly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Garden County, Nebraska; about 3.5 miles south and .5 miles west of Oshkosh, Nebraska; 1600 feet south and 900 feet west of the northeast corner of section 21, T. 16 N., R. 44 W. Barn Butte topographic quadrangle; latitude 41 degrees, 20 minutes, 50 seconds North and Longitude 102 degrees, 21 minutes, 45 seconds West.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Garden County, Nebraska 1994.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 3 inches (A horizon) 
fluventic properties: thin strata of loamy very fine sand, 3 to 32 inches in depth (C1 and C2 horizons)

This soil was previously mapped with the Bankard series.  It contains more gravel throughout the series control section than the Bankard series.
