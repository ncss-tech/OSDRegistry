BONA SERIES

The Bona series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in gravelly colluvium and the underlying residuum from cherty dolomite or limestone bedrock.  These soils are on ridgetops and side slopes in upland prairie areas.  Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, mixed, semiactive, mesic Typic Paleudolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bona gravelly silt loam on a north-facing, convex, 5 percent slope in pasture at an elevation of 1,080 feet.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Ap--0 to 6 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) gravelly silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak medium granular structure; friable; many fine roots; 25 percent subrounded chert gravel; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary.

    A--6 to 18 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) very gravelly silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; moderate medium granular structure; friable; many fine roots; 55 percent subrounded chert gravel; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Ap and A horizons ranges from 10 to 20 inches.)

    3Bt5--62 to 72 inches; yellowish red (5YR 4/6) clay; many medium distinct red (2.5YR 4/6) diagonal streaks; moderate fine angular blocky structure; firm few fine roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent subrounded chert gravel and 2 percent subrounded chert cobbles; moderately acid.

    3R--72 inches; dolostone.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bona soils are on ridgetops and side slopes in upland prairie areas of the western border Ozarks region.  Slope ranges from 3 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in gravelly colluvium and the underlying residuum from cherty dolomite or limestone.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 46 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cedargap, Creldon, Goss, Hoberg, and Goodson soils.  The Cedargap soils are loamy-skeletal and are below the Bona soils immediately adjacent to narrow drainageways.  The Creldon and Hoberg soils have fragipans and are on broad upland ridges above the Bona soils.  Goss soils have an ochric epipedon and are on similar landforms.  Goodson soils have clayey particle size control sections and are on higher convex ridges.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, permeability is moderately slow and surface runoff is medium.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for pasture or hayland.  Native vegetation is tall prairie grass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Ozark Border area (MLRA 116B) of southwest Missouri. The series is of small extent.
