BUHRIG SERIES

The Buhrig series consists of moderately deep, well drained soil formed in residuum and colluvium from igneous and metasedimentary rocks with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess. These soils are on mountain ridges and knobs. Slopes are 5 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 900 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.(6 degrees C.).

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon: 
Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 9 cm (Oi and A horizons)
Cambic horizon - the zone from 9 to 29 cm (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)
Andic soil properties - the zone from 1 to 29 cm (A, Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)
Lithic contact - the zone starting at 77 cm
Particle size control section - the zone from 26 to 77 cm (part of the Bw2 and the 2C horizons) 

The 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Loamy-skeletal, isotic Andic Eutrocryepts to Loamy-skeletal, isotic Haploxerandic Haplocryepts due to revision of the Cryepts great groups and subgroups.
