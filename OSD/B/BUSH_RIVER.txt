DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Distribution: South Carolina and Georgia
Extent: Small

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Newberry County, South Carolina, 2005

REMARKS: Bush River soils were previously included in mapping with Helena soils. Helena soils have a depth to soft bedrock of greater than 152 centimeters (60 inches). The August 1991 revision of Helena changed depth to bedrock from "more than (123 to more than 152 centimeters) 48 inches to more than 60 inches" to be consistent with one depth to bedrock class as shown on the Soil Interpretation Records. The March 2009 version increases the slope to 25%-DTA.  The February 2026 revision updated the format.  No data was changed.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 25 centimeters (0 to 10 inches) (A and E horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 25 to 117 centimeters (10 to 46 inches) (Bt and BCt horizons)

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Characterization samples have been submitted to the National Soil Survey Center, Lincoln, Nebraska. (S00SC-071-004-01-07).
