SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Distribution: Thermic region of Piedmont in South Carolina and possibly Georgia
Extent: Small 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Newberry County, South Carolina, 2005 

REMARKS: Bush River soils were previously included in mapping with Helena soils. Helena soils have a depth to paralithic contact of greater than 60 inches. The March 2009 version increases the slope to 25%-DTA.
Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 10 inches (A and E horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 10 to 46 inches (Bt and BCt horizons)
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches 

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Characterization samples have been submitted to the National Soil Survey Center, Lincoln, Nebraska. (S00SC-071-004-01-07).
