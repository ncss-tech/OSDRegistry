BROWNFIELD SERIES

The Brownfield series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils derived from sandy eolian deposits from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. Brownfield soils are on nearly level to gently sloping plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 457 mm (18 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).

Poseysoils: are on similar landscape positions but have a calcic horizon at 30 to 58 cm (12 to 23 in).

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:Well drained and moderate permeability. Surface runoff is negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes and low on 1 to 5 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:Mainly used for cropland but also used as native rangeland. Principal crops grown are cotton and grain sorghum. Climax vegetation is tall and mid grasses, with tall grasses tending to dominate. This site is dominated by little and sand bluestem along with taller dropseed species. The remainder is mid and short grasses such as sideoats grama, sand dropseed, hooded windmillgrass, sand lovegrass, sand paspalum, fall witchgrass, hairy grama, needle and thread, and perennial threeawn. Sand sage, shinoak, and skunkbush are also present. This soil has been correlated to the Sandy (R077CY035TX) ecological site in MLRA-77C.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:Southern High Plains of western Texas and eastern New Mexico (sub-MLRA-77C). The series is extensive.
