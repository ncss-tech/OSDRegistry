BOOFUSS SERIES

The Boofuss series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks and lacustrine sediments.  Boofuss soils are on floodplains, alluvial flats and lake plains. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

Depth to a contrasting layer: 38 to 89 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Average 35 to 50 percent in the upper part and 8 to 15 percent in the lower part.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Boofuss soils are on alluvial flats, floodplains and lake plains.  These soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources and lacustrine sediments. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations are 1,710 to 1,890 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Duffer and Equis series.  Duffer soils have a fine-silty particle-size control section and are carbonatic. Equis soils have a fine particle-size control section and are carbonatic.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Poorly drained; slow runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly black greasewood and inland saltgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central Nevada.  These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28B.
