COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loess over glacial till
Landform: glacial moraines
Slope: 0 to 30 percent
Mean annual temperature: 25 to 28 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 14 to 16 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the BUTCHLAKE series. BUTCHLAKE series soils are well drained without permafrost on similar landforms.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained, medium to high runoff.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high above the permafrost and low to very low in the permafrost.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The native vegetation includes alder scrub with fireweed and grass understory.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 229, Interior Alaska Lowlands. The series is of moderate extent.
