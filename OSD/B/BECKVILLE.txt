BECKVILLE SERIES

The Beckville series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.6 degrees C (51 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Fluvaquentic Eutrudepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Beckville loam, on a slope of less than 1 percent in a cultivated field at an elevation of 238 meters (780 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 28 cm (11 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; friable; common fine roots; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. [18 to 28 cm (7 to 11 inches) thick]

 Bw1--28 to 53 cm (11 to 21 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) loam; weak medium granular structure; friable; common fine roots; few distinct dark brown (10YR 3/3) organic coatings on faces of peds; few fine faint grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions in the matrix; neutral; clear wavy boundary.

 Bw2--53 to 71 cm (21 to 28 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam; weak fine granular structure; friable; few fine roots; common medium faint grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions in the matrix; neutral; clear smooth boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bw horizon is 33 to 74 cm (13 to 29 inches).]

 Cg1--71 to 112 cm (28 to 44 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam; massive; friable; many medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. [0 to 51 cm (20 inches) thick]

 Cg2--112 to 152 cm (44 to 60 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy loam; massive; very friable; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; 10 percent rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Montgomery County, Indiana; about 2.5 miles north of Mace; 600 feet east and 2,350 feet south of the northwest corner of sec. 32, T. 19 N., R. 3 W.; USGS Darlington, Indiana topographic quadrangle; lat. 40 degrees 2 minutes 52.3 seconds N. and long. 86 degrees 47 minutes 17.6 seconds W., NAD 27; UTM Zone 16, 518064 easting and 4433097 northing, NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Middlebury series. Similar series that have an active cation-exchange activity class are the Oldenburg and Waterford series. Middlebury and Oldenburg soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Waterford soils have textures that average more than 80 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Beckville soils are on flood plains in areas of Wisconsin aged glaciation. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in recent loamy alluvium. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1092 mm (36 to 43 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.0 to 11.1 degrees C (50 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 175 to 190 days. Elevation is 143 to 305 meters (470 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cohoctah, Shoals, and Stonelick soils. The poorly drained and very poorly drained Cohoctah soils have a mollic epipedon and are in depressions or oxbows. The somewhat poorly drained Shoals soils have grayer subsoils and are on lower lying positions. The well drained Stonelick soils do not have redox features and are on higher lying positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. Depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 46 to 76 cm (1.5 to 2.5 feet) between December and March in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high. Permeability is moderately rapid. This soil is subject to flooding.

USE AND VEGETATION: Mostly cultivated. Corn and soybeans are the principal crops. Some of the narrow flood plains and areas dissected by overflow channels are woodland or pasture. Native vegetation is elm, hackberry, buckeye, sycamore, green ash, and white ash.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 111A and 111D in west-central Indiana. The type location is in MLRA 111D. The series is of small extent.
