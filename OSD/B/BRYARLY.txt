BRYARLY SERIES

 The Bryarly series consists of deep, moderately well drained, very
 slowly permeable soils that formed in alkaline clayey marine
 deposits.  These upland soils have slopes ranging from 1 to 8
 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, thermic Vertic Paleudalfs

 TYPICAL PEDON:  Bryarly clay loam--forested.
                 (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise
 stated.)

      A1--0 to 3 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay
 loam; moderate very fine granular structure; very hard, firm; few
 fine roots; medium acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (2 to 10 inches
 thick)

      B21t--3 to 18 inches; red (2.5YR 4/6) clay; common fine and
 medium prominent mottles of gray (10YR 6/1); moderate fine blocky
 structure; extremely hard, very firm; few fine roots; thin
 continuous clay films or pressure faces; very strongly acid;
 gradual smooth boundary.  (12 to 20 inches thick)

      B22t--18 to 46 inches; gray (10YR 6/1) clay; many fine and
 medium prominent red (2.5YR 4/6) and common fine distinct
 yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) mottles; moderate fine blocky
 structure; extremely hard, very firm; thin continuous clay films
 or pressure faces; medium acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (15 to
 30 inches thick)

      B3ca--46 to 70 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) clay; few
 fine prominent mottles of red and gray; weak subangular blocky
 structure; extremely hard, very firm; few shiny pressure faces; 5
 to 10 percent concretions and soft bodies of calcium carbonate;
 calcareous; moderately alkaline; diffuse smooth boundary.  (15 to
 26 inches thick)

      Cca--70 to 80 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) clay; few
 fine and medium distinct gray (5Y 6/1) mottles; massive; extremely
 hard, very firm; few concretions and masses of calcium carbonate;
 calcareous; moderately alkaline.

 TYPE LOCATION:  Red River County, Texas; about 3.5 miles
 south-southeast of Boxelder and 100 feet east of private road; 1.2
 miles south of Boxelder on county road; 0.5 mile east and 1.0 mile
 south on county road; 1.3 miles south on private road and 100 feet
 east of road.

 RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more
 than 80 inches.

 The A horizon is very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), dark grayish
 brown through dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4), or dark
 brown (7.5YR 4/3, 4/4).  Mottles of very dark grayish brown (10YR
 3/2), pale brown (10YR 6/3), dark brown (7.5YR 4/4), or strong
 brown (7.5YR 5/6) are in some pedons.  It is sandy clay loam or
 clay loam and is very strongly through slightly acid.  The
 boundary is clear or gradual.

 The B21t horizon is red (2.5YR 4/6, 4/8), yellowish red (5YR 5/6,
 5/8), or reddish brown (5YR 4/4).  In most pedons this horizon has
 mottles of gray (10YR 6/1; 5Y 6/1), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4),
 grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), brown
 (10YR 5/3), or dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2).  It contains 45 to
 60 percent clay and is very strongly or strongly acid.

 The B22t horizon is similar in clay content and is gray (10YR 5/1,
 6/1; 5Y 5/1, 6/1), or light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), mottled with
 red (2.5YR 4/6,  4/8) very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2), dark
 grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2), or yellowish brown (10YR 5/6).  It is
 medium acid throuh neutral.

 The B3ca horizon is light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4, 5/6), brownish
 yellow (10YR 6/6), yellowish brown (10YR 5/6, 6/8), light brownish
 gray (10YR 6/4), gray (10YR 5/1, 6/1; 5Y 6/1), olive brown (2.5Y
 4/4), pale olive (5Y 6/4), or olive (5Y 5/3).  It is mottled in
 shades of red, gray, olive, and brown and is clay or shaly clay.
 It is mildly or moderately alkaline and calcareous and contains
 few to common soft bodies and concretions of calcium carbonate.

 The Cca horizon is light olive brown, gray, olive brown, pale
 yellow, or olive and is mottled in shades of red, gray, olive, or
 brown.  It is clay or shaly clay and contains few or common soft
 bodies and hard concretions of calcium carbonate.

 COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Annona, Axtell, Boswell, Colbert,
 Crockett, Gore, Kipling, Normangee, Oktibbeha, Sacul, Susquehanna,
 Wilcox, and Woodtell series.  Annona and Woodtell soils have an
 abrupt textural change between the A and Bt horizons, and in
 addition, Woodtell soils are very strongly through slightly acid
 throughout, including the C horizons.  Axtell, Crockett, and
 Normangee soils are dry in the moisture control section for longer
 periods of time.  In addition, Axtell and Crockett soils have an
 abrupt textural change between the A and Bt horizon.  Boswell,
 Susquehanna, and Wilcox soils lack a zone of carbonate
 accumulation in any part of the Bt horizon within a depth of 80
 inches.  Colbert and Oktibbeha soils have over 60 percent clay in
 the control section.  In addition, Oktibbeha soils have no gray
 colors in the upper 10 inches of the Bt horizon.  Gore soils have
 mixed mineralogy.  Kipling soils are somewhat poorly drained and
 lack soft powdery lime in the lower solum.  Sacul soils have base
 saturation of less than 35 percent.

 GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bryarly soils are on uplands.  Slope
 gradients are 0 to 8 percent but dominantly 1 to 5 percent.  These
 soils formed in calcareous clayey marine deposits.  At the type
 location, average annual rainfall is 45 inches, mean annual
 temperature is 64 degrees F., and Thornthwaite P-E index is 78.

 GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Woodtell
 series and the Deport series.  Deport soils have clay textures
 throughout and lack argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; medium to
 rapid runoff; very slow permeability.

 USE AND VEGETATION:  Principal use is pine, hardwood forest, and
 pasture.  Native forests include red oak, post oak, sweetgum,
 hickory, and shortleaf and loblolly pine.  Native grasses include
 longleaf uniola, little bluestem, purple top, and indiangrass.

 DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Coastal Plain of Northeast
 Texas.  The series is of moderate extent.

 SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Red River County, Texas; 1972.

 REMARKS:  These soils were formerly classified in the Red-Yellow
 Podzolic great soil group.
