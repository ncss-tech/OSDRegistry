BUGGIN SERIES

The Buggin series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granitic rock.  Buggin soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Sandy-skeletal, mixed, shallow Xeric Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Buggin extremely bouldery loamy coarse sand--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered with 30 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones, and 15 percent boulders.

    A1--0 to 2 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) extremely bouldery loamy coarse sand, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel, 10 percent stones, and 20 percent boulders; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (1 to 5 inches thick)

    A2--2 to 7 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loamy coarse sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine and medium granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine through medium roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 50 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 9 inches thick)

    Bw--7 to 10 inches; 70 percent brown (10YR 5/3) and 30 percent light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely gravelly coarse sandy loam, 70 percent dark brown (10YR 3/3) and 30 percent brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine through medium roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 65 percent gravel; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 4 inches thick)

    Cr--10 to 16 inches; weathered granitic rock.

    R--16 inches; hard granitic rock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Alpine County, California; on the Toiyabe National Forest about 0.6 mile north of Coyote Valley; approximately 2,150 feet north and 1,000 feet west of the southeast corner of section 5, T. 7 N., R. 22 E.; USGS Lost Cannon Peak 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; 38 degrees 28 minutes 53.1 seconds north latitude and 119 degrees 34 minutes 50.0 seconds west longitude, NAD27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Usually moist in the moisture control section during late fall, winter, and spring; dry from mid-July through September for 60 to 80 consecutive days in the four months following the summer solstice; Typic xeric moisture regime.

Mean annual soil temperature - 44 to 47 degrees F.

Mean summer soil temperature - 52 to 59 degrees F. 

Mollic epipedon thickness - 10 to 14 inches.

Depth to bedrock - 10 to 14 inches to a paralithic contact.  The paralithic materials below the contact are weathered granitic rock.  Hard, unweathered rock is within 25 inches of the soil surface.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 3 to 8 percent; Rock fragments: Averages 50 to 80 percent, mainly fine (2 to 5 mm diameter) pebbles.  Lithology of fragments are granitic rocks such as granodiorite.


A1 horizon - Value: 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma: 1 or 2 moist.
Organic matter content: 5 to 8 percent.
Reaction: Moderately acid or slightly acid.


A2 horizon - Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.
Organic matter content: 3 to 6 percent.
Texture: Very gravelly loamy coarse sand or extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand.
Reaction: Moderately acid or slightly acid.


Bw horizon (when present) - Chroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist.
Texture: Extremely gravelly coarse sandy loam or very gravelly loamy coarse sand.
Clay content: 8 to 10 percent.
Rock fragments: 50 to 80 percent.
Reaction: Moderately acid or slightly acid.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Buggin soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granitic rock.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 8,000 to 11,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 45 inches, mean annual temperature is 35 to 40 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Shalgran, Sofgran, and Temo soils.  Shalgran soils have a frigid soil temperature regime.  Sofgran soils are very deep with a paralithic contact at 60 to 80 inches.  Temo soils are sandy and have less than 60 percent base saturation in all horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; high or very high surface runoff; rapid permeability (high or very high saturated hydraulic conductivity).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Buggin soils are used for rangeland, recreation, watershed,  and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is mainly curl-leaf mountain mahogany, snowberry, mountain big sagebrush, and needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern California, on the east side of the Sierra Nevada Range.  These soils are not extensive with about 2,200 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 22A.
