BONDAD SERIES

The Bondad series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources but mostly from sandstone.  Bondad soils are on hillslopes and paleoterrace risers.  Slopes range from 12 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Calciustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bondad very cobbly loam, on a southeast facing, complex, 60 percent slope in pinyon-juniper woodland at an elevation of 2,010 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on April 26, 2005 the soil was moist from 0 to 152 cm.  The surface is covered by 10 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones.

(10 to 25 cm thick)

    Bk1--15 to 66 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely cobbly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic; common fine and  very fine, and few medium roots throughout; few very fine tubular pores; 9 percent calcium carbonate, finely disseminated throughout, and carbonate masses on bottom of rock fragments; 35 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.

    Bk2--66 to 117 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely cobbly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic; few fine, very fine, and medium roots throughout; 17 percent calcium carbonate, finely disseminated throughout, and carbonate masses on bottom of rock fragments; 35 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (combined thickness of Bk1, Bk2 - 76 to 152 cm)

    Bk3--117 to 183 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely cobbly loamy sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; loose, loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; 9 percent calcium carbonate, finely disseminated throughout, and carbonate masses on bottom of a few rock fragments; 35 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).

SERIES PROPOSED:  Archuleta County, Colorado, Archuleta Soil Survey Area, 2005.  The name is from a local geographic area.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Calcic horizon:  The zone from 15 to 152 cm.  (Bk1, Bk2, and part of the Bk3 horizons)
Particle size control section:  The zone from 25 to 102 cm. (part of the Bk1 and part of the Bk2 horizons)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

Bondad soils have a mesic temperature regime and are in an ustic soil moisture regime bordering on aridic.
