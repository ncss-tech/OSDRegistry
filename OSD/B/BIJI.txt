BIJI SERIES

The Biji series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  The Biji soils are on dissected lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

(25 to 50 cm)

    Bk3--117 to 152 cm; light gray (5Y 7/2) clay, light olive gray (5Y 6/2) moist; strong medium prismatic structure parting to common fine and medium subangular blocky; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine roots; common fine tubular pores; common prominent fine and medium irregular dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) and brown (7.5YR 4/4) iron concentrations on faces of peds and in pores; common irregular coarse secondary calcium carbonate nodules 0.5 to 1 cm in diameter and 1 to 2 cm in length; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  White Pine County, Nevada; approximately 2.2 miles east of the North Spring Valley highway on the Rogers ranch road; 1000 feet north along the fence line.  2600 feet East and 1000 feet north of the southwest corner of section 33, T 17 N., R 67 E.; USGS Yelland Dry Lake 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 17 minutes 32 second N and longitude 114 degrees 26 minutes 49 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.2922222 latitude, -114.4458333 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.  The Duffer series is a similar soil and has a fine-silty particle-size control section, and a seasonal water table between 50 and 100 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Biji soils are on dissected lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations are 1,650 to 1,865 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ewelac, Medlaval, Kolda, and Duffer.  

Ewelac soils do not have a calcic horizon.  Medlaval and Kolda soils have a mollic epipedon.  Duffer soils are fine-silty and have aquic condition in the layer from 36 to 50 cm.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained; very low to very high runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly alkali sacaton, saltgrass, rubber rabbitbrush, and black greasewood.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: East-central Nevada.  MLRA 28A.  These soils are not extensive.
