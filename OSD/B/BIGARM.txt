BIGARM SERIES

The Bigarm series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium, alluvium, or glacial till.  These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans, foothills, moraines, and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bigarm very gravelly loam, native grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 12 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; 45 percent angular gravel; neutral (pH 6.7); gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 20 inches thick)

    Bw--12 to 18 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine pores; 50 percent angular gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 21 inches thick) 

    BC--18 to 38 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and very fine roots in upper part; 50 percent angular gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 30 inches thick)

    C--38 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) extremely gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 55 percent angular gravel, 10 percent angular cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Missoula County, Montana, 1985.

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretations Record:  MT0420.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 12 inches (A horizon); a cambic horizon from 12 to 18 inches (Bw horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (A, Bw, BC, C horizons).  Bigarm soils have a xeric moisture regime and a frigid temperature regime.
