BLENCOE SERIES

The Blencoe series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on flood plains and flood-plain steps. These soils formed in 51 to 102 centimeters of clayey alluvium and underlying loamy alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 737 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey over loamy, smectitic over mixed, superactive, mesic Aquertic Hapludolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Blencoe silty clay, on a slope of about 1/2 percent, on a flood plain in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

	BCg--71 to 81 centimeters; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) silty clay loam; weak medium prismatic structure; friable; common root channels; few fine pores; few black iron and manganese oxides; few fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 13 centimeters thick)

	2Cg--81 to 152 centimeters; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silt loam; massive; friable; numerous roots and pores; few worm holes and worm casts; distinct calcium carbonate threads; distinct calcium carbonate concretions; few fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--51 to 102 centimeters of clayey alluvium and underlying loamy alluvium
Landform--flood plains and flood-plain steps
Slopes--0 to 2 percent
Elevation--152 to 366 meters above sea level
Mean annual air temperature--8 to 13 degrees C.
Mean annual precipitation--635 to 991 millimeters
Frost-free period--145 to 180 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cooper, Keg, Luton, Salix, and Woodbury soils.
Cooper--are at slightly higher elevations and have less than 35 percent clay in the silty alluvium part (upper part) of its particle-size control section.
Keg--are at the higher elevations, do not have saturated zones within a depth of 183 centimeters, and have less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.
Luton--are in lower landscape positions and have saturated zones within a depth of 30 centimeters
Salix--are at slightly higher elevations and have saturated zones within a depth of 90 to 183 centimeters. 
Woodbury--are in lower landscape positions, have saturated zones within a depth of 30 centimeters, and have 28 to 36 percent clay in the lower part of the particle-size control section. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--somewhat poorly drained--a saturated zone occurs within a depth of 30 to 90 centimeters during April to June in most years and is considered apparent
Saturated hydraulic conductivity0.42 to 4.23 micrometers per second (moderately low or moderately high) in the clayey alluvium and 4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second (moderately high or high) in the loamy alluvium
Surface runoff potential--low
Flooding--occasional or rare flooding for very brief to long periods during the months of February to November resulting from precipitation events and snowmelt 

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are cultivated. Principal crops are corn, soybeans, and small grain. Some areas have been drained by open ditches and land grading. The native vegetation is big bluestem, indiangrass, switchgrass, and other grasses of the tall grass prairie. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
LRR M, MLRAs 102B, 102C, 107B and 115B; flood plains of the Missouri River in Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska and South Dakota. This series is of moderate extent.
