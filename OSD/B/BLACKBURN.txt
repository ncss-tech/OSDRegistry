BLACKBURN SERIES

The Blackburn series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash over colluvium from argillite. These soils are on mountains. Slopes are 35 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Andic Haplocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Blackburn silt loam - forest cover.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    0i--0 to 1/2 inches; litter of needles and twigs over a dark colored layer of matted organic material.

    E--1/2 to 1 inch; white (10YR 8/1) loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; weak thin platy structure; soft, friable; slightly acid; abrupt broken boundary.  (0 to 2 inches thick)

    Bw1--1 to 4 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) with some gray spots, moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable; many medium and coarse roots; porous; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.

    Bw2--4 to 11 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) silt loam, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable; many medium and coarse roots; porous; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of Bw horizons is 7 to 15 inches)

    2A&Bb--11 to 17 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) and reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many medium and few coarse roots; many medium pores; 30 percent gravel; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (2 to 8 inches thick)

    2B&Ab1--17 to 36 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) and very pale brown (10YR 7/3) gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; faint patchy clay films in cavities; common fine roots; few medium and common fine tubular pores; 30 percent gravel; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 15 inches thick)

    2B&Ab2--36 to 42 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) and light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) and brown (7.5YR 4/4) with mottles of reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few medium roots; common fine tubular pores; 35 percent gravel; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 10 inches thick)

The 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Andic Eutrocryepts to Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Andic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.
