BELTON SERIES

The Belton series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in clayey till or glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on moraines, dissected alluvial fans, stream terraces, escarpments and dissected lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT0422.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 8 inches (Ap horizon); an argillic horizon having interfingering of albic materials from 8 to 10 inches (Bt/E horizon); a natric horizon from 10 to 19 inches (Btn and part of Bkn horizons).  Belton soils have a frigid temperature regime and a xeric moisture regime.
