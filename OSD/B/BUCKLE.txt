BUCKLE SERIES

The Buckle series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in moderately fine textured alluvium, fan alluvium, and slope alluvium derived from shale and sandstone. Buckle soils are on dipslopes of cuestas, fan terraces and fan remnants on valley sides, drainageways, hills and ridges and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Buckle silt loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

(12 to 20 inches thick)

    Btk--29 to 44 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine pores; strongly effervescent; few fine calcium carbonate accumulations; few thin clay films on faces of peds; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (10 to 21 inches thick)

    Bk1--44 to 50 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; strongly effervescent; few fine calcium carbonate accumulations; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. 

    Bk2--50 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silty clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; strongly effervescent; few fine calcium carbonate accumulations; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6). (The combined thickness of the Bk horizons are 0 to 16 inches thick)

Balon, Decolney and Gaddes soils are noncalcareous throughout. Blancot and Mentmore soils have hues of 2.5Y. Bowbac, Cushman, Gaddes, Gapbutte, Gapmesa, Hagerman, Hagerwest, Pokeman, Pugsley, and Spangler soils have a lithic or paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Cambria soils are less than 10 inches deep to the base of the Bt. Chilerojo soils have a densic horizon. Doakum soils have more sand and less silt in the control section. Los Alamos soils have pumice and ash in the control section. Oelop soils have Bt horizons with a base less than 40 inches deep. Palacid soils have calcium carbonate accumulations at 10 to 15 inches. Penistaja, Redpen, and Yenlo soils have more than 40 percent sand. Quagwa soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 54 to 57 degrees F.
