MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Nelson County, Virginia, 1988.

REMARKS:This soil was previously mapped as Manteo, a thermic soil. 

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 3 inches (Ap horizon)
Cambic horizon--the zone from 3 to 13 inches (Bw horizon)
Aquic conditions--the soil has redox depletions and concentrations within the 
Paralithic contact-13 inches (Cr horizon)
Lithic contact-18 inches (R horizon)
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 18 inches 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Ranges for morphology, chemistry, particle size distribution, and mineralogy are based on 2 pedons and the thermic counterpart to this soil.
