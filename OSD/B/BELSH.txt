BELSH SERIES

The Belsh series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils with rapid permeability that formed in colluvium from granitic rocks and volcanic ash. Slopes range from 8 to 90 percent in mountains and canyons. The average annual precipitation is about 33 inches and the average annual temperature is about 38 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, isotic Vitrixerandic Humicryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Belsh fine gravelly ashy coarse sandy loam, forested -- on a north-facing slope of 55 percent at 6,500 feet elevation. When described on August 5, 1997, the soil moist throughout. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

  Oi--0 to 1 inch; slightly decomposed forest litter.

  A--1 to 7 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine gravelly ashy coarse sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine, fine and medium irregular pores; 5 percent cobbles, 10 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.9); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 7 inches thick)

  AB--7 to 15 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) fine gravelly ashy coarse sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine, fine and medium irregular pores; 10 percent cobbles, 20 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 14 inches thick)

  2Bw--15 to 21 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very cobbly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine, fine and medium irregular pores; 5 percent stones, 25 percent cobbles, 25 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.7); gradual wavy boundary. (6 to 16 inches thick)

  2C1--21 to 37 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) extremely cobbly coarse sand, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine, fine and medium irregular pores; 10 percent stones, 50 percent cobbles, 15 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear smooth boundary. (12 to 16 inches thick)

  2C2--37 to 60 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) very gravelly coarse sand, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; 40 percent fine gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.9).

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Montchief series. The Montchief soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Belsh soils are on canyon walls, mountain slopes and ridges at elevations of 4,700 to 7,350 feet. These soils formed in colluvium from granitic rocks and volcanic ash. Slopes range from 8 to 90 percent. The average annual precipitation is 28 to 40 inches. The average annual temperature is 36 to 39 degrees F. The frost-free period is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Zan soils. Zan soils are sandy and occur on similar geomorphic positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Excessively drained; medium to very rapid runoff; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Belsh soils are used mainly for timber production and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is subalpine fir, Douglas-fir, mountain maple and thinleaf (blue) huckleberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West-central Idaho. MLRA 43B. Belsh soils are not extensive.
