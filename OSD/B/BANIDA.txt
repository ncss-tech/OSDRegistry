BANIDA SERIES

The Banida series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits and alluvium.  Banida soils are on lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, smectitic, frigid Vertic Haploxerepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Banida silty clay loam--cropland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap--0 to 6 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) silty clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine, and few coarse roots; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 7 inches thick)

    AB--6 to 9 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) silty clay, dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine, and few coarse roots; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)

    Bw1--9 to 22 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) silty clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to strong fine angular blocky; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine roots; common 1.0 to 1.5 cm wide vertical cracks filled with brown (7.5YR 5/2) surface material; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); clear wavy boundary.  (7 to 13 inches thick)

    Bw2--22 to 29 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) silty clay, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; common 1.0 to 2.5 cm wide vertical cracks filled with brown (7.5YR 5/2) surface material; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (7 to 30 inches thick)

    Bw3--29 to 35 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) silty clay, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine angular blocky; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; common 1.0 to 4.0 cm wide vertical cracks filled with brown (7.5YR 5/2) surface materials; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 18 inches thick)

    Bk1--35 to 40 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) silty clay, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) moist; moderate fine prismatic structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; few fine carbonate threads; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 6 inches thick)

    Bk2--40 to 64 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) silty clay, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) moist; massive; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Franklin County, Idaho; about 8.5 miles northeast of Preston; approximately 1,800 feet west and 1,800 feet north of the southeast corner of section 12, T. 14 S., R. 39 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Mean annual soil temperature - 45 to 47 degrees F.

Depth to carbonates - 20 to 36 inches.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 40 to 55 percent.

Reaction - Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.

Linear extensibility (LE) - 6 to 9 cm.


Ap horizon - Hue: 5YR or 7.5YR.
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.


Bw horizons - Value: 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist.
Cracks thickness: 1.0 through 5.0 cm.


Bk horizons - Hue: 5YR or 7.5YR.
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist.
Texture: Silty clay or clay.
Effervescence: Slight or strong.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 5 to 15 percent
Gypsum content: 0 to 5 percent

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Magic, Market, and Oxford series.

Magic soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Market soils have hue of 10YR through 5Y.  Oxford soils are effervescent throughout and have redox concentrations in the lower part of the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform: dissected lake terraces
Parent Material: local alluvium and lake sediments
Elevation: 4,700 to 5,200 feet
Slope: 0 to 30 percent
Precipitation: 15 to 18 inches; mostly in the winter in the form of snow
Mean annual summer temperature: 61 to 66 degrees F.
Mean annual air temperature: 42 to 45 degrees F.
Frost-free period: 90 to 110 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Oxford soil and the Ant Flat, Manila, and Yago soils.  Ant Flat soils have mollic epipedons 10 to 19 inches thick, argillic horizons, and occur in concave areas along drainageways. Manila soils have argillic horizons with hue yellower than 7.5YR.  Yago soils are clayey-skeletal.  Manila and Yago soils are on footslopes of mountains and fan remnants.  Oxford soils are on convex slopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; medium to very high surface runoff; very slow permeability (low or moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Banida soils are used mainly for dryland crops.  Almost all areas of the soil are cropped.  The natural vegetation is assumed to have been mountain big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, and sod-forming grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRAs 13 and 28A.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Bannock County, Idaho, 1983.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 9 inches (Ap and AB horizons).

Cambic horizon - The zone from 9 to 35 inches (Bw1, Bw2, and Bw3 horizons).

Identifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 35 to 40 inches (Bk1 horizon).

Vertic subgroup feature - The zone from the soil surface to 40 inches with linear extensibility of 6.0 cm or more; additional support for the concept is based on the cracks described in the Bw horizons.

Particle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (Bw2, Bw3, and Bk1 horizons and part of the Bw1 horizon).
