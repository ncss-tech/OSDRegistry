BLACKSTON SERIES

The Blackston series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and slope alluvium that may be underlain by residuum derived from mixed sources.  Blackston soils are on edges of old high terraces, on fan remnants and on structural benches.  Slopes range from 0 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Clifsand, Seeg, Stent and Utaline soils.  

Clifsand, Seeg and Stent soils have less than 18 percent clay in the upper part of the particle-size control section.

Utaline soils have 18 to 35 percent clay throughout the particle-size control section.

Landform:  high terraces, fan remnants and structural benches
Slope:  0 to 40 percent
Elevation:  4,900 to 6,300 feet 
Mean annual precipitation:  5 to 9 inches
Mean annual temperature:  48 to 52 degrees F.
Mean summer temperature:  70 to 74 degrees F.
Frost-free period:  125 to 160 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Avalon, Farb, and Persayo soils and the competing Utaline soils.  Farb soils have a lithic contact above 20 inches.  Avalon soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Persayo soils have a paralithic contact above 20 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; negligible to high runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally as native pastureland.  Native vegetation is mainly scattered snakeweed, cactus, and galleta grass.  In Utah this soil has been correlated to the Desert Loam and Desert Stony Loam (Shadscale-Bud Sagebrush) range sites.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The western slope of Colorado and adjoining parts of  eastern and central Utah.  The series is of moderate extent.
