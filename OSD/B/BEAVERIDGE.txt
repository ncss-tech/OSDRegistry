BEAVERIDGE SERIES

The Beaveridge series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rock over residuum weathered from sandstone and shale.  These soils are on eroded fan remnants and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 430 mm and annual air temperature is about 1 degree C.
