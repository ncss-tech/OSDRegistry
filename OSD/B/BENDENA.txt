BENDENA SERIES

The Bendena series consists of shallow and very shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils on uplands. They formed mainly in residuum weathered from limestone. Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 91 centimeters, and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, smectitic, mesic Lithic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Bendena silty clay loam - rangeland. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

  A--0 to 20 centimeters; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; firm, slightly hard, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; 1 percent flat very angular indurated 2 to 5 millimeter limestone fragments and 2 percent flat very angular 20 to 75 millimeter limestone fragments and 2 percent flat very angular indurated 5 to 30 millimeter limestone fragment; clear smooth boundary.

  R--20 to 30 centimeters; indurated level bedded, fractured, limestone bedrock. The upper part has dark colored soil in the cracks. 

TYPE LOCATION: Jefferson County, Kansas; located about 1500 feet north and 1200 feet west of the southeast corner, Sec. 22, T. 10 S., R. 18 E.; USGS Ozawkie topographic quadrangle; lat. 39 degrees 9 minutes 7.10 seconds N. and long; 95 degrees 23 minutes 6.90 seconds W., NAD 83; 433747 meters easting, 293079 meters northing.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture; The soil moisture control section is Udic moisture regime 
Depth to lithic contact; 10 to 50 centimeters to limestone bedrock 
Thickness of the mollic epipedon; 10 to 50 centimeters

A horizon; 
Hue; 10 YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y 
Value; 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry 
Chroma; 1 to 3
Texture; Silty clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay
Clay content; 35 to 55 percent
Sand content: less than 5 percent fine sand or coarser material 
Reaction: slightly acid to moderately alkaline

Some pedons have a thin AC, or C horizon.
In some pedons, the limestone is more weathered, and is highly fractured.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series for this soil

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material; clayey residuum from limestone bedrock 
Landform: sloping shoulders and moderately sloping to very steep side slopes on uplands 
Slopes: 2 to 50 percent 
Mean annual temperature; 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F) 
Mean annual precipitation; 86 to 97 centimeters  
Frost free period; 165 to 185 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chillicothe, Elmont, Gymer, Knox, Martin, Oska, Padonia, Palermo, Rosendale, Vinland, and Wamego soils.
Chillicothe soils are higher on the landscape and have a depth to limestone that is greater than 152 centimeters.
Elmont soils are lower on the landscape and are derived from shale.Gymer and Martin soils are lower on the landscape.
Knox soils are higher on the landscape, are well drained, and do not have a lithic contact within 203 centimeters.
Oska soils are slightly higher on the landscape and have a lithic contact within 51 to 102 centimeters.Padonia soils are formed in weathered calcareous shale.
Palermo soils are higher on the landscape, are well drained, and do not have a lithic contact within 203 centimeters.
Rosendale soils are lower on the landscape and derived from shale.
Vinland and Wamego soils are on similar landscape positions, but formed in weathered noncalcareous shale.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage: somewhat excessively drained
Runoff: medium or rapid
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: moderate

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in pasture or woodland. Native vegetation is prairie grasses and hardwood trees. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern Kansas and possibly in northwestern Missouri and southeastern Nebraska; moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Doniphan County, Kansas, 1998.

REMARKS: These soils were previously included with the Sogn series in mapping. Sogn soils are Haplustolls and typically are in a drier climate.

Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon include: mollic epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 20 centimeters, lithic contact - bedrock at 20 to 30 centimeters. 

09/2008 GJJ changed from loamy to clayey, removed mixed, superactive and replaced with smectitic, fixed range in characteristics, added metric conversions, removed English 
units, and made some format changes.
