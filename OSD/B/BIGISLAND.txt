BIGISLAND SERIES

The Bigisland series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in 100 to 150 centimeters of sandy-skeletal alluvium over dense, loamy till. These soils are on risers on stream terraces in river valleys.  Slope ranges from 15 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 750 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Clemens, Dairyland, and Makwa soils.
Clemens--are on lower landscape positions on flood plains and stream terraces and have a frequently saturated zone between depths of 0.3 to 0.75 meter during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Dairyland--are on less sloping landscape positions on floodplains and stream terraces and have a frequently saturated zone between depths of 0.6 to 1.0 meter during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Makwa--are on lower landscape positions and are frequently saturated from the surface of the soil to a depth of 0.3 meters during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of 30 year mean of annual precipitation

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class--somewhat excessively drained--a frequently saturated zone does not occur within a depth of 1.8 meters during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--14.00 to 141.00 micrometers per second in the sandy-skeletal alluvium and 0.07 to 0.40 micrometers per second in the till

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Most areas are forested. The native vegetation is mixed deciduous and coniferous forest with principal species of northern red oak, northern pin oak, white oak, white ash, American basswood, quaking aspen, bigtooth aspen, American elm, yellow birch, sugar maple, and black cherry.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  St. Paul, Minnesota; MLRA SSO 10-4 (Duluth, Minnesota).

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Burnett County, Wisconsin, 2004. 

REMARKS: 
Particle size control section--the zone from a depth of 33 to 64 centimeters (Bt) and the zone from a depth of 119 to 138 centimeters (Bt');
series control section--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 8 centimeters (A horizon);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 33 to 64 centimeters and from a depth of 119 to 142 centimeters (Bt and Bt' horizons);
densic contact--the contact with till at a depth of 142 centimeters (2Cd horizon);
udic moisture regime.

The typical pedon for the series was described on the edge of a gravel pit in 2003.  Due to further excavation the location of the typical pedon for the series was moved 150 feet west on 9-7-06.  The pedon at this location has not been described at this time (9-7-06) but is similar to the pedon described in this description.
