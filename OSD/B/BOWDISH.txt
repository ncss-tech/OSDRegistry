BOWDISH SERIES 

The Bowdish series consists of moderately deep; well drained soils that are formed in residuum derived dominantly from sandstone and interbedded shale. Bowdish soils are on dipslopes, mesas, benches, ridges, and escarpments and have slopes of 1 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Haplocalcids 

TYPICAL PEDON: Bowdish loam - Pinon-Juniper woodland. (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

A--0 to 5 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick)

Bw--5 to 12 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; lime disseminated throughout; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 12 inches thick)

Bk--12 to 23 inches; pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) gravelly loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; 15 percent gravel; lime disseminated throughout; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick)

R--23 inches; hard sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION: Montrose County, Colorado, about 2.5 miles west and 3.5 miles north of Uravan, 150 feet east and 700 feet south of the northwest corner, sec. 18, T. 48 N., R. 17 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Depth to the calcic horizon: 5 to 20 inches

Depth to the lithic contact: 20 to 40 inches.

A and Bw horizons 
Hue: 7.5YR or 5YR 
Value: 4 to 6, 4 or 5 moist 
Chroma: 2 to 4 
Rock fragment content: 0 to 30 percent (predominantly gravel and cobble)
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline

Bk horizon 
Hue: 10YR to 2.5YR 
Value: 5 to 8, 3 to 6 moist 
Chroma: 3 to 6 
Texture: loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, silt loam or thin layers of sandy loam.
Clay content: 18 to 35 percent 
Rock fragment content: 0 to 30 percent (predominantly gravel) 
Reaction: moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline 
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 15 to 40 percent 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Abra (AZ), Bighams (AZ), Copeman (WY), Creel, Darvey (NM), Hernandez (NM), Honlu (UT), Kimera (CO), Numa (CO), Peachsprings (AZ), and Xenmack (NM) series. 
Abra, Copeman, Darvey, Hernandez, Honlu, Kimera, Numa, and Peachsprings soils are very deep to a lithic or a paralithic contact.
Pultney soils have 10YR and yellower hues, and have 10 to 15 percent exchangeable sodium in the Cky horizon. 
Bighams and Xenmack soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. 
Creel soils have soil temperatures of 54 to 59 degrees F.  In addition, Creel, Darvey, and Numa soils are in the Western Great Plains (LRR-G) and are more moist in May and June.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bowdish soils are on dipslopes, mesas, benches, and escarpments.  Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent.  The soil formed in residuum derived dominantly from interbedded sandstone, limestone, and shale. Elevation ranges from 5,000 to 7,300 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 15 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 110 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Pinon, Clovis, and Progresso soils.  Pinon soils have bedrock at less than 20 inches.  Clovis soils are deep and have an argillic horizon.  Progresso soils have an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to very rapid runoff; moderate to moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: They are used for limited livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is pinyon pine and Utah juniper with an understory of big sagebrush, galleta grass, Indian ricegrass, and salina wildrye.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwestern Colorado. The series is of moderate extent.
