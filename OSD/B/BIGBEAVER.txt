BIGBEAVER SERIES 

The Bigbeaver series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in alluvium.  These soils are on floodplains. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, acid, frigid Aeric Fluvaquents 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bigbeaver silt loam (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted). 

     A--0 to 4 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 9 inches thick) 

     C1--4 to 9 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; few distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redox concentrations; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 10 inches thick) 

     C2--9 to 18 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; few distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redox concentrations; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); gradual wavy boundary. (5 to 14 inches thick) 

     C3--18 to 26 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redox concentrations; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); gradual wavy boundary. (5 to 15 inches thick) 

     C4--26 to 36 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redox concentrations; strongly acid (pH 5.2); gradual wavy boundary. (6 to 14 inches thick) 

     C5--36 to 60 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) stratified silt loam, very fine sandy loam, and loam, light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redox concentrations; strongly acid (pH 5.2).

REMARKS: Soil Interpretation Record:  MT1386.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches mixed (A, C1 horizons); stratified soil material from 36 to 60 inches (C5 horizon); a particle size control section from 10 to 40 inches (C2, C3, C4, and C5 horizons).
