BRYAN SERIES

The Bryan series consists of deep and very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from deeply weathered quartz diorite and related rocks.  Bryan soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes are 5 to 70 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 750mm, and the average annual air temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform - mountain slopes
Elevation - 1,275 to 2,135 meters
Slope - 5 to 70 percent (dominant slopes are 30 to 50 percent)

Mean annual precipitation - 625 to 1,150  mm
Mean annual air temperature - 2.2 to 7.2 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ligget, Pyle, and Scriver series. The Ligget soils are moderately coarse textured. The Pyle soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock. The Scriver soils have an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Excessively drained; medium or rapid runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for forestry, watershed, wildlife, grazing, and recreation. Most areas have a mixed conifer stand of Douglas-fir, white fir, and subalpine fir with ponderosa pine and lodgepole pine less frequent components. The ground cover consists of tall brush species including ninebark, tall huckleberry, mountain ash, thimbleberry and tag alder.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: This series is moderately extensive in the border zones of the Idaho Batholith. It is about 45,000 acres in extent. MLRA 43B.
