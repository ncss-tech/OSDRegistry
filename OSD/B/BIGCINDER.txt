BIGCINDER SERIES 

The Bigcinder series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and cinders. Bigcinder soils are on north-facing slopes on cinder cones.  Slopes are 20 to 40 percent.  Permeability is rapid. The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 40 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-skeletal over fragmental or cindery, aniso, glassy Humic Xeric Vitricryands

TYPICAL PEDON: Bigcinder ashy sandy loam - on a 40 percent slope at an elevation of 6,500 feet in rangeland. Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. When described on June 4, 1997, the soil was dry. 

	A1--0 to 2 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) ashy sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine and few medium and coarse roots, common very fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel-size cinders; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 4 inches thick)

(3 to 8 inches thick) 

	2C--10 to 20 inches; black (10YR 2/1) gravel, black (10YR 2/1) moist; single grained; loose; common very fine and fine and few medium and coarse roots; many very fine to medium and few coarse interstitial pores; 99 percent gravel-size cinders; clear smooth boundary. (8 to 15 inches thick) 

	3A1--20 to 24 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly ashy loamy sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; single grained; loose; few very fine and fine and few medium and coarse roots; common very fine to medium interstitial pores; 45 percent gravel-size cinders; neutral (pH 6.9); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 8 inches thick) 

	3A2--24 to 30 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly ashy loamy sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; single grained; loose; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine to medium interstitial pores; 50 percent gravel-size cinders; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 12 inches thick)

COMPETING SERIES: This are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bigcinder soils are on north-facing slopes of cinder cones. Elevation is 5,500 to 6,500 feet. Slopes are 20 to 40 percent. The soils are formed in recent ash and cinders from the Craters of the Moon volcanics. The average annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches, most of which falls as snow. The average annual air temperature is 38 to 42 degrees F. The frost-free season is 50 to 70 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Echocrater, Infernocone, and Northcrater soils and cinder land. These soils are frigid and lack the characteristic limber pine vegetation.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. slow runoff. Rapid
over very rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used for wildlife and limited livestock grazing. Vegetation is limber pine, aspen, mountain big sagebrush, snowberry, bitterbrush, pine reedgrass, and Idaho fescue. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Idaho. This series is of limited extent.
