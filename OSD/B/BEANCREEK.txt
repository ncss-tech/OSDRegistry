BEANCREEK SERIES

The Beancreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium or eolian deposits.  Beancreek soils are on fan remnants, mountain slopes and dunes. Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Calcic Haplocryolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Beancreek fine sandy loam on a 2 percent slope in rangeland at about 2025 meters elevation. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

   A--0 to 12 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium and fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; trace of  gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 20 cm thick)

   Bw--12 to 31 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; trace of gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 40 cm thick)

   Bk1--31 to 56 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; trace of gravel; 22 percent soft masses of calcium carbonate and finely disseminated carbonates; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2) gradual wavy boundary.

   Bk2--56 to 76 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) fine sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; trace of gravel; 8 percent soft masses of calcium carbonate and finely disseminated carbonates; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4) gradual wavy boundary. (combined thickness of Bk horizons 40 to 125 cm thick)

   C--76 to 152 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; trace of gravel; finely disseminated carbonates; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).
