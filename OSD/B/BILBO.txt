BILBO SERIES

The Bilbo series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks and in some areas colluvium from shale, sandstone and conglomerate.  Bilbo soils occur on side slopes of fan piedmont remnants, fan remnant partial ballenas, hills, plateaus and some inset fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Berning, Clenage, Havingdon, Lambranch, Maderbak, Pula, Surgem, Tanawit, Tenmile, Vanwyper and Zephan series.  

Berning soils have 100 to more than 150 cm thick solums and lack Bk horizons.  Clenage, Havingdon, Maderbak, Surgem and Vanwyper soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Lambranch and Pula soils lack carbonates in their profile. Tanawit soils a  2C horizon with sandy loam, silt loam or loam derived from thinly stratified sedimentary deposits. Tenmile soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 11 to 13 degrees  C, and lack carbonates within 50 to 100 cm.  Zephan soils have a lithic contact at 100 to 150 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bilbo soils are on sideslopes of fan piedmont remnants, hills, partial ballenas, plateaus and some inset fan remnants. They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks and in some areas in colluvium from shale, sandstone or conglomerate.  Elevations are 1,465 to 2,135 meters.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  The climate is cool, semiarid with moist winters and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and frost-free season is 80 to 120 days.
