BREITENBACH SERIES  

The Breitenbach series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium on fans and stream terraces.  Permeability is moderate in  the upper part and very rapid in the lower part.  Slopes are 0 to 20  percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcidic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Breitenbach loam--on a 1 percent southwest-facing  slope at 5,320 feet in rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless  otherwise noted.  When described on August 29, 1988, the soil was dry  throughout.)  

    A1--0 to 3 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak thin platy structure; slightly hard, very friable,  nonsticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common  very fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7);  clear smooth boundary.  

    A2--3 to 9 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3)  moist; moderate fine platy structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky  and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine  tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth  boundary.  (Combined thickness of the A horizons is 7 to 14 inches)  

    Bw--9 to 17 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure;  slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common very  fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; 15 percent  gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 10  inches thick)  

    2Bk--17 to 30 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly sandy loam,  dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium platy structure; hard,  firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots;  common very fine tubular pores; 35 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles;  lime coatings on undersides of coarse fragments; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 20 inches  thick)  

    2Bkq1--30 to 34 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) extremely gravelly  sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky  structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very  fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 65 percent gravel, 5 percent  cobbles; lime coatings and silica pendants 1 to 2 mm thick on undersides  of coarse fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0);  clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 20 inches thick)  

    3Bkq2--34 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly  loamy sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common  very fine and few fine roots; 70 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles;  lime coatings and silica pendants 2 to 3 mm thick on undersides of  coarse fragments; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).  

TYPE LOCATION:  Butte County, Idaho; about 2 miles southeast of Arco,  Idaho; about 1,600 feet west and about 600 feet north of the southeast  corner of section 5, T. 3 N., R. 27 E.  Latitude - 43 degrees, 36 minutes, 41 seconds North;  Longitude - 113 degrees, 15 minutes, 42 seconds West.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Darlington series.  Darlington soils lack a calcic horizon and accumulations of silica.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Breitenbach soils are on fans and stream terraces at  elevations of 3,000 to 6,500 feet.  The soils formed in alluvium. Slopes  range from 0 to 20 percent.  The climate is cold and moist in winter and  spring and dry in summer.  The average annual air temperature is 38 to  43 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches.  The  frost-free period is 70 to 100 days.  

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Elbow,  Sanfelipe,  Simeroi, Sparmo and Stan series.  Elbow soils are on outwash fans  and fan terraces and have duripans.  Sanfelipe soils are on outwash fans  and terraces and have carbonatic mineralogy.  Sparmo and Simeroi soils  are on outwash fans and terraces and lack mollic epipedons.  Stan soils  are on outwash fans and terraces and have coarse-loamy particle-size  control sections.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Slow runoff.  Moderate  permeability in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part.  

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and irrigated cropland.  The native  vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central Idaho.  These soils are not  extensive.
