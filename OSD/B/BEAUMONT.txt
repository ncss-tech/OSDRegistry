BEAUMONT SERIES

The Beaumont series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils on coastal plains. These nearly level soils formed in clayey sediments on the Beaumont Formation of the Pleistocene Age. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 20.5 degrees C (69 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1397 mm (55 in).

TYPE LOCATION: Jefferson County, TX; from the intersection of Interstate Highway 10 and U.S. Highway 90 in Beaumont; 12.2 miles west on U.S. Highway 90; 4.6 miles south on South China Road; 1.0 mile east on county road; 0.5 mile south on field road; 150 feet west in cropland. Latitude: 29N, 58, 39; Longitude: 94W, 19, 50. NAD 83; UTM Zone 15  

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Undisturbed areas have gilgai microrelief with microknolls 10 to 38 cm (4 to 15 in) above the microdepressions. When dry, cracks 1 to more than 2 cm (1/2 to more than 1 in) wide at the surface extend to a depth of 30 cm (12 in) or more. Cracks remain open for less than 60 cumulative days in most years. Depth to slickensides and wedge shaped peds begin at a depth ranging from 20 to 61 cm (8 to 24 in). Iron-manganese concretions and/or masses range from few to common.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the China, League, Harris and Viterbo series. 
China and League soils: on slightly higher landform
Harris soils: in marsh
Viterbo soils: have an argillic horizon

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained.  Permeability is very slow.  Runoff is negligible.  

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for native pasture or rice production. Rice is usually grown on a 1 in 4 year rotation. Improved pastures are mostly bahiagrass. Native grasses are mainly little bluestem, indiangrass, eastern gamagrass, switchgrass, Flordia paspalum, big bluestem, brownseed paspalum, knotroot bristlegrass, sedges and rushes. In some areas pine and hardwood trees have encroached.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Gulf Coast Prairie of Texas east of the Trinity River; LRR T; MLRA 150A; the series is of moderate extent.
