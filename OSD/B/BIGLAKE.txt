BIGLAKE SERIES

The Biglake series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium.  These soils are on stream terraces and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Typic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Biglake gravelly sandy loam, in grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 9 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine and medium granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many fine pores; 20 percent angular gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)

    Bw--9 to 16 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; common fine pores; 40 percent angular gravel and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 14 inches thick)

    C--16 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely gravelly loamy sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky, and nonplastic; few very fine roots in upper part; 55 percent angular gravel and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - stream terraces, alluvial fans and hills.
Elevation - 2,500 to 4,500 feet.
Slope - 0  to 30 percent.
Parent material - alluvium or colluvium.
Climate - long cold winters, moist springs and falls, and warm dry summers.
Mean annual precipitation - 14 to 19 inches, much of which falls as snow and spring rain.
Mean annual temperature - 42 to 46 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 80 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Excessively drained; moderately rapid permeability to a depth of 16 inches and rapid below.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Biglake soils are used for rangeland and irrigated cropland.  Potential native vegetation is mainly Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, prairie junegrass, forbs and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Biglake soils are of limited extent in mountain valleys in western Montana.  MLRA 44A.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Missoula County, Montana, 1985.

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretation Records:  MT1013.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from soil surface to 9 inches (A horizon); a cambic horizon from 9 to 16 inches (Bw horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bw, C horizons).  Biglake soils have a xeric moisture regime and a frigid temperature regime.
