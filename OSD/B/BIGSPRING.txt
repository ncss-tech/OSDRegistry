BIGSPRING SERIES

The Bigspring series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from limestone and welded tuff over lacustrine deposits. Bigspring soils are on stream terraces and basin-floor remnants. Slopes are 2 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bigspring soils are on stream terraces and basin-floor remnants. These soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from limestone and welded tuff over lacustrine deposits. Slopes are 2 to 4 percent. Elevations range from 1,650 to 1,740 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm but ranges as low as 150 mm where additional moisture is available as run-on moisture, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 14 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 120 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Greatday, Kunzler, Littlespring, and Slaw soils. The Greatday, Kunzler, Littlespring and Slaw soils do not have mollic epipedons. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained, high runoff, moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Bigspring soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The potential vegetation is mainly basin big sagebrush, black greasewood, basin wildrye and Indian ricegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28A.
