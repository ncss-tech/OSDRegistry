BUTCHERKNIFE SERIES

Other features:  parent material is tuff bedrock of the Duff and Pruett Formations

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Borunda (TX) series.  Borunda soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Butcherknife soils are on broad alluvial flats of late-Pleistocene age.  Slopes are dominantly less than 1 percent, but range up to 3 percent.  The soils formed in fine textured residuum and alluvium derived from tuffaceous materials of the Duff and Pruett Formations.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 15 inches, with most occurring from July to September.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 62 to 68 degrees F.  Frost free period ranges from 210 to 260 days, and elevation ranges from 3,500 to 5,000 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Beewon, Borunda, Chilicotal, Quadria, and Straddlebug series.  Beewon and Quadria soils have argillic horizons and are on mid-Pleistocene pediments and are higher in the landscape.  Borunda soils are in the fine-loamy family, and are moderately deep to tuffaceous bedrock.  They are on convex erosional hillslopes and pediments.  Chilicotal soils are in the loamy-skeletal family, and are on alluvial fans.  Straddlebug soils are in the fine-loamy family, and are on gently sloping Holocene-age alluvial flats and floodplains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is slow.  Runoff is low on slopes less than 1 percent and medium on 1 to 3 percent slopes.  Overland flow may occur once in 7 to 20 years for a duration of less than 2 days.  When overland flow occurs it is usually in the months of July through September.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used entirely for livestock grazing.  Native vegetation is mainly drought tolerant short to mid grasses such as tobosagrass, vine mesquite, blue grama, cane bluestem, sideoats grama, and alkali sacaton.  Woody species consist mainly of mesquite.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West Texas. MLRA 42.  The series is moderately extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Brewster County, Texas, 1997.  The name is from Butcherknife Hill, near the type location.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 4 inches (A horizon)

Gypsic horizon - The zone from 22 to 41 inches (Bkyz, BCkyz, BCkyz horizons).  Gypsum content determined by the water loss method of Nelson, Klameth and Nettleton, 1978, SSSA Journal 42: 659-661

Calcic horizon - The zone from 30 to 41 inches (BCkyz horizons)

Ustic feature - The moisture control section is dry in all parts for less than three-fourths of the time (cumulative) when the soil temperature at a depth of 50 cm is 5 degrees Centigrade or higher, and has an aridic moisture regime that borders on an ustic moisture regime

Superactive cation activity class - CEC to percent clay ratio is 0.60 or greater.  This is assumed from the abundant zeolitic minerals in the Duff and Pruett Tuffs, and laboratory data from similar soils in Presidio County, Texas.

These soils were previously included in the Verhalen series
