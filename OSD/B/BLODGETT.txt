BLODGETT SERIES

The Blodgett series consist of shallow, well drained soils that formed in loamy colluvium derived from sandstone or siltstone. Blodgett soils occur on summits and shoulder slopes of mountains. Slopes are 30 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 110 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

Burntwoods, Chinitimini, Fiverivers, Grassmountain and Oldblue soils occur on summits and side slopes of mountains. Luckiamute, Lurnick and Maryspeak soils occur in a cryic temperature regime on adjacent higher mountain slopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, recreation, wildlife habitat and watersheds. Potential native vegetation is Douglas fir, western hemlock, salal, western swordfern, red huckleberry, cascade Oregongrape, vine maple, little prince's pine, evergreen violet, summer coralroot and Pacific trillium. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central portion of the Coast Range Mountains in Oregon; MLRA 1. This series is of small extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Benton County, Oregon, 2004. The name is taken from the community of Blodgett in western Benton County.
 
REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include: 

Ochric epipedon - from the mineral soil surface to a depth of 6 inches (A horizon). 
Cambic horizon - from 6 to 16 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).
 
Andic feature - from mineral soil surface to 6 inches (A horizon). Based on lab data from similar soils and field observations. This soil does not classify into an Andic subgroup since the Lithic subgroup classifies out first in the Keys to Soil Taxonomy. Medial modifiers were used for those horizons meeting the andic subgroup criteria although not meeting andic soil properties. A proposal was submitted to NSSC (2000) to revise the definition of medial to also include those soil properties qualifying for the Andic subgroup under criteria #1 for andic soil properties. 

Lithic subgroup - very strongly cemented sandstone at 19 inches 

Particle-size control section (Loamy-skeletal family) - from 11 to 16 inches (Bw2 horizon). 

The Cr over R bedrock is recognized as a diagnostic feature for this series. 

Depths to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.
