06/2018--Changed from previous classification of loamy-skeletal, isotic, mesic Vitrandic Dystroxerepts. Existing laboratory data does not reflect the presence of adequate quantities of volcanic glass to support the Vitrandic subgroup. This OSD was edited according to SSR01 Technical Note--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 11/2017).
