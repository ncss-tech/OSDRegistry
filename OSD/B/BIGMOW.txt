BIGMOW SERIES

The Bigmow series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from rhyolite and sedimentary rock with an influence of volcanic ash in the upper part. Slopes are 1 to 70 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches.

(10 to 20 inches thick)

2Cr--50 inches; weathered sedimentary rock

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Diffin and Yawkey series.. Diffin soils lack the vitrandic properties in the upper 7 to 10 inches of the solum.  Yawkey soils have a mollic epipedon over 20 inches thick.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Bigmow soils are on uplands at elevations of 3,500 to 5,200 feet. Slope gradients are 1 to 70 percent. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from rhyolitic tuffs and marine sediments with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface. The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 26 inches, mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F, mean summer temperature is 58 to 62 degrees F, and the mean winter temperature is 27 to 32 degrees F. The frost-free period is 20 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Volspring - on sideslopes and benches; very deep; with ash mantle 14 to 20 inches thick.
Moeo - on mountain sideslopes and benches; shallow to bedrock.
Laycock - on hillsides, shallow to bedrock.
Burntcabin - in swales, drainageways and toeslopes; fine-loamy; very deep.
Forbord - on sideslopes and benches of hills and mountains; fine-loamy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well-drained; medium to very rapid runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used for timber production with limited summer range. Other uses are wildlife, recreation and water supply purposes. Native plants are ponderosa pine, western juniper, mountain big sage, whorteleaf snowberry, bluebunch wheatgrass, mountain brome and Wheeler bluegrass. This series is characterized by what is called the moist and dry ponderosa pine forest plant association groups.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA: 10 Central Oregon.  This series is not extensive.
