Groshon soils occur on similar positions as Botero and have mollic epipedons and argillic horizons. 
Lachapella soils occur on similar positions as Botero and have mollic epipedons and do not have calcic horizons.
Lassel soils occur on similar positions as Botero and have mollic epipedons and do not have calcic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Permeability is moderate in the in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part. Runoff is negligible to low. Flood hazard is rare. Depth to water table is 36 to 50 inches from May to July.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally as forested rangeland, irrigated hayland, or irrigated pasture.  Principal vegetation includes Engelmann spruce, Rocky Mountain juniper, potentilla, western wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, sedge, rush, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Present known distribution limited to the southwestern part of Wyoming.  MLRA 34A. The series is of small extent.

SERIES PROPOSED:  The Soil Survey of Uinta County, Wyoming, 2003.  Series name taken from the name of an irrigation ditch in Uinta County.

REMARKS:  
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon:  from 0 to 8 cm.  (A horizon)

Calcic horizon:  from 76to 97 cm.  (Bk1 horizon)
Endosaturation:  The zone of saturation at 102 to 203 cm.
Lithologic discontinuity:  At the upper boundary of the 2Bk2 horizon because of the change in color and texture.
