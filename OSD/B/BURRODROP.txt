COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Burrodrop soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. These soils formed in mixed alluvium. Elevations are 1,150 to 1,600 feet. The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 5 inches; mean annual air temperature is 70 to 73 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 320 to 360 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Carrizo, Rositas, and Sunrock soils. Carrizo and Rositas soils are in inset fans and on dunes, and have sandy-skeletal and sandy particle-size control sections, respectively. Sunrock soils are on mountains, are shallow to bedrock and have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; low to medium runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Burrodrop soils are used for military exercises and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly sparse desert holly and creosotebush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mojave Desert of southeastern California. MLRA 30. These soils are of small extent.
