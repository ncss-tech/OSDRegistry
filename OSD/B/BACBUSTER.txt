BACBUSTER SERIES

The Bacbuster series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in interbedded sandstone, siltstone, mudstone, and shale residuum.  These soils are on sedimentary plains, hills and escarpments.  Slopes are 2 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bacbuster clay loam, in rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 4 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist, moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and few medium roots; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 11 inches thick)

    Bt1--4 to 9 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 10 percent soft shale chips; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. 

    Bt2--9 to 15 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and very plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common prominent clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 20 percent soft shale chips; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.

(0 to 12 inches thick)

    Bk--25 to 36 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; 50 percent soft shale chips; many medium threads of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 21 inches thick)

    Cr--36 to 60 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) semi-consolidated shale; few lime coatings on shale fragments.
