COMPETING SERIES: These are the Blount, Del Rey, Fulton, Kimmell, Mahoning, and Nappanee series. Blount and Kimmell soils have more than 22 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the C horizon. Del Rey and Fulton soils average less than 2 percent rock fragments below 51 cm (20 inches). Mahoning soils have rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section that are dominantly shale and siltstone. Nappanee soils average more than 42 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bennington soils are on flats and slight rises on ground moraines and end moraines of Wisconsin age. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. They formed in loamy till of medium calcium carbonate content. Rock fragments are mainly sandstone and shale. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 864 to 1067 mm (34 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from (9 to 13 degrees C 49 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 145 to 180 days. Elevation is 244 to 366 meters (800 to 1,200 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alexandria, Amanda, Cardington, Centerburg, Condit, and Pewamo soils that are in toposequences with Bennington soils. The well drained Alexandria and Amanda soils are on gently sloping to steep ridges and side slopes along drainageways. The moderately well drained Cardington and Centerburg soils are on summits, shoulders, and back slopes. The very poorly drained Condit soils are in depressions. The very poorly drained Pewamo soils have mollic epipedons and are in depressions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent perched water table ranges from 15 to 30 cm (0.5 to 1 foot) between November and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low. Permeability is slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. Corn, soybeans, small grain, and hay are the principal crops. Some areas are in pasture or woodland. Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central and north-central Ohio; MLRAs 111E and 139. The type location is in MLRA 111E. The series is of large extent, about 450,000 acres.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Licking County, Ohio, 1930.

REMARKS: Existing data on clay mineralogy is not conclusive. Areas of Bennington soils in MLRA 99 will be evaluated for a new series during modernization projects. Bennington soils were mapped on lake plain physiography in Sandusky, Huron, and Erie counties.

The area of the present type location is undergoing urbanization. A new pedon and location will need to be selected in the near future.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 25 cm (Ap, BE horizons).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 25 to 74 cm (Btg, Bt horizons).
Aquic conditions: redox features in all horizons between a depth of 20 and 137 cm.

A bedrock substratum phase is recognized.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory characterization data is available for a pedon near DL-16, the typical pedon, and for pedons DL-21, ER-31, FR-43, FR-55, HU-10, HU-12, HU-16, LC-23, and MD-20 from the Soil Characterization Laboratory at The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.
