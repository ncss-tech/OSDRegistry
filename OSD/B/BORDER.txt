BORDER SERIES

The Border series includes light-colored Noncalcic Brown gravelly soils occupying terraces, alluvial fans and footslopes.  The soils have formed under comparatively low rainfall and grass and sagebrush cover.  In position and mode of formation they resemble the Aspen soils but may be distinguished by their lack of lime, heavier textured more compact upper subsoils, and less porous substrata.  They differ from the Avon soils, which also occupy fans and footslopes, in being characteristically noncalareous and in the much higher proportion of gravel and cobbles and much lower proportion of fine material in subsoils and substrata.  They are similar to the Hobble soils (tentative series) of the Provo-Goshen Valley Area, Utah.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Border gravelly clay loam.

     1--0 to 8 inches; brownish-gray or weak-brown gravelly clay loam, the gravel mainly subangular fragments of sandstone.  Range in thickness about 8".

     2--8 to 18 inches; medium-brown, moderately compact gravelly clay loam.  Range in thickness about 10".

     3--18 inches +; similar colored compact gravelly clay loam with moderate brown cast, becoming more stony with depth.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The content of gravel varies.  In places where limestone fragments occur the subsoil is somewhat calcareous.  The profile varies somewhat with the character of the included gravel.  The substratum below 3 feet may contain very little fine material.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gently sloping alluvial fans, footslopes, and terraces.  Frequently the soils lie at the outlets of canyons issuing from areas of sandstone.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Good to excessive.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Areas in Idaho are used with indifferent results for dryland wheat and alfalfa.  A somewhat greater acreage along the border in Wyoming is in native grass pasture.  Grass and sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho and western Wyoming.

TYPE LOCATION:  On state line about 1 mile north of Border, Bear Lake County, Idaho.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Bear Lake Soil Conservation District, 1940.

REMARKS:  This soil is somewhat similar to the Hobble soils of the Provo-Goshen Valley Area, Utah.  Correlation should be considered.
