BASTIAN SERIES

The Bastian series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Bastian soils are on floodplains or toe slopes of fan piedmonts and alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Oxyaquic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bastian silt loam--pasture.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 15 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few medium and coarse saltgrass rhizomes; few fine interstitial pores; violently effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2) clear smooth boundary.

    Cq3--94 to 127 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive with about 80 percent brittle, medium subangular blocky aggregates that appear to be weakly cemented by silica; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few to common, fine and very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); clear smooth boundary.  (25 to 38 cm thick)

    C'--127 to 152 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Lincoln County, Nevada.  East of the Bastian farm house and 0.4 mile south of the junction between U.S. Highway 93 and Nevada Highway 25; about 1,250 feet north and 2,130 feet east of the southwest corner of section 11, T.5S., R.60E.,.; USGS Hiko 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 37 degrees 31 minutes 30 seconds N and longitude 115 degrees 13 minutes 20 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 37.5250000 latitude, -115.2222222 longitude. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Soil moisture: Usually saturated in some horizon between 50 and 100 cm for at least 1 month during most years.  
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 15 degrees C.  
Depth to the Cq horizons: 25 to 66 cm, and from 25 to 100 cm in thickness.  
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.

Cq horizon
Hue 10YR or 2.5Y
Texture: Averages silt loam or very fine sandy loam with possible stratification of loam, fine sandy loam, or silty clay loam.  
Salinity (EC): 4 to 32.
Sodicity (SAR): 13 to 30.
Durinodes: 20 to 90 percent that are subangular in shape.  These are very hard or hard when dry and firm or friable when moist.  In all cases they are brittle when wet.  
Soil matrix material between the durinodes: Slightly hard or hard dry and friable or very friable moist.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Mikett, Parohtog, Rustigate and Umbo series. 

Mikett, Parohtog, Rustigate and Umbo series lack silica cementation.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The soils occupy the smooth outer flanks of flood plains and toe slopes of fans where the slope gradient is 0 to 2 percent.  They have developed in loamy alluvium from mixed rock sources that are predominantly ignimbrite and dacite, together with some silty Teriary lake beds, dolomite and limestone.  Bastian soils occur at elevations of 1,158 to 1,280 meters. Mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm.  The mean annual air temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C.  The frost free season is 160 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Basitian soils occur in the same general area as Ash Springs, Geer, Maynard Lake, and Pahranagat.  Ash Springs soils have calcic horizons.  Geer soils are coarse-loamy and lack durinodes.  Maynard Lake soils are sandy.  Pahranagat soils have mollic epipedons and have fine-silty particle-size control sections.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; runoff is very slow; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  The water table fluctuates between 90 to 150 cm, being highest during the winter months.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing.  Plants cover about 40 percent of the soil surface and consists predominantly of inland saltgrass and alkali sacaton.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-eastern Nevada, MLRA 29. The soil is inextensive with about 474 acres mapped.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lincoln County, Nevada, 1996.

REMARKS:  These soils were formerly classified as Alluvial soils.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (A and part of the C horizons).
Durinodes - The zone from 41 to 127 cm (Cq1, Cq2 and Cq3 horizons).
Endosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 90 and 152 cm for some time during normal years.
Particle size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (C, Cq1, Cq2 and part of the A and Cq3 horizons).

ADDITIONAL DATA: During the updates the amount and hardness of durinodes should be verified to determine the amount of rock fragments and if skeletal.
