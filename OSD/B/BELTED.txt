BELTED SERIES

The Belted series consists of shallow and very shallow over a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Belted soils are on fan remnants and fan skirts.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is 6 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Deppy, Dobel, Orphant, and Vylach series.

Deppy soils have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 9 degrees C.  Dobel soils have mean annual soil temperature of 9 to 11 degrees C. and have identifiable secondary carbonates in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Orphant soils are neutral or slightly alkaline in the upper part of the solum and have a second duripan at a depth of 86 to 100 cm.  Vylach soils have bedrock at a depth of 50 to 76 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Belted soils are on fan remnants and fan skirts.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. Elevations range from 1,060 to 2,070 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 9 to 14 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 130 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Fang, Papoose, and Stumble soils.  Fang and Papoose soils do not have duripans.  Stumble soils are sandy and do not have duripans.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Belted soils are used for livestock grazing.  The vegetation is shadscale, gray molly kochia, Nuttall's saltbush, and annuals, dominantly Eriogonum.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 29.
