BEEOX SERIES

The Beeox series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources that are thinly mantled by loess and volcanic ash.  The Beeox soils are on fan piedmonts. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Dorper and Oxcorel series. Dorper and Oxcorel lack Bq horizons with silica accumulations over natric horizons. Dorper soils have subhorizons with 40 to 75 percent rock fragments directly underlying the natric horizon.  Oxcorel soils also have very gravelly textures immediately below the natric horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Beeox soils are on fan piedmonts and fan remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources that are thinly mantled by loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 1,280 to 1,680 meters.  The climate is cool, arid with hot, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 10.0 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Oxcorel and the Golconda and Sodhouse series.  Golconda soils have a strongly silica cemented duripan at depths of 50 to 100 cm.  Sodhouse soils are shallow to a duripan and lack a natric horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained; slow or medium runoff; low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly shadscale and bottlebrush squirreltail with a few scattered spiny hopsage and bud sagebrush plants.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 24.
