BEANLAKE SERIES 

The Beanlake series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till or alluvium.  These soils are on moraines, till plains, alluvial fans, stream terraces and escarpments.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Calciustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Beanlake stony loam, in native grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

(5 to 8 inches thick) 

    Bk--6 to 16 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium and fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 5 percent pebbles, 5 percent cobbles; disseminated lime, common fine masses and seams of lime; continuous faint lime casts on undersides of fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual smooth boundary. (5 to 15 inches thick) 

    Bky1--16 to 38 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 5 percent cobble-sized soft sandstone fragments, 5 percent pebbles, 5 percent cobbles; disseminated lime, common fine masses and seams of lime; continuous faint lime coatings and casts on undersides of fragments; common fine seams of gypsum; violently effervescent; common fine seams of gypsum; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual smooth boundary. (15 to 22 inches thick) 

    Bky2--38 to 60 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) cobbly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 15 percent pebbles, 20 percent cobbles; disseminated lime, few fine masses and seams of lime; continuous faint lime casts on undersides of fragments; common fine seams and masses of gypsum; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT0267, MT1320, MT1395. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the surface to 7 inches (mixed) (A horizon); calcic horizon from 6 to 38 inches (Bk and Bky1 horizons); horzons of gypsum accumulation from 16 to 60 inches (Bky1 and Bky2 horizons); particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bk, Bky1 and Bky2 horizons).    Beanlake soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
