BOERNE SERIES

The Boerne series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapid to moderately permeable, calcareous soils that formed in calcareous loamy alluvium derived from limestone.  The soils are on nearly level to gently sloping flood plains and low stream terraces on dissected plateaus. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 18.9 degrees C (66 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, carbonatic, thermic Fluventic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Boerne fine sandy loam, on a 2 percent slope in pasture.
     (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Ap--0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; slightly sticky; common fine and medium roots; common fine and medium pores; few insect burrows; few fine carbonate concretions; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  Thickness is 10 to 43 cm (4 to 17 in).

    Bk1--20 to 117 cm (8 to 46 in); pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky; common fine and few medium roots; common fine threads of calcium carbonate; many fine and medium pores; many insect burrows and casts; few horizontal discontinuous lenses of rounded water worn limestone pebbles 1/2 to 1 inch in diameter; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  Combined thickness of the Bk horizon is 61 to 147 cm (24 to 58 in).

    Bk2--117 to 157 cm (46 to 62 in); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky; many fine threads and soft masses of calcium carbonates; few thin discontinuous strata that are more sandy, or more clayey, and have 2 percent pebbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline.
