BARDEN SERIES

The Barden series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in a mantle of loess or other silty material and residuum from shale of Pennsylvanian age.  These soils are on ridges and upland side slopes. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1020 mm (40 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (60 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, thermic Aquollic Hapludalfs

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Liberal and Moyers series.
Liberal: are 40 to 60 inches to shale bedrock 
Moyers: are 40 to 60 inches to shale bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Barden soils are ridges and side slopes. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. The soils formed in a mantle of loess or other silty material and residuum from shale of Pennsylvanian age. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 940 to 1067 mm (37 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 15 to 16.6 degrees C (59 to 62 degrees F). Elevation is 210 to 385 meters (689 to 1263 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Barco, Coweta, Deepwater, Hartwell, Medoc, Opolis, Parsons, Sylvania and Zaar soils.
Barco soils are moderately deep and have less clay and occur on the ridgetop.
Coweta soils are shallow to bedrock and occur on smooth upland ridges.
Deepwater soils are in the fine-silty particle size family and occur on upland ridges.
Hartwell soils have an abrupt textural boundary and occur on similar positions.
Medoc soils have an abrupt textural boundary and are somewhat poorly drained occurring on smooth plains.
Opolis soils have an abrupt textural boundary and occur on smooth plains.
Parsons soils have an abrupt textural boundary and occur on upland plains.
Sylvania soils are deep and have lower base saturation in the argillic.
Zaar soils do not have an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained.  Potential for surface runoff is medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high (4 to 14 micrometers per second) in the upper part and moderately low (.4 to 1.4 micrometers per second) in the lower part.  Permeability is slow.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for cultivated crops or hay and pasture.  Native vegetation is tall grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  MLRAs 112, 116A and 116B of southwest and west central Missouri. The type location is in MLRA 112.  The soils are of large extent.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section: The zone from 46 cm to 97 cm (18 to 38 inches).
Mollic epipedon: The zone from o to 28 cm (0 to 11 inches).  (A horizons)
Argillic horizon: The zone from 46 to 142 cm (18 to 56 inches).  (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)
Lithologic discontinuity: At the upper boundary of the 2Bt horizon. 

The soil is not a mollisol because of base saturation in the argillic horizon is less than 50 percent. The original description did not include a lithologic discontinuity between the loess and shale. This has been updated to reflect the discontinuity.  There is a potential of several lithological discontinuities.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
