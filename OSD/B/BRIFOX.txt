BRIFOX SERIES

The Brifox series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in lacustrine sediments from limestone, quartzite, sandstone, and tuff. They are on hills and terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent.  Permeability is very slow.  Average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Chromic Calcixererts

TYPICAL PEDON: Brifox silty clay loam, irrigated cropland; on a 27 percent slope at 5,200 feet elevation.  When described on May, 24 1988, the soil was moist below 8 inches.  (Color is for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(8 to 28 inches thick)

    Bkss4--40 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silty clay, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium and coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and coarse angular blocky; common sphenoidal peds inclined at 20 to 40 degrees; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common intersecting slickensides; cracks 0.25 to 0.5 inches wide and about 1.5 feet apart in the upper 10 inches; common fine violently effervescent, irregularly shaped soft lime masses and filaments; violently effervescent (25 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Brifox soils are on hills, lake terraces and plateaus. Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent.  Elevations range from 4,900 to 7,200 feet.  The soil formed in lacustrine sediments from limestone, quartzite, sandstone, and tuff.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 18 inches, the average annual air temperature is 38 to 43 degrees F and the frost free season is 60 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Iphil (T), Kucera, Lanoak, Niter (T), Rexburg, Ririe and Watercanyon series.  All of the above soils, except Watercanyon, have mollic epipedons.  Iphil, Kucera, Rexburg, Ririe and Watercanyon soils have a coarse-silty particle-size control section.  Kucera and Lanoak soils are pachic and Lanoak has a fine-silty particle-size control section.  Iphil, Ririe and Watercanyon soils are on convex positions on hillslopes.  Kucera and Lanoak soils are in concave positions on hillslopes.  Niter soils are on smooth to slightly concave toeslopes and hillslopes.  Rexburg soils are on less sloping areas on hilltops and footslopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to very rapid runoff; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Brifox soils are used for nonirrigated and irrigated cropland.  Typical crops consist of small grains and alfalfa.  The potential natural vegetation is basin big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass and sod-forming grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho.  The soils of this series are not extensive.
