BROCKO SERIES 

The Brocko series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian materials, alluvium and lake sediments.  These soils are on hills, stream terraces, alluvial fans and lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Calciustepts 

TYPICAL PEDON: Brocko silt loam, cultivated (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Ap--0 to 7 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 8 inches thick) 

    Bk1--7 to 28 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine tubular pores; common fine seams and masses of calcium carbonate; disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary. (7 to 30 inches thick) 

    Bk2--28 to 44 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine tubular pores; common fine seams and masses of calcium carbonate; disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 25 inches thick) 

    Bky--44 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine masses of calcium carbonate; disseminated calcium carbonate; few masses and filaments of gypsum crystals; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9).

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Broadwater County Area, Montana, 1971. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 7 inches (Ap horizon)
Calcic horizon - from 7 to 60 inches (Bk1, Bk2 and Bky horizons)
Accumulation of gypsum - from 44 to 60 inches (Bky horizon)
Particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (part of Bk1 and part of Bk2 horizons).
