BENDAVIS SERIES 

The Bendavis series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils on uplands.  They formed in gravelly hillslope sediments, gravelly colluvium, or gravelly residuum weathered from chert bedrock.  These soils are on gently sloping to very steep upland ridgetops and side slopes.  Slopes range from 1 to 50 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 55 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, siliceous, active, mesic Typic Hapludults 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bendavis gravelly silt loam - on a convex 6 percent slope in a fescue pasture at an elevation of 1,470 feet.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

   Ap--0 to 9 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) gravelly silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; strong coarse granular structure parting to moderate medium granular; very friable; many fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 20 percent chert gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 10 inches thick) 

   BA--9 to 14 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) and dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) silt loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; very friable; many fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 10 percent chert gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 8 inches thick) 

   Bt1--14 to 20 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) gravelly silt loam; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine roots; common fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds: 15 percent chert gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. 

   Bt2--20 to 27 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) very gravelly silty clay loam; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; common fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; 40 percent chert gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. 

   Bt3--27 to 34 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) and pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly silty clay loam; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots; common fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; 50 percent chert gravel; many fine iron-manganese concretions; moderately acid (pH 5.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 12 to 30 inches) 

   2R--34 inches; chert 

TYPE LOCATION:  Texas County, Missouri; about 4 miles northwest of Cabool; 2,400 feet east and 2,400 feet south of the northwest corner of Sec. 36, T. 29 N., R. 12 W.; USGS Cabool NW quadrangle; latitude 37 degrees 9 minutes 14 seconds N., and longitude 92 degrees 12 minutes 16 seconds W. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The particle size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent rock fragments. 

The A horizon has value of 2 to 5 and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silt loam or its gravelly to extremely gravelly analogues.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to neutral. Rock fragments range from 10 to 70 percent. 

Some pedons have an E horizon that has value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture and reaction are similar to the A horizon. 

The Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is the cobbly to extremely cobbly or gravelly to extremely gravelly analogues of silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  Reaction is extremely acid to moderately acid. 

The 2Bt horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 6.  It is extremely cobbly silt loam.  Reaction is very strongly acid. 

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bender, Grimsley, Joppa, Lostcove, Oriskany, and Pocono series.  Bender soils have more than 30 percent fine sand or coarser in the Bt horizon.  Grimsley, Joppa, Lostcove, Oriskany, and Pocono soils are more than 40 inches deep to a lithic or paralithic contact. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bendavis soils are on gently sloping to very steep upland ridgetops and side slopes.  These soils formed in gravelly hillslope sediments, gravelly colluvium, or gravelly residuum from chert bedrock. Slopes range from 1 to 50 percent.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Coulstone, Poynor, Tonti, and Viburnum soils.  Coulstone and Poynor soils are very deep and are on dissected side slopes adjacent to the Bendavis soils.  Tonti and Viburnum soils are very deep and are on higher broader ridgetops.  In addition, Tonti soils have a fragipan. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Runoff is low to high.  Permeability is moderate, and the saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. The layer directly above bedrock is saturated with water for very brief to brief periods in late winter or early spring in most years. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  This soil is used mainly for hay and pasture. Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The Ozark Highland region (MLRA 116A) of southern Missouri and possibly northern Arkansas.  The series is of large extent.
