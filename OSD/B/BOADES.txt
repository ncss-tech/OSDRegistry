BOADES SERIES

The Boades series consists of shallow to soft bedrock, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from bedded shale and sandstone. Boades soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes are 5 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic, shallow Entic Haploxerolls
 
TYPICAL PEDON: Boades loam, on a mountain side at an elevation of 1155 feet. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A1--0 to 2 inches (0 to 5 centimeters); brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine through medium roots; common very fine through medium tubular pores; 10 percent fine and medium subangular gravel; 10 percent fine subangular soft pararock fragments; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary.

    A2--2 to 14 inches (5 to 35 centimeters); brown (10YR 5/3) loam; dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine through medium roots; many very fine through medium tubular pores; 10 percent fine and medium subangular gravel; 10 percent fine subangular soft pararock fragments; moderately acid (pH 5.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of A horizons is 10 to 20 inches)

    Cr--14 to 60 inches (35 to 150 centimeters); highly fractured, bedded, weathered shale with fractures 1 to 2 inches apart, and with about 10 to 15 percent soil in fractures with common very fine roots.

TYPE LOCATION: Ventura County, California; about 1/2 mile northwest of Laguna Peak in an unsectionalized area; Latitude 34 degrees, 6 minutes, 12 seconds north and Longitude 119 degrees, 3 minutes, 52 seconds west; Point Mugu Quadrangle.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Mean annual soil temperature: 62 to 66 degrees F.
Soil moisture: Soil is moist in middle to late November to late May.
Depth to soft rock: 10 to 20 inches (25 to 50 centimeters).
Reaction: Slightly acid or moderately acid.
Organic matter content: 2 to 4 percent.

A horizon--10YR 5/2, 5/3 and 10YR 3/2, 3/3 moist.
Texture--Loam or clay loam in the upper part and clay loam, loam or gravelly loam in the lower part.
Clay percentage--18 to 35 percent.
Coarse fragments--5 to 10 percent in the upper part and 10 to 30 percent in the lower part.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bonnydoon, Caperton, Cotharin (T) and Mipolomol series. Bonnydoon soils are somewhat excessively drained. Caperton soils have less than 18 percent clay in the solum and Cr horizons comprised of quartz diorite. Cotharin and Mipolomol soils have Cr horizons comprised of volcanic rock and are neutral throughout.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Boades soils are on side slopes of hills and mountains. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from bedded shale and sandstone. Slopes are 5 to 75 percent. Elevations are 10 to 1570 feet. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches, the mean annual temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F., and the frost free season is to 290 to 350 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chumash (T) and Malibu (T) soils.  Chumash soils lack a mollic epipedon and Malibu soils are greater than 20 inches to bedrock. Both these soils are on side slopes of hills and mountains. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; very low to medium runoff; moderate to moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Wildlife habitat, recreation, cattle production and building site development. Vegetation is California sagebrush, purple sage, white sage, black sage, buckwheat, golden bush and deerweed.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Ventura County and Los Angeles County, California. The soil is moderately extensive. MLRA 20.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California.

SERIES PROPOSED: Ventura County, California,  1999.

REMARKS: The series name is coined. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:

Mollic epipedon--The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 14 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).

Paralithic material--The zone from a depth of 14 inches to about 60 inches (Cr horizon)
