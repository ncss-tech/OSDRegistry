BUCKLEBAR SERIES

The Bucklebar series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  Bucklebar soils are on fan terraces and coalescent fan piedmonts that have slopes of 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 67 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bucklebar sandy loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    A--0 to 2 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium and thin platy structure; soft, few roots; few thin (less than 1mm.) lenses, redder than above; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 3 inches thick) 

    Bt1--2 to 6 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; hard; few fine roots; few fine tubular pores; with smooth-appearing sides; sand grains and gravel coated with clay; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick) 

    Bt2--6 to 15 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) sandy clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure, parting to weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard; few fine roots; few fine tubular pores; sand grains and gravel coated with clay; 5 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 19 inches thick)

    Btk--15 to 25 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) sandy clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak coarse subangular blocky; very hard; few fine roots; sand grains and gravel coated with silicate clay; 10 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; discontinuous calcium carbonate coatings on some peds and gravel; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.  (9 to 20 inches thick) 

    Bk1--25 to 38 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; few pinkish white (5YR 8/2) carbonate nodules, pink (5YR 7/3) moist weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard; few fine roots; few fine pores; 5 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; some pores have calcium carbonate coatings on walls; effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 15 inches thick) 

    Bk2--38 to 60 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) silty clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard; 3 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; calcium carbonate on some surfaces of peds and on walls of pores and channels; effervescent; moderately alkaline. 

TYPE LOCATION:  Dona Ana County, New Mexico; west bank of gully, about 0.1 mile south of Highway #70; in the NE 1/4 of section 18, T. 22 S., R. 3 E.; 106 degrees, 40 minutes, 03 seconds west longitude; 32 degrees, 23 minutes, 58 seconds north latitude. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture: Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during December through February and for more than 20 days cumulative during July through September.  Driest during May and June.  The soil moisture regime is Typic aridic.

Soil temperature: 59 to 72 degrees F.

Depth to the base of the Bt:  ranges from 20 to 40 inches, with some extending to 50 inches 

Calcium carbonate accumulation:  less than 40 inches.  3 to 8 percent calcium carbonate equivalent, ranging to 15 percent as few filaments or coatings to scattered nodules

Rock fragments:  less than 20 percent

COMPETING SERIES:  These are Anway (AZ), Avenal (CA), Bryman (CA), Contactmine (T)(CA), Dutchflat (AZ), Garlock (CA), Hi Vista (CA), Milham (CA), Neuralia (CA), and Palomas (NM) series.  Anway soils are less than 20 inches deep to the base of the Bt horizon.  Avenal, Bryman, Dutchflat, Garlock, Hi Vista and Neuralia soils are in the Mohave Desert and are moist in the soil moisture control section for less than 20 days cumulative during July to September.  Palomas soils have a cambic horizon above the argillic and have calcium carbonate accumulations below 50 inches.  No description available in the database for Contactmine.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bucklebar soils are most common on alluvial fans, fan terraces, and coalescing fan piedmonts.  Slopes are usually 1 to 2 percent and range from 0 to 10 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 7 to 12 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 57 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Cacique, Cruces, Jal, Hayhook, Onite, Stellar and Dona Ana series. Cacique and Cruces soils have petrocalcic horizons.  Jal and Hayhook soils do not have argillic horizons.  Onite soils are coarse-loamy.  Stellar soils have clay loam or clay argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation is mainly mesquite, tobosa, tarbush, and snakeweed. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern New Mexico and Arizona.  The series is of moderate extent.  MLRA is 40, 41 and 42.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Dona Ana County (Desert Soil Geomorphology Project), New Mexico; 1973.

REMARKS:

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 2 inches (A horizon)

Argillic horizon - the zone from 2 to 25 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Btk horizons)

Secondary carbonates - the zone from 25 to 60 inches  (Btk, Bk1, and Bk2 horizons)

This series represents an identified soil within the Desert Soil-Geomorphology Project, Las Cruces, New Mexico.  The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment.  The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.  Revision outside the project area is discouraged in order to preserve the historical concept for research.

Classified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Data from pedon S59(61)NMex-7-7 (L.H. Gile and R. B. Grossman. 1979.  The Desert Project Soil Monograph. Document PB80-135304. National Technical Information Service, Springfield, VA.) support this classification.  The typical pedon is similar to and only a few feet away from the sampled pedon.
