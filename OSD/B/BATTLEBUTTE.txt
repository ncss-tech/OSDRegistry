BATTLEBUTTE SERIES

The Battlebutte series consists of shallow, well drained soils.  They are 10 to 20 inches deep over welded tuff.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from semiconsolidated welded tuff.  These soils are on dissected hills.  Slopes are 4 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy, mixed, active, frigid, shallow Typic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Battlebutte gravelly loam, rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A1--0 to 2 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) gravelly loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; common very fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.

    A2--2 to 8 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) gravelly loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; common very fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (Combined A horizons--7 to 11 inches thick.)

    Bw1--8 to 13 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, and few medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel, 10 percent paragravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw2--13 to 19 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist, massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; 20 percent gravel, 50 percent paragravel; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 8 inches thick)

    Cr--19 inches; semiconsolidated welded tuff.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - dissected hills.
Slope - 4 to 80 percent.
Elevation - 2,900 to 4,400 feet.
Parent material - colluvium and residuum derived from semiconsolidated welded tuff.
Climate - cold winters; moist springs; hot, dry summers. 
Mean annual precipitation - 15 to 22 inches, most of which falls as rain or snow in late fall through late spring. 
Mean annual temperature - 39 to 46 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 75 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, moderate to rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Battlebutte soils are used for range, pasture, and woodland.  The potential native plant community is mainly rough fescue, Idaho fescue, Bluebunch wheatgrass, forbs, and shrubs.  Woodland areas are dominated by a ponderosa pine overstory and a bunchgrass understory.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Battlebutte soils are of limited extent in the north end of Hotsprings Valley of northwestern Montana.  MLRA 43A.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Sanders County, Montana, 1997.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT1218.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 13 inches (A and Bw1 horizons); a cambic horizon from 13 to 19 inches (Bw2 horizon); a paralithic contact at a depth of 19 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).  Battlebutte soils have a xeric moisture regime and a frigid temperature regime.
