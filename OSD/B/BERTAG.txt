BERTAG SERIES

The Bertag series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from tuffaceous sandstone and tuffaceous limestone.  They are on foothill slopes. The mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Pachic Ultic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bertag silt loam, rangeland. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 5 cm; matted decaying leaves and twigs.

    A1--5 to 33 cm; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium and few coarse roots; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual smooth boundary. (10 to 33 cm thick)

    A2--33 to 66 cm, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure that parts to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium and few coarse roots; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 41 cm thick)

    Bt1--66 to 94 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few fine medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine pores; common thin clay films; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual irregular boundary.

    Bt2--94 to 137 cm; very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) heavy silty clay loam, light grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, sticky and very plastic; few fine medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine pores; many thin clay films; moderately acid (pH 5.8); diffuse irregular boundary. (Combined thickness of Bt1 and Bt2 horizons - 30 to 80 cm)

    Bt3--137 to 157 cm; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) heavy silt clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, sticky and very plastic; few fine and medium roots; common fine pores; common thin clay films; moderately acid (pH 6.0).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Broadhead, Coburg, Cristo, Dixonville, Donner, Hankins, Henefer, Malabon, Silverton and Top series. Broadhead, Cristo and Henefer soils have base saturation of less than 75 percent in the upper 76 cm. Coburg, Dixonville, Malabon and Silverton soils have mesic temperature and mixed mineralogy. Dixonville and Silverton soils also have bedrock at depths of 50 to 100 cm. Donner soils have a paralithic contact with bedrock at depths of 50 to 100 cm and have mollic epipedons less than 50 cm thick. Hankins soils average 45 to 60 percent clay in the Bt horizon and have 2C horizons of very hard clayey sediments. Top soils have solums less than 100 cm thick.
