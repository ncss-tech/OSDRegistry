BAXTON SERIES 

The Baxton series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium, slope alluvium, or residuum from coarse grained igneous rocks. They are on mountain slopes, hills and ridges. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 432 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Baxton coarse sandy loam, in rangeland (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

     A--0 to 28 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) coarse sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine and very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and few fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine pores; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (25 to 36 cm thick) 

     Bw1--28 to 56 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and few fine, medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine pores; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (25 to 61 cm thick) 

     Bw2--56 to 79 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly coarse sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine, medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine pores; 30 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.3); clear wavy boundary. (combined thickness of Bw horizons is 45 to 75 cm thick) 

     Cr--79 to 145 cm; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) disintegrated granite bedrock (grus) that crushes to very gravelly loamy coarse sand. (8 to 71 cm thick) 

     R--145 cm; hard granite bedrock.

USE AND VEGETATION: Baxton soils are used mainly for rangeland, wildlife habitat and watershed. The native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, rough fescue, western yarrow, lupine, big sagebrush and Rocky Mountain juniper. Areas with forest canopy cover have an overstory of Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine and an understory of Rocky Mountain juniper, big sagebrush, Idaho fescue, and rough fescue. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Baxton soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana. MLRA 43B.
