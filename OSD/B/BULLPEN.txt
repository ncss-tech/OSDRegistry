BULLPEN SERIES

The Bullpen series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from shale and sandstone.  Bullpen soils are on toeslopes and footslopes of hills.  Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bullpen parachannery loam, on a northwest facing, 6 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 6,400 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The surface is covered by 35 percent channers.

    A--0 to 3 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) parachannery loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium and fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; 25 percent parachanners; slightly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick)

    Bk1--3 to 8 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) parachannery loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, few medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 25 percent parachanners; strongly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated and segregated as less than 1 mm thick coatings on undersides of pararock fragments; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary.

    Bk2--8 to 26 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) parachannery loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 20 percent parachanners; strongly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated and segregated as less than 1 mm thick coatings on undersides of pararock fragments; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt smooth boundary.

    Bk3--26 to 34 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) parachannery clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 20 percent parachanners; strongly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated and segregated as less than 1 mm thick coatings on undersides of pararock fragments; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2); abrupt smooth boundary.

    Bk4--34 to 46 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) parachannery clay loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few medium and fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 30 percent channers; strongly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; and segregated as less than 1 mm thick coatings on undersides of pararock fragments very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the Bk horizons 38 to 56 inches)

    Cr--46 inches; shale bedrock with fractures less than 4 inches apart.

TYPE LOCATION:  Uintah County, Utah; about 3 miles southeast of Rainbow, Utah; located about 700 feet east and 900 feet south of the northwest corner of sec. 7, T. 12 S., R. 25 E., SLBM; Rainbow, Utah USGS quad; lat. 39 degrees 47 minutes 39 seconds N. and long. 109 degrees 10 minutes 1 seconds W., NAD 27

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture:  The moisture control section is affected by precipitation that falls evenly through the year with a slight increase in late summer and early fall.  Aridic moisture regime bordering on ustic.
Mean annual soil temperature:  47 to 51 degrees F.
Depth to paralithic contact:  40 to 60 inches to weathered shale or sandstone

Particle-size control section:  18 to 27 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent pararock fragments (predominantly parachanners from shale and sandstone).

A horizon:
Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma:  2 to 4 dry or moist
Reaction:  moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline

Bk1 and Bk2 (upper part) horizons:
Hue:  10YR or 2.5YR

Chroma:  3 or 4 dry or moist
Pararock fragments:  15 to 35 percent parachanners
Gypsum:  0 to 2 percent
Reaction:  moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline

Bk3 and Bk4 (lower part) horizons:
Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y
Value:  6 to 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist
Chroma:  2 to 4 dry or moist
Texture:  parachannery loam, parachannery clay loam, parachannery silt loam
Pararock fragments:  15 to 35 percent parachanners
Other fragments:  5 to 40 percent soft shale fragments that slake in water
Gypsum:  0 to 3 percent
Reaction:  moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Aquima, La Fonda, and Zigweid series.  All these soils are very deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from shale and sandstone
Landform:  toeslopes and footslopes of hills
Slopes:  2 to 40 percent
Elevation: 5,400 to 6,800 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  45 to 49 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  8 to 12 inches
Frost-free period:  110 to 140 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Gerst, Hanksville, Mikim, Polychrome, and Walknolls series.  

Gerst and Walknolls soils occur on hillslopes and are shallow to bedrock.

Hanksville soils occur on hillslopes and have a fine particle-size control section.

Mikim soils occur on alluvial flats and are very deep.

Polychrome soils occur on hillslopes and have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, low to high runoff, moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally for rangeland, wildlife habitat and recreation.  Potential native vegetation consists of Wyoming big sagebrush, winterfat, Indian ricegrass, galleta, squirreltail and needleandthread.  This soil has been correlated to the Semidesert Loam (Wyoming Big Sagebrush) - 034XY212UT range site at the type location in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Utah.  LRR D, MLRA 34.  This series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Uintah County, Uintah Area Soil Survey, Utah. 1998.  The name is taken from a nearby geographic location.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (Bk2, Bk3 and Bk4 horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 3 inches.  (A horizon)
Cambic horizon:  The zone from 3 to 26 inches.  (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)
Paralithic contact:  The contact with shale at 46 inches.  (Cr horizon)

The cation exchange activity class was inferred from laboratory data from similar soils in the Uintah Area Soil Survey.

Classification was changed from calcareous, Ustic Torriorthents to Ustic Haplocambids 12/98.
