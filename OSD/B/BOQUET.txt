BOQUET SERIES


The Boquet series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in residual material from herbaceous material overlying mixed alluvium. These soils form in marshes, swales, and flood plains of narrow streams on slopes 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 406 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.   

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Histic Cryaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Boquet mucky peat on 1 percent slope in a wet meadow at an elevation of 1836 meters.   (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise indicated.)

 Oe--0 to 20 cm; black (7.5YR 2.5/1) broken face mucky peat, black (5YR 2.5/1) rubbed; about 15 percent rubbed fibers; few very fine and fine roots and common medium roots; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (20 to 33 cm thick)

 A1--20 to 36 cm; black (7.5YR 2.5/1) mucky silty clay loam, black (10YR 2/1) dry; massive; extremely hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine and common medium roots; many very fine irregular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); abrupt wavy boundary. 

 A2--36 to 55 cm; black (N 2/0) clay, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; massive; extremely hard, firm, moderately sticky and very plastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; common medium  gray (2.5Y 5/1) iron depletions; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); abrupt wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizon is 10 to 35 cm)

 Bg1--55 to 67 cm; greenish gray (10Y 6/1) silty clay loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; massive; extremely hard, firm, moderately sticky and very plastic; few fine roots; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 13 cm thick)

 2Bg2--67 to 108 cm; gray (2.5Y 5/1) gravelly loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) dry; massive; extremely hard, firm, moderately sticky and very plastic; common medium roots; common irregular pores; 30 percent gravel; very slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 41 cm thick)

 2BCg--108 to 153 cm; gray (2.5Y 6/1) very gravelly sandy loam; massive; slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common irregular pores; 45 percent gravel.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the family.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
  Landscape: Outwash plain and alluvial plains
  Landform: Valley floor, marshes, swales, flood plains of narrow streams, and fan remnants,  
  	particularly the lower portion of fan remnants where they have been reworked by streams.  
  Elevation: 1826 to 1847 meters
  Slope: 0 to 1 percent
  Parent material: Herbaceous materials over stratified mixed alluvium
  Mean annual precipitation: 305 to 457 millimeters 
  Mean annual air temperature: 3.3 to 6.7 degrees C
  Frost free period: 20 to 50 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Furniss, Cedron, Tepete, and Zundell soils.  Furniss soils do not have a histic epipedon. Cedron soils have carbonatic mineralogy. Tepete soils are histosols.  Furniss and Tepete are located in adjacent swales and depressions.  Zundell soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on adjacent mounds.

 Drainage class: Very poorly drained 
 Runoff: Negligible

USE AND VEGETATION:
  Major uses: Range and wildlife habitat
  Range/ecological site: R013XY038ID
  Dominant native vegetation: Baltic rush, Nebraska sedge, elk sedge, bulbous bluegrass, tufted hair 
   	grass, redtop, shrubby cinquefoil, and willow
