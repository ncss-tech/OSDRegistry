BODOT SERIES

The Bodot series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived from shale.  Bodot soils are on hillslopes and ridges.  Slopes range from 2 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 8.9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, calcareous, mesic Torrertic Ustorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Bodot clay, in rangeland.  Described on June 14, 1966.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 8 cm; gray (5YR 5/1) clay, dark gray (5YR 4/1) moist; strong fine granular structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 13 cm thick) 

    AB--8 to 15 cm; gray (5YR 5/1) clay, dark gray (5YR 4/1) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); cracks 5 to 10 mm wide common; gradual smooth boundary.  (8 to 30 inches thick) 

    Bkss--15 to 84 cm; gray (5YR 5/1) clay, dark gray (5YR 4/1) moist; strong coarse angular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); cracks 5 to 10 mm wide; common distinct pressure faces; gradual wavy boundary.  (25 to 75 cm thick)

    Cr--84 to 109 cm; soft shale.

COMPETING SERIES:
Vananda (MT) - are very deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform - hillslopes and ridges
Elevation - 1,520 to 2,290 meters
Slope - 2 to 65 percent
Parent material - slope alluvium or colluvium derived from shale
Mean annual precipitation - 330 to 430 mm
Mean annual air temperature - 7.2 to 11.7 degrees C.
Precipitation pattern - Precipitation is evenly distributed throughout the year with July and August being slightly wetter and June being slightly dryer.
Frost-free period - 110 to 130 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: well drained, high or very high runoff, slow or very slow permeability

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for irrigated cropland and rangeland.  Crops are mainly alfalfa, pasture, and small grains.  Native vegetation is big sagebrush, rabbitbrush, Indian ricegrass, western wheatgrass, Junegrass, and scattered pinyon and Utah juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Colorado and adjacent parts of Arizona, Utah, and New Mexico; LRR D, E; MLRA 35, 36, 39, and 48A; large extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: La Plata County Area, Colorado. 1982. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Cracks 5 to 10 mm wide: from 8 to 84 cm (AB, Bkss horizons)
Particle size control section: The zone from 25 to 84 cm. (Bkss horizon)
Series control section: 0 to 109 cm (all horizons and upper 25 cm of the Cr layer)
Cracks seldom reach the surface and slickensides do not intersect.

Bodot soils have a mesic soil temperature regime and are in an ustic soil moisture regime bordering on aridic.
