TAXONOMIC CLASS: Dysic, subgelic Typic Hemistels

TYPICAL PEDON: Bonot peat - on a slope of 1 percent under tussock cottongrass/mixed ericaceous shrub meadow. (All colors are for moist soil)

        Oi--0 to 7 inches (0 to 18 cm); very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/3) peat; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; extremely acid (pH 4.0); clear smooth boundary.

        Oef1--7 to 22 inches (18 to 56 cm); dark reddish brown (5YR 2.5/2) permanently frozen mucky peat; common very fine and fine roots; very strongly acid (pH 4.5); abrupt wavy boundary.

        Cf--22 to 24 inches (56 to 61 cm); yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) permanently frozen silt loam; common very fine and fine roots; very strongly acid (pH 4.6); abrupt wavy boundary.

        Oef2--24 to 60 inches (61 to 152 cm); dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) and dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) permanently frozen mucky peat; common very fine and fine roots; very strongly acid (pH 4.6).

TYPE LOCATION: Delta River Area, Alaska; in the Tangle Lakes area about 3 miles west of Dickey Lake; UTM coordinates: Zone 6, Easting 539902, Northing 6981062.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture class: aquic
Average annual soil temperature: 31 to 30 degrees F. (-0.1 to -1.0 degrees C)
Mean summer soil temperature: 36 to 39 degrees F. (2 to 4 degrees C)
Depth to permafrost: 6 to 13 inches (15 to 33 cm)

Oi horizon:
Color-hue of 5YR to 10YR; value of 2 to 4; chroma of 2 to 4
Organic matter content-65 to 90 percent
Reaction-extremely acid to very strongly acid

Oef horizon:
Color-hue of 5YR to 10YR; value of 2 to 4; chroma of 2 to 4
Organic matter content-65 to 90 percent
Reaction-extremely acid to very strongly acid

COMPETING SERIES: There are the no competing series in this classification.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landforms: turf hummocks on depressions on hills; turf hummocks on depressions on outwash plains
Parent material: grassy organic material
Elevation: 2,848 to 2,999 feet (868 to 914 m)
Slope: 0 to 3 percent
Annual precipitation: 22 to 24 inches (564 to 607 mm)
Annual temperature: 25 degrees F (-4 degrees C)
Frost-free period: 50 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Fels and Shand soils. Fels soils are well drained, shallow to moderately deep to permafrost, and occur on hills. Shand soils are very poorly drained, very deep, and occur on floodplains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained, negligible runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high above the permafrost and very low in the permafrost.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat and recreation. Native vegetation is tussock cottongrass/mixed ericaceous shrub meadow.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 228, Interior Alaska Mountains, Alaska. The series is of small extent.
