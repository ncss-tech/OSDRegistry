BENTFORT SERIES

The Bentfort series consists of very deep, moderately well to well drained soils that formed in stratified alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary materials.  Bentfort soils are on flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 305 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Oxyaquic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bentfort silty clay loam, on a northeast-facing, linear 1 percent slope in a cultivated field, at an elevation of 1248 meters (4086 feet).  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on November 28, 2011 the soil was moist from 0 to 107 cm.  The surface was covered by corn stubble.

(25 to 49 cm thick)

    Bk--38 to 84 cm (15 to 33 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; 1 percent fine, distinct, spherical, non-cemented carbonate masses in matrix, 8 percent calcium carbonate equivalent, strongly effervescent; 1 percent medium, distinct, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) iron masses in the matrix; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (30 to 49 cm thick)

    2C2--107 to 200 cm (42 to 80 inches); brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) loamy sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).  (combined thickness of the 2C horizons is 100 to 139 cm)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cheraw(T), Glenberg, and Bankard series.  The Cheraw soils are fine textured andmoderately well drained.

Occasionally flooded for brief periods during the months of April through August but may occur in any month.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used primarily as irrigated cropland. Principal irrigated crops are, alfalfa, small grains, corn, and truck crop. Native vegetation is dominantly blue grama, alkali sacaton, galleta grass, inland saltgrass, and fourwing saltbush. ESD R069XY030CO: Salt Meadow.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Arkansas River Valley, Colorado; LRR G, MLRA 69 and 67B; the series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES PROPOSED:  Otero County, Colorado; Otero County Soil Survey Area, Colorado.  The name is coined from Bent's Old Fort National Monument.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 150 centimeters (0 to 59 inches).
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 25 to 100 centimeters (10 to 39 inches). (All or part of the Ap, Bk and 2C1 horizons)
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 38 centimeters (0 to 15 inches). (Ap horizon)
Cambic horizon:  The zone from 38 to 84 centimeters (15 to 33 inches). (Bk horizon)
Redoximorphic concentrations: In the zone from 38 to 84 centimeters (15 to 33 inches)  (Bk horizon)
Endosaturation: The zone of saturation from 38 to 200 centimeters (Bk, 2C1, and 2C2 horizons)

Lithologic discontinuity:  At the upper boundary of the Bk and 2C1 horizon.  
Other features:  Ustic aridic moisture regime, mesic temperature regime.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

This soil was previously identified as Rocky Ford, sand substratum phase on flood plains that are occasionally flooded. The Bentfort series will replace that phase in the Arkansas River Valley in Colorado.
