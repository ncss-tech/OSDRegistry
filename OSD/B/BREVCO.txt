06/2016-This official series description was updated as part of the final correlation of the Spokane County, Washington, soil survey. The type location needs to be further investigated and updated. The coordinates do not put the point in a Brevco map unit. The formatting was updated according to SSR1 Technical Note 11--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015).
