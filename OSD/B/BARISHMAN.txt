BARISHMAN SERIES

The Barishman series consists of deep, well to moderately well drained soils that formed in old alluvial sediments from calcareous shales.  Barishman soils are on upland hills and ridges and have slopes of 3 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic Vertic Argicryids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Barishman loam, grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 3 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 4 inches thick)

    A2--3 to 12 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak thin platy structure that parts to moderate fine granules; vesicular; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; slightly acid; abrupt wavy boundary.  (4 to 12 inches thick)

    B21t--12 to 20 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure that parts to medium angular blocks; horizon is slightly hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; peds are extremely hard; thin continuous clay films on peds and in root channels and pores; neutral; gradual wavy boundary.  (5 to 20 inches thick)

    B22t--20 to 36 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) clay, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; weak coarse angular blocky structure; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few thin patchy clay films on peds, and in root channels; visible secondary calcium carbonate as nodules and in thin seams; calcareous; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    B3ca--36 to 44 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) clay, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; weak coarse angular blocky structure; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few thin patchy clay films on peds, and in root channels; visible secondary calcium carbonate as nodules and in thin seams; calcareous; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Cc1--44 to 60 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) clay, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; massive; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky; visible secondary calcium carbonate as nodules and in thin seams and streaks; calcareous, moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Jackson County, Colorado; .3 mile east and 660 feet north of the S 1/4 corner of Sec. 35, T. 9 N., R. 78 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 40 degrees F and mean summer temperature is about 56 degrees F.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 15 to 50 inches but is not shallower than the upper 4 inches of the B2t horizon.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 12 to 50 inches.  Depth to continuous subhorizons of visible secondary carbonate and/or sulfate ranges from 15 to 50 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent and are mainly 1/2 to 10 inches in diameter.

The A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.

The B2t horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically clay but clay ranges from 35 to 50 percent, silt from 15 to 45 percent, and sand from 15 to 45 percent with more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.

The C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  Reaction ranges from moderately to very strongly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent of the fine earth fraction ranges from about 4 to 14 percent.  It is clay or heavy clay loam and has more than 35 percent clay.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Coalmont and Phillips series.  Coalmont soils have a paralithic contact above a depth of 40 inches.  Phillips soils have thinner A2 horizons, continuous A&B horizons, and thick skeletons on the surfaces of peds in the argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Barishman soils are on upland hills and ridges.  Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in old alluvial sediments derived principally from sedimentary rock.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is about 12 inches with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and early summer.  The average annual temperature is 38 degrees F and the average summer temperature is 57 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 35 to 50 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Aaberg and Boettcher soils.  Aaberg soils lack an argillic horizon and have a paralithic contact above a depth of 40 inches.  Boettcher soils lack an abrupt textural boundary between the A and B2t horizons and have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well to moderately well drained; rapid runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally as native rangeland.  Principal native vegetation is sagebrush, wheatgrass, muttongrass and pine needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  High mountain valleys of north-central Colorado.  The series is of small extent.
