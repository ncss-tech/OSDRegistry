BIGHAT SERIES

The Bighat series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Bighat soils are on lake shore terraces and beach terraces.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Appian, Biddleman, and Cakehill series.

Appian soils have nonstony natric horizons and have mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 14 degrees C.  Biddleman soils have mainly gravel in the particle-size control section, do not have stones, and have mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 13 degrees C.  Cakehill soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bighat soils are on lake shore terraces and beach terraces.  They formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,375 to 1,800 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Isolde, Mazuma, and Raglan soils.  Isolde soils are sandy and are on dunes on terraces.  Mazuma soils are coarse-loamy and are on lake terraces.  Raglan soils are fine-loamy and are on lake terraces.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Bighat soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly shadscale, bud sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, and littleleaf horsebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Nevada and northeastern California.  These soils are not extensive with about 6,000 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 23.
