TYPE LOCATION: Sussex County, Delaware; about 400 feet east and 600 feet south of the junction of County Road 264 and the Broadkill River; lat. 38 degrees 48 minutes 02 seconds N. and long. 75 degrees 12 minutes 08 seconds W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth to Bedrock: Greater than 60 inches

Other Features: Many pedons, once exposed, form jarosite mottles.  The n-value to a depth of 40 inches is 0.7 or more.  Below 40 inches it is variable.

RANGE OF INDIVIDUAL HORIZONS:
O horizon:
Color--hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2
Texture--mucky peat or peat (commonly, over 60 percent of the soil volume consists of live roots and stems)

Ag horizon:
Color--hue of 5YR to 5BG, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 2 to 4
Texture--silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay, including the mucky texture modifier
Organic Matter Content: 2 to 12 percent

Cg horizon:
Color--hue of 5YR to 5BG, value of 2 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 2 to 7
Texture (above of 40 inches)--silt loam or silty clay loam and may contain thin lenses of organic or coarse-textured soil materials
Texture (below 40 inches)--silty clay loam, silt loam, loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, or sand

COMPETING SERIES: None

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: Coastal Plain marshes
Landform: Estuarine tidal salt marshes--flooded twice daily by tides and occasionally by storm surges
Elevation: 0 to 2 feet
Parent Material: Loamy marine sediments, high in silt
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 52 to 58 degrees F.
Mean Annual Precipitation: 36 to 55 inches
Frost Free Period: 175 to 200 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Appoquinimink soils--have within 40 inches of the soil surface organic layers more than 8 inches thick, on similar landforms
Boxiron soils--have a histic epipedon, on similar landforms
Pawcatuck soils--organic sols with organic layers 16 to 51 inches thick, underlain by sandy mineral layers, on similar landforms
Transquaking soils--organic sols with organic layers more than 51 inches thick, underlain by loamy mineral layers, on similar landforms
Westbrook soils--organic sols with organic layers 16 to 51 inches thick, underlain by loamy mineral layers, on similar landforms

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
   Drainage Class (Agricultural): Very poorly drained
   Index Surface Runoff: Negligible
   Internal Free Water Occurance: Very shallow; Permanent
   Permeability: Moderate or moderately slow above 40 inches and variable below 40 inches

USE AND VEGETATION:
  Major Uses: Primarily as wetland wildlife--shellfish and small crustacean habitat. Large areas in Delaware have been ditched to provide better drainage for mosquito control. Some areas were previously filled to provide waterfront homesites.
  Dominant Vegetation: The natural vegetation is salt-tolerant wetland species, predominantly salt marsh cordgrass, salt hay, salt wort, and spike grass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
  Distribution: Coastal areas of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey.
  Extent: Moderate

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Worcester County, Maryland, 1995.

REMARKS: Broadkill soils were formerly mapped as Tidal Marsh miscellaneous areas. They become extremely acid when drained.

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Hemic soil materials--the zone from 0 to 6 inches has a fiber content, after rubbing, that is one-sixth to two-fifths of the soil volume
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 13 inches (Oe and Ag horizons)
Peraquic conditions--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 80 inches is continuously saturated (endosaturation).
High n-value--the zone from the surface to 80 inches has n-value greater than 0.7 typically greater than 1.0.
Sulfidic materials--incubated samples, to a depth of 80 inches, show a drop in pH of 0.5 or more units to a pH value of 4.0 or less within 8 weeks
