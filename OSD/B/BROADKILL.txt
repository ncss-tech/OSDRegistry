COMPETING SERIES: There are no known competing series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent Material--Fine-silty estuarine deposits
Landscape--Coastal estuaries, coastal lowlands, and tidal rivers 
Landform--Coastal and estuarine salt or brackish tidal marshes 
Elevation--0 to 1 meters
Mean Annual Air Temperature--11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F)
Mean Annual Precipitation--914 to 1397 millimeters (36 to 55 inches)
Frost Free Period--175 to 200 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Appoquinimink, Boxiron, Mispillion, Pawcatuck, and Transquaking soils.
Appoquinimink soils--Have a buried organic layer more than 40 centimeters thick within 200 centimeters of the mineral soil surface, on similar landforms
Boxiron soils--Have a histic epipedon, on similar landforms
Mispillion soils--Have organic layers 40 to 130 centimeters thick, underlain by loamy mineral layers, on similar landforms
Pawcatuck soils--Have organic layers 40 to 130 centimeters thick, underlain by sandy mineral layers, on similar landforms
Transquaking soils--Have organic layers more than 130 centimeters thick, underlain by loamy mineral layers, on slightly lower elevations in the marsh.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage Class--Very poorly drained
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity--High to moderately high above 100 centimeters and variable below 100 centimeters
Soil moisture regime--Peraquic
Flooding--Very frequent, for very brief durations (flooded by salt or brackish tidal waters twice daily and during significant coastal storm events)

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses--Primarily as wetland wildlife habitat including shellfish and small crustaceans. Large areas in Delaware and Maryland have been ditched to provide better drainage for mosquito control but have led to marsh degradation and erosion in some areas. Some areas were previously filled to provide waterfront homesites.
Natural Vegetation--Salt-tolerant wetland species, predominantly salt marsh cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora), salt hay (Spartina patens), salt wort (Salicornia sp.), and spike grass (Distichlis spicata).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
General area--Tidal marshes along the landward side of barrier island lagoons and along tidally influenced rivers and bays in Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey.
Land Resource Regions--T - Atlantic and Gulf Coast Lowland Forest and Crop Region
MLRA(s)--149A, 153C, 153D
Extent--Moderate

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Special Projects Region

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Worcester County, Maryland, 1995.

REMARKS: Broadkill soils were formerly mapped as Tidal Marsh miscellaneous areas. They become extremely acid to ultra-acid when drained.

Carbon stock and carbon density ranges are not primary criteria for defining this series.

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Hemic soil materials--The zone from 0 to 15 centimeters (Oese horizon) 
Ochric epipedon--The zone from 0 to 33 centimeters (Oese and Aseg horizons)
Peraquic conditions--The zone from the soil surface to a depth of 200 centimeters is continuously saturated (endosaturation)
High n-value--The zone from the surface to 200 centimeters has a slightly fluid to very fluid manner of failure.
Hypersulfidic materials--The zone from 0 to 33 centimeters (Oese and Aseg horizons)
