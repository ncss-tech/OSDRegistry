BUKREEK SERIES

The Bukreek series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium of Quaternary age. These soils occur on very gently sloping terraces on dissected plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 610mm (24 in) and mean annual temperature is about 17.2 degrees C (63 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Motley series in the same family. Similar soils include the Acuff, Altus, Estacado, Farry, Madge, Miles, Texroy, and Tipton series. 
Motley soils lack carbonates within 91 cm (36 in) and a calcic horizon within 152cm (60 in).
Acuff soils meet aridic-ustic soil moisture regimes and may contain a kk horizon with 50 percent or more calcium carbonate from 97 to 147 cm (38 to 58 in).
Altus, Texroy and Tipton soils decrease 20 percent or more (relative) from the maximum clay content (noncarbonate clay) within 150 cm (59 in) of the mineral soil surface not meeting the pale feature. These soils also have a mollic epipedon more than 51 cm (20 in) thick. 
Estacado soils meet aridic-ustic soil moisture regimes.
Farry and Madge soils decrease 20 percent or more (relative) from the maximum clay content (noncarbonate clay) within 150 cm (59 in) of the mineral soil surface not meeting the pale feature.
Miles soils do not have a mollic epipedon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: loamy alluvium of Quaternary age
Landscape: dissected plains
Landform: nearly level to very gently sloping terraces
Slope: 0 to 3
Mean annual precipitation: 533 to 711 mm (21 to 28 in)
Thornthwaite annual P-E Index: 30 to 38
Mean annual air temperature 13.9 to 18.3 degrees C (57 to 65 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 200 to 240 days
Elevation: 304.8 to 883.9 m (1000 to 2900 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Frankirk, Miles, Sagerton, and Woodward series. 
Frankirk and Sagerton soils: these soils have a fine particle-size control section and occur on similar landscape positions.
Miles soils: these soils do not have a mollic epipedon and occur on slightly higher positions on uplands. 
Woodward soils: these soils do not have an argillic horizon or mollic epipedon and occur on shoulders and backslopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained. Permeability is moderate. Runoff is negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes and low on 1 to 3 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of these soils are cultivated.  Cotton, grain sorghum, and wheat are the principal crops.  Native vegetation consists mainly of midgrass and short grasses such as blue grama, sideoats grama, vine mesquite, and buffalograss with a light to moderate overstory of mesquite.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Rolling Red Plains, Western and Eastern parts (MLRA-78B & 78C) of Texas and Oklahoma.  The series is of moderate extent.
