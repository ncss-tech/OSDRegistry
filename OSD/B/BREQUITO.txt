BREQUITO SERIES

The Brequito series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess over colluvium and residuum from granitic or low mica metamorphic rock with a thin mantle of volcanic ash. They are on mountain slopes, ridges, structural benches and summits. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately slow and slopes range from 5 to 75 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 1,000 mm and the average annual air temperature is about 5.5 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brodeer, Mushel, and Lado series. Brodeer soils are on steep concave mountain side slopes, have thick volcanic ash mantles, and do not have a discrete loess layer. Mushel soils are on convex mountain side slopes, have thin volcanic ash mantles, and do not have a discrete loess layer. Lado soils are on concave mountain side slopes, have thick volcanic ash mantles and have a discrete loess layer.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained, medium to very rapid runoff, moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, watershed, and recreation.  Potential natural vegetation is western red cedar, grand fir, western larch, western white pine, Douglas-fir, and ponderosa pine with an understory of queencup beadlily, coolwort foamflower, princes pine, western goldthread, and bunchberry dogwood.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North Central Idaho. Brequito soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 43A.
