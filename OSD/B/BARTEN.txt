BARTEN SERIES

The Barten series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from basalt.  Barten soils are on basalt lava flows with slopes of 4 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches. The mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic Lithic Ustic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Barten extremely gravelly loam - rangeland and wildlife habitat.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)
 
A--0 to 1 inch; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely gravelly loam; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak medium platy structure parting to moderate medium granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; common very fine irregular and vesicular and few fine tubular pores; noneffervescent; 55 percent gravel, 15 percent cobble, 5 percent stone; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 3 inches thick.)

Bt--1 to 4 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly loam; dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak medium platy structure parting to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; many faint clay films on faces of peds and many distinct clay films lining pores; noneffervescent; 30 percent gravel, 10 percent cobble; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (2 to 7 inches thick.)

Btk1--4 to 10 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) gravelly clay loam; dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine through medium roots; common very fine through medium tubular pores; many faint to distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; few thin coats of calcium carbonate on the underside of rock fragments; slightly effervescent; 20 percent gravel, 10 percent cobble; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.

Btk2--10 to 19 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) very cobbly clay loam; dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots as masses, mainly exped; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common faint and distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; few fine soft filiments and common thin seams of calcium carbonate, common thin coats of calcium carbonate on the undeside of rock fragments; violently effervescent; 20 percent gravel, 30 percent cobble; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt irregular boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Btk horizons is 7 to 17 inches)

R--19 inches; basalt bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Mojave County, Arizona; located about 600 feet north and 2000 feet east of the southwest corner of Section 23, T. 33 N., R. 9 W.; 36 degrees 14 minutes 24 seconds north latitude and 113 degrees 14 minutes 10 seconds west longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  

Soil moisture:  Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section for 30 to 45 days cummulative, July through September.  Driest during May and June.  Ustic aridic soil moisture regime.

Soil temperature:  59 to 64 degrees F.

Rock Fragments:  averages 35 to 60 percent in the particle-size control section

Clay content:  20 to 35 percent in the particle-size control section

Depth to calcium carbonate:  4 to 9 inches

Depth to bedrock:  14 to 20 inches


A horizon

Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR

Chroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist.

Reaction:  slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline


Bt horizon

Hue:  7.5YR, 10YR

Chroma:  3 or 4, dry or moist

Texture of the fine earth:  loam, clay loam

Reaction:  slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline


Btk horizon

Hue:  7.5YR, 10YR

Value:  4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist

Chroma:  3 or 4, dry or moist

Texture of the fine earth:  loam, clay loam

Calcium carbonate equivalent:  2 to 10 percent


COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Lemitar (NM), Pantak (AZ) and Whitvin (AZ) series.  The Lemitar soils are formed in residuum derived from tuff and have a reaction class of neutral or less in the Bt and Btk, they aslo are at elevations of 5,000 to 7,200 feet and have bed rock at 8 to 14 inches.  Pantak and Whitvin soils do not have accmulation of calcium carbonates in the profile.  In addition, Pantak soils are neutral to slightly acid and Whitvin soils have hues redder than 7.5YR.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Barten soils are on basalt lava flows.  Slopes range from 4 to 35 percent.  They formed in colluvium and residuum from basalt.  Elevations range from 3600 to 4500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 62 degrees F.  The frost free period is 200 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Hyrhy soils.  Hyrhy soils are more than 20 inches deep to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to high runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Barten soils are used for livestock grazing, recreation and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation includes big galleta, banana yucca, Anderson wolfberry, prickly pear, broom snakeweed and red brome.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Arizona; MLRA is 30.  Barten soils are not extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California.
