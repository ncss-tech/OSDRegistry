Latitude: 25.6725278
Longitude: -80.1551806
Datum: WGS84 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Solum thickness range: 203 centimeters (80 inches) or more
Depth to seasonally high-water table: 46 to 107 centimeters (18 to 42 inches)
Soil Reaction: slightly acid to moderately alkaline throughout (pH 5.6 to 8.4) 
Ochric epipedon thickness: 2 to 15 centimeters (1 to 6 inches)
Depth of Anthropogenic sandy fill material: 51 to 203 centimeters (20 to 80 inches)
Rock and/or shell fragments: weighted average is less than 20 percent in the control section, but may range from 0 to 70 percent
Some pedons have silty clay loam, clay, or sandy clay buried horizons at depths greater than 102 centimeters (40 inches).


^A horizon:
Hue: 10YR or Neutral
Value: 3 or 4
Chroma: 1 or 2 
Texture: fine sand or sand
Clay content: 0 to 7 percent
EC (mmhos/cm): 0 to 2

^C or ^Cg horizon:
Hue: 10YR 
Value: 3 to 7
Chroma: 1 to 3 
Texture: fine sand, sand, or loamy fine sand
Redoximorphic features: depletions and/or concentrations, 1 to 20 percent, and fine or medium in size 
Clay content: 0 to 5 percent
EC (mmhos/cm): 0 to 4

2Cbg horizon:
Hue: 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, 10Y, 5GY, or Neutral 
Value: 4 to 8
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: fine sand, sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand
Redoximorphic features: depletions and/or concentrations, 1 to 20 percent, and fine or medium in size
Clay content: 0 to 5 percent
EC (mmhos/cm): 0 to 8

Silty clay loam, clay loam, or sandy clay bodies range from 1 to 10 percent in at least some part of this horizon. These bodies are stratified in some pedons.  Fragments of a histic, mollic, albic, or argillic horizons range from 1 to 10 percent.

Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 1 or 2

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landscape: Lower Coastal Plain
Landform(s): Anthropogenic features filled and disturbed on flatwoods, low broad flats, low ridges and/or knolls bordering marshes, swamps, and estuaries 
Parent material: anthropogenic sandy fill material over sandy marine sediments
Mean annual temperature: 25 to 27 degrees C (77 to 79 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 1397 to 1778 millimeters (55 to 70 inches)
Frost-free period: 365 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  
These are the Canaveral, Crandon Beach, and Palm Bean soils. Canaveral soils lack anthropogenic fill materials, are composed entirely of sandy and shelly marine sediments, and occur on slightly higher landform positions.
Crandon Beach soils lack anthropogenic fill materials, are composed entirely of sandy and shelly marine sediments, and occur in lower landform positions which are flooded by the tides.
Palm Beach soils lack anthropogenic fill materials, are composed entirely of sandy and shelly marine sediments, and occur on higher landform positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage class: Somewhat poorly drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (KSAT): high to very high 
Permeability: moderately rapid to rapid 
Surface runoff: high to very high
Depth to seasonal high-water table: 46 to 107 centimeters (18 to 42 inches) of the surface for about 6 months during most years, and within 76 to 203 centimeters (30 to 80 inches) most of the rest of the year.
Flooding: from hurricanes rare for very brief periods

USE AND VEGETATION:  
Major uses: recreation and urban development.  
Dominant vegetation: southern red cedar, south Florida Slash Pine, and cabbage palm with an understory of waxmyrtle, blackberry, greenbrier, and panicums.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  MLRA 156A Florida Everglades and Associated Areas. 
Extent: Small Extent

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE:  Auburn, Alabama. 

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Miami-Dade County, Florida; 2019.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:

1.	Particle-size control section: 25 to 203 centimeters (10 to 80 inches)
2.	Anthropogenic features - 0 to 145 centimeters (0 to 57 inches) (^A, ^C1, ^C2, ^C3 horizons)
3.	Buried soil - 145 to 203 centimeters (57 to 80 inches) (2Cbg horizon)
4.	Aquic conditions - Endosaturation 46 to 107 centimeters (18 to 42 inches)

These soils were formerly mapped as made land or Arents or Udorthents. With future urban update mapping this soil could be extensive.
