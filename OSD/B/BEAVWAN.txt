BEAVWAN SERIES

The Beavwan series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and outwash.  These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans or outwash fans.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcidic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Beavwan loam in pasture (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 5 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots, and few medium roots; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt1--5 to 7 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots, and few medium roots; common faint clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary.

    Bt2--7 to 15 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots, and few medium roots; common faint clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary. (combined thickness of Bt1 and Bt2 horizons -- 6 to 15 inches).

    2Btk--15 to 22 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly sandy clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots, and few medium roots; few faint clay films bridging sand grains; 30 percent gravel and 25 percent cobbles; calcium carbonate coats on undersides of rock fragments; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick)

    2Bk--22 to 28 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly sandy loam; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; granular structure; soft, loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; 40 percent gravel and 25 percent cobbles; calcium carbonate coats on rock fragments, finely disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 15 inches thick)

    2BCk--28 to 60 inches; variegated extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; 45 percent gravel and 30 percent cobbles; calcium carbonate coats on rock fragments in upper part, finely disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

Beavwan soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Soil interpretations records - MT1343, MT1344.

Additional information: Based on the profile description and the Range in Characteristics, the classification was revised from Aridic Argiustolls to Calcidic Argiustolls.
