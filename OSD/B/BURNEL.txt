BURNEL SERIES

The Burnel series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans, drainageways, and foot slopes of hills.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Fergus County, Montana, 1979.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT0303.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 21 inches (Ap, Bt1, Bt2 horizons); an argillic horizon from 6 to 26 inches (Bt horizons); and horizons of lime accumulations from 26 to 50 inches (Bk horizons).  Burnel soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on udic.
