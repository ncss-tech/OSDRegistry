BARKOF SERIES

The Barkof series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum or colluvium derived from semiconsolidated shale.  These soils are on sedimentary plains, escarpments, ridges, and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Leptic Udic Haplusterts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Barkof clay in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 7 inches; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; strong fine granular structure; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and very plastic; a thin 1/8-inch surface crust forms when dry; many very fine roots; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual boundary. (4 to 7 inches thick)

    Bss--7 to 24 inches, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium and coarse subangular blocky; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and very plastic; many very fine roots in upper part decreasing to few very fine roots in the lower part, most roots are along the faces of prisms; few very fine pores; continuous distinct intersecting slickensides in the lower part; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline; gradual boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick)

    BC--24 to 28 inches; olive gray (5Y 5/2) clay, olive gray (5Y 4/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and very plastic; few fine roots; few weathered shale chips; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual boundary. (0 to 13 inches thick)

    Cr--28 to 60 inches; gray (5Y 5/1) semiconsolidated shale, dark gray (5Y 4/1) moist; few fine roots in upper part along bedding planes; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Blaine County, Montana; 150 feet west and 30 feet south of the NE corner of sec. 14, T.26 N., R. 23 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil temperature - 40 to 47 degrees F.
Moisture control section - between 4 to 12 inches.
Control section - 45 to 60 percent clay.
Depth to Cr horizon - 20 to 40 inches.

In most years, this soil has 1/4- to 2-inch cracks that extend from the surface to 20 or 30 inches from late June through September.  Intersecting slickensides and pressure faces are faint to prominent.  A dry phase is recognized.

COMPETING SERIES:

Aaberg (CO) - moderately well drained; has a mesic temperature regime.

Styers (T)(CO) - hues of 7.5YR and redder in the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - sedimentary plains; escarpments; hills; ridges.
Elevation - 1,900 to 4,700 feet.
Slope - 0 to 45 percent.
Parent material - residuum or colluvium derived from semiconsolidated shale.
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers.
Mean annual precipitation - 13 to 19 inches.
Mean annual temperature - 40 to 45 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 90 to 120 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Barkof soils are used mainly for rangeland and dryland cropland.  Potential native vegetation is mainly rough fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, green needlegrass, and western wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Barkof soils are of moderate extent in central and eastern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Blaine County, Montana, 1976.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT0261, MT0855.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the surface to 7 inches (A horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 28 inches (Bss and BC horizons); and a paralithic contact at a depth of 28 inches.  Barkof soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
