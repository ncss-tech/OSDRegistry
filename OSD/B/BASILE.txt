BASILE SERIES

The Basile series consists of very deep, poorly drained, slowly permeable soils.  These nearly level flood plain soils formed in loamy alluvial sediments.  They are saturated during winter and early spring.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent but are dominantly less than 0.5 percent.   Mean annual air temperature is about 19.5 degrees C (67 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1549 mm (61 in).

Barbary soils:  very poorly drained;  lower in the landscape in swamps;   n-value more than 0.7.
Brule soils:  slightly higher in flood plains; are Ultisols.  
Kinder soils: higher on the landscape; siliceous mineralogy. 
Vidrine soils:  on low mounds; better drained

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained.  Runoff is low.  Permeability is slow.  The water table is within 1.5 feet of the surface from December to May in most years. Frequent flooding for long periods from January to December.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly as woodland.  Native vegetation is mixed hardwood.  Cleared areas are used for pasture.  A few areas are used for truck crops, soybeans, or rice.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwest Louisiana along major bayous (MLRA 150A; LRR T).  The series is moderately extensive.
