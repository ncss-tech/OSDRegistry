BELLOWING SERIES

The Bellowing series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in alluvium derived from granitoid. Bellowing soils are on fan aprons over fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Buzzardsprings, Oldad (T) and Superstition series. Buzzardsprings soils have a calcic horizon with an upper boundary between 10 and 36 cm. Oldad soils are formed in eolian deposits over fan remnants. Superstition soils are on dunes and have less than 5 percent rock fragments throughout. In addition, Superstition soils receive mostly summer precipitation.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bellowing soils are on fan aprons over fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. These soils formed in alluvium derived from granitoid. Elevations range from 605 to 950 meters (1,985 to 3,115 feet). The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 75 to 125 mm (3 to 5 inches); mean annual air temperature is 20 to 23 degrees C (68 to 73.5 degrees F). The frost-free season is 300 to 340 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Pintobasin and Sunmill soils. Pintobasin soils are found on similar landscape position and do not have a calcic horizon. Sunmill soils are found on adjacent fan remnants, have an argillic horizon, and a coarse-loamy particle size control section. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat excessively drained; very low runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Bellowing soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is burrobush and creosote bush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southeastern California; MLRA 30. These soils are of small extent.
