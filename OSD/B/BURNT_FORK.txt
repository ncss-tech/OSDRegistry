BURNT FORK SERIES

The Burnt Fork series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium and colluvium. These soils are on fan remnants, eroded fan remnants, and escarpments in intermountain valleys. Slopes are 0 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 368 mm and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Burnt Fork loam, in rangeland on a 2 percent slope at 1,118 meters elevation (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise indicated). 

	A--0 to 25 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate coarse granular structure; friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (18 to 36 cm thick)

	Bw--25 to 46 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable, hard, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 40 cm thick)

	Bk1--46 to 61 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine irregular pores; 5 percent gravel; few fine distinct calcium carbonate masses in the matrix; strongly effervescent, moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary.

	Bk2--61 to 104 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common fine irregular pores; 5 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; common fine carbonate masses and weakly cemented carbonate nodules in the matrix; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of Bk horizons 25 to 100 cm)

	BCk--104 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; common fine irregular pores; 30 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; few distinct carbonate coats on bottom surfaces of rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).
