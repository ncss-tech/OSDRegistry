BEULAH SERIES

The Beulah series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapid permeable soils that formed in loamy and sandy alluvium. These level to gently sloping soils are on floodplains and low terraces in natural levees positions bordering former channels of the Mississippi River, MLRA 131. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, active, thermic Typic Dystrudepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Beulah very fine sandy loam--cultivated. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap1--0 to 4 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) very fine sandy loam; weak fine granular structure; friable; many fine roots; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.

 Ap2--4 to 8 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) very fine sandy loam; weak fine granular structure; friable; many fine roots; few fine pores; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Ap horizon ranges from 4 to 12 inches thick.)

 Bw1--8 to 23 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) very fine sandy loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine roots; few fine pores; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary.

 Bw2--23 to 28 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very fine sandy loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; few fine pores; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bw horizon ranges from 18 to 48 inches thick.)

 C1--28 to 36 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loamy fine sand; structureless, massive; friable; few fine roots; few fine pores; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.

 C2--36 to 48 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) fine sand; structureless, single grain; loose; few fine roots; few fine pores; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.

 C3--48 to 61 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) fine sand; structureless, single grain; loose; few horizontal pale brown (10YR 6/3) bedding planes; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.

 C4--61 to 72 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sand; structureless, single grain; loose; few horizontal brown (10YR 5/3) bedding planes; slightly acid.

TYPE LOCATION: Phillips County, Arkansas; 1 mile east of Wabash and within the half circle formed by Old Town Lake. SE1/4NE1/4SE1/4, sec. 29, T. 3 S., R. 3 E.; lat. 34 degrees 23 minutes 56.86 seconds N. and long. 90 degrees 48 minutes 17.81 seconds W., NAD83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum ranges from about 24 to 60 inches thick. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the A horizon; strongly acid to slightly acid in the Bw horizon and strongly acid to neutral in the C horizon.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 2 to 4, or with value of 5, and chroma of 3 or 4, or hue of 7.5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 4. Texture is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand or loamy very fine sand.

The Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3, 4 or 6, or hue of 7.5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 4. Iron accumulations and depletions are in shades of brown. Texture is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.

The C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. Iron accumulations and depletions are in shades of brown or gray. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sand or sand.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Beulah soils are on floodplains and low terraces in old natural levee positions along bayous, oxbows and abandoned channels of the Mississippi River and other larger streams in the Lower Mississippi Valley.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Beulah soils are associated with Askew, Bosket, Dubbs and Dundee soils. Askew, Bosket, Dubbs and Dundee soils all contain argillic horizons and occur on terrace tread positions on the landscape.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; slow to moderate runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas have been cleared and used for intensive agriculture. The main crops are soybeans, cotton and wheat. The native vegetation was mixed hardwood forests of cottonwood, pecan and oaks.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Western Lowlands and St. Francis Basin of Arkansas and Missouri; Yazoo Basin of Louisiana and Mississippi and other areas along the current and former channels of the Mississippi River and other larger streams in the Lower Mississippi Valley in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee. The series is of moderate extent.
