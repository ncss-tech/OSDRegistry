MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Halifax County, Virginia, 2003. 

REMARKS: Banister soils were previously mapped as Dogue soils. The April 1997 relocation of the mesic/thermic line necessitated the establishment of the mesic counterpart.  In April 2008, due to insufficent data, the classification was changed back to Ultisols.  When data collection is complete across the MLRA region, a decision will be made as to whether an Alfisols series is needed.   

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to 14 inches (Ap and BA horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 14 to 58 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and Btg horizons)
Aquic conditions--periodic saturation and reduction in a zone from 18 to 80 inches of the soil surface at some time during the year (endosaturation) 
Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches 

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Laboratory Data: Reference samples of three pedons are available from Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Blacksburg, VA.
