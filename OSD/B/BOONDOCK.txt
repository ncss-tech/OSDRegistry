BOONDOCK SERIES

The Boondock series consists of very shallow soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from sedimentary rocks. Boondock soils are on rock pediments and hills. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy, mixed, superactive, nonacid, mesic, shallow Xeric Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Boondock gravelly fine sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is covered with 25 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles.

  A1--0 to 2 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium platy structure parting to moderate very fine subangular blocky; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; few very fine and fine vesicular pores; 20 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 8 cm thick)

  A2--2 to 10 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine to medium roots; common fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 13 cm thick)

  C--10 to 15 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine to medium roots; common fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 10 cm thick)

  Cr--15 to 41 cm; fractured and weathered sedimentary rock; root mats and clay films in fractures and cracks.

TYPE LOCATION: Douglas County, Nevada; 10 feet south and 2,600 feet west of the northeast corner of section 34, T. 14 N., R. 21 E.; USGS Mineral Peak 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 02 minutes 33 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 36 minutes 42 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.0426111 latitude, -119.6116667 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist in winter and early spring, dry in summer and fall; aridic (torric) soil moisture regime that borders on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 10 to 14 degrees C.
Depth to bedrock: 12 to 25 cm to a paralithic contact.

Particle-size control section - Percent clay: Averages 18 to 30 percent.
Rock fragments: Averages 5 to 15 percent. Lithology of the fragments is mainly sedimentary rocks such as sandstone and siltstone. Surficial rock fragments have varied lithology.

A horizon
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 3 or 4

C horizons
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 5 or 6 dry.
Chroma: 3 or 4.
Texture: Loam or clay loam; some pedons have subhorizons of sandy loam.
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent.
Structure: Massive or subangular blocky.
Consistence: Soft or slightly hard, dry; very friable or friable, moist; slightly sticky or moderately sticky and slightly plastic or moderately plastic, wet.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Budihol, Haar, and Nicanor series.  

Budihol soils average 12 to 18 percent clay and 15 to 30 percent rock fragments.  Haar soils average 10 to 18 percent clay and have 50 to 90 percent paragravel fragments.  Nicanor soils have 15 to 35 percent metamorphic rock fragments in the particle-size control section and have lithic contacts within 100 centimeters of the soil surface. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Boondock soils are on rock pediments and hills. They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from Tertiary sedimentary rocks. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 1,370 to 2,010 meters . The climate is cool-semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 9 to 13 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chalco, Indian Creek, Phing and Pung soils. All these soils have more than 35 percent clay in the control section. In addition, Chalco soils have argillic horizons and are 25 to 50 cm deep to paralithic contacts. Indian Creek soils have indurated duripans. Phing and Pung soils have argillic horizons and are very deep.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained, high or very high surface runoff; moderately slow permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Boondock soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is a sparse stand of mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, horsebrush, ephedra, antelope bitterbrush, purple sage, Indian ricegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, Utah juniper, and singleleaf pinyon. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 26.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California.
