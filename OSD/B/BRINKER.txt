BRINKER SERIES

The Brinker series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks and influenced by diatomaceous earth and volcanic ash over lacustrine deposits.  Brinker soils are on lake plains and flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Fluvaquentic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Brinker silt loam--irrigated cropland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    2Ab--33 to 84 cm; olive gray (5Y 4/2) clay, black (5Y 2/1) moist; weak fine prismatic structure that parts to strong medium angular blocky; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many fine tubular pores; many fine and medium very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2), dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2), and very dark brown (7.5YR 2/2) zones of iron depletion; few strata of volcanic ash 2 to 15 mm thick; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (38 to 64 cm thick)

    2Cg--84 to 152 cm; light gray (5Y 7/2) clay, olive gray (5Y 5/2) moist; massive; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; no roots; no pores; few fine and medium prominent dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) masses of iron accumulation; many fine to large light gray (5Y 7/2) and white (5Y 8/1) mollusk shells and carbonate masses; few very dark gray (5YR 3/1) dry and black (2.5Y 2/1) moist lenses 0.5 to 3 cm thick; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

TYPE LOCATION:  Pershing County, Nevada; about 8 miles south-southwest of Lovelock; approximately 125 feet west and 625 feet south of the northeast corner of section 8, T. 25 N. R. 31 E; USGS Granite Point 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 03 minutes 17 seconds N and longitude 118 degrees 30 minutes 59 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.0548333 latitude, -118.5163889 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually saturated for one month or more during most years unless drained; Seasonal periods of aquic moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 14 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 25 to 46 cm.
Depth to lithologic discontinuity: 13 to 36 cm.
Carbonates: The calcium carbonate equivalent is less than 15 percent throughout.  Fresh water mollusk shells and shell fragments can occur in any horizon, and range from few to many.
Reaction: Moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.
Other features: Apparent field texture in the upper part is stratified silt loam to silty clay and is clay in the lower part.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 35 to 45 percent in the upper part and 60 to 80 percent in the lower part.  The upper part is influenced by diatomaceous earth and volcanic ash and the lower part is dominated by smectitic clay.

Texture: Dominately clay, but can include strate of silt loam to silty clay loam.
Electrical conductivity (EC): 0 to 32 dS/m.
Sodium absorption ratio (SAR): 13 to 30.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Lovelock series.  Lovelock soils are dominated by clay size volcanic ash and diatomaceous material throughout the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Brinker soils are on lake plains and flood plains.  These soils formed alluvium derived from mixed rocks and influenced by diatomaceous earth and volcanic ash over lacustrine deposits.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent and are dominantly less than 0.5 percent.  Elevations range from 1,185 to 1,205 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, the mean annual air temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 120 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Armydrain, Bigmeadow, Humboldt, Kniesley, and Ryepatch soils and the competing Lovelock soil.  Armydrain, Bigmeadow, Humboldt, Kniesley, and Ryepatch soils are not influenced by volcanic ash and diatomaceous earth in the clay fraction in the upper part of the control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained; very low to medium surface runoff; moderate permeability; high saturated hydraulic conductivity in the upper part and slow; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity) in the lower part.  The water table under natural conditions ranges from 3 to 90 cm.  Drainage ditches have been constructed and the water table is below 180 cm during the irrigation season.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Brinker soils are used for small grains and alfalfa.  Areas that are strongly saline are used for native pasture, rangeland, and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is inland saltgrass, basin wildrye, and black greasewood.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  These soils are not extensive with about 5,900 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 27.
