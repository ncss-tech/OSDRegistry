BRIABBIT SERIES

The Briabbit series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils with moderately rapid permeability that formed in mixed alluvium and eolian sand from vitric tuffs and lacustrine deposits.  Briabbit soils are on foothills and structural benches.  Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Haplocalcids

TYPIC PEDON:  Briabbit fine sandy loam -- on a east-facing slope of 8 percent, in native rangeland at 3,300 feet elevation.  (When described on June 18, 1984, the soil was dry throughout.  Colors are for air-dry soils unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse platy structure parting to weak fine subangular blocky; soft, very friable; common very fine, fine and medium, few coarse roots; common very fine and fine vesicular pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.3); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw--3 to 10 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate coarse platy structure parting to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable; few very fine, medium and coarse roots; common fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 14 inches thick)

    Bk--10 to 22 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) cobbly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; few very fine and fine roots; 10 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, lime coatings on rock fragments; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); abrupt irregular boundary.  (10 to 24 inches thick)

    Cr--22 inches; soft, highly fractured vitric tuff, lime partially fills fractures.

TYPE LOCATION:  Owyhee County, Idaho; about 4 1/2 miles west and 3 miles north of Murphy; 1,400 feet east and 1,200 feet north of the southwest corner of section 12, T.2 S., R.3 W.; 43 degrees, 15 minutes, 34 seconds North Latitude and 116 degrees, 38 minutes, 36 seconds West Longitude.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Adkins, Bijorja, Chedehap, Clems, Crestline, Haybourne, Irrigon, Kecko, McClenden, Prosser, Rebel, Royal, Sagehill, Scooteney, Vining and Wiehl series.  Adkins, Chedehap, Clems, Crestline, Haybourne, Kecko, McClendon, Rebel, Royal, Sagehill and Scooteney soils are greater than 40 inches deep.  Bijorja soils have over 50 percent of the coarse fragments in the 2 to 5 millimeter size range.  Prosser and Vining soils are over hard bedrock.  Irrigon and Wiehl soils lack calcareous horizons.  Vining soils lack lime above 18 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Briabbit soils are undulating to rolling on foothills sideslopes and on knolls and low ridges of structure benches at elevations of 2,300 to 4,500 feet.  Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium and eolian sand from vitric tuffs and lacustrine deposits.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and hot and dry in the summer.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 10 inches.  Average annual temperature ranges from 48 to 53 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 105 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Hardtrigger, Murphill and Tindahay series.  The Hardtrigger and Tindahay soils are greater than 40 inches deep on lower or concave landscape positions.  Murphill soils are less than 20 inches deep on summits and shoulders.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Briabbit soils are used mainly for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The dominate natural vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, Indian ricegrass, needleandthread grass and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Idaho.  Briabbit soils are of moderate extent.
