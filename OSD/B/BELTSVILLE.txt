REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 20 cm (Oi, A, and E horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 20 to 165 cm (Bt, Btx1, Btx2 and 2Bt horizons)
Fragipan--the zone from 51 to 104 cm (Btx horizons) 
Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Lithologic discontinuity--the zone beginning at 104 cm 
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 200 cm 
The type location is moved because the former type location has been developed and the typical pedon is no longer available for study.
