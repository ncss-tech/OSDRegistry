BUCAN SERIES

The Bucan series consist of deep, well drained soils formed in loess high in volcanic ash over residuum derived from volcanic rocks and tuff.  The Bucan soils are on hill and mountain side slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:   These are the Deseed and Fortank series.  

Deseed and Fortank soils are moderately deep to bedrock. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:   Bucan soils are on hill and mountain side slopes.  These soils formed in loess high in volcanic ash over residuum and colluvium derived from extrusive volcanic rocks and tuff.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,520 to 2,440 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Creva, Havingdon, Humdun, Softscrabble, and Walti soils.  Creva soils are shallow to bedrock and are loamy-skeletal.  Havingdon soils are moderately deep and clayey-skeletal.  Humdun soils are very deep and coarse-loamy.  Softscrabble soils are loamy-skeletal and have thick mollic epipedons.  Walti soils are moderately deep and have mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly of big sagebrush, Douglas rabbitbrush, littleleaf horsebrush, Thurber needlegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass and cheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 24 and 25.
