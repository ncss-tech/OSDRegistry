BOURNE SERIES

Soils of the Bourne series are very deep and moderately well drained. They formed in stratified marine and fluvial deposits. Permeability is slow to very slow in the fragipan. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual temperature is above 59 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation is about 43 inches. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, semiactive, thermic Typic Fragiudults 

TYPICAL PEDON: Bourne fine sandy loam - forested (Colors are for moist soils). 

   0i--0 to 1 inches; pine needles, leaves, and other partially decomposed organic material. 

   A--1 to 7 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) fine sandy loam; weak very fine granular structure; very friable; common fine and medium roots; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick) 

   EB--7 to 13 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) fine sandy loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable, few fine and medium roots; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick) 

   Bt1--13 to 19 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) sandy clay loam; few fine faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) mottles; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic; few rounded pebbles of quartz up to 2 inches in diameter; few fine roots; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick) 

   Bt2--19 to 29 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay loam; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) mottles; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few fine roots; thin continuous clay films; few rounded pebbles of quartz up to 2 inches in diameter; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. (6 to 24 inches thick) 

   Bx1--29 to 36 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) loam; strong very coarse prismatic parting to moderate, very thick platy structure; firm; brittle; few fine roots; thin continuous strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay films; 15 percent rounded fragments of quartz up to 4 inches in diameter; common medium distinct light gray (10YR 7/2) iron depletions; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. 

   Bx2--36 to 53 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) sandy clay loam; many medium and coarse distinct red (2.5YR 4/6), very pale brown (10YR 7/3), and strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) mottles; strong very coarse prismatic parting to moderate very thick platy structure; firm, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; brittle; thin continuous clay films; 10 percent rounded pebbles of quartz up to 2 inches in diameter; very strongly acid; clear irregular boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bx horizons is 6 to 47 inches). 

   C--53 to 81 inches; dark red (2.5YR 3/6), brownish yellow (10YR 6/6), and light gray (10YR 7/2) clay loam; massive; friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few rounded pebbles of quartz up to 1 inch in diameter; very strongly acid. 

TYPE LOCATION: Goochland County, Virginia; 14.3 miles southeast of Goochland, Virginia in a wooded area; 0.6 mile south of Highway 6; and 0.6 miles northeast of the intersection of Highways 650 and 649. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 inches to 70 inches. Depth to fragipan commonly is 18 to 35 inches. Rounded pebbles of quartz up to 15 percent by volume occur throughout the solum in some pedons. Reaction commonly is strongly to extremely acid unless limed. In some pedons, there is a lithologic discontinuity below the fragipan.

The A1 or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, chroma of 2 through 4. The A2 horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 through 4. The A horizon is fine sandy loam, loam, sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam. 

The BE horizon has colors similar to the Bt horizons and is fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam. 

The Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 8. Some Bt horizons have mottles with chroma of 3 or more. The Bt horizons typically are loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam and range to silt loam and silty clay loam. Silt content is more than 20 percent. 

The Bx horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 8. In some pedons it is mottled. The lower part of the Bx horizon often is multicolored and has hues ranging from 2.5YR to 5Y. Textures of the Bx horizons are fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam. 

The BC horizon, where present, has colors similar to the Bx horizon and ranges from loamy sand to clay. In some pedons, there is plinthic- like material. 

The C horizon, where present, is multicolored in shades of yellow, brown, gray and red. Textures range from clay to loamy sand, plus gravelly analogues. Some pedons contain up to 50 percent pebbles in the C horizon. 

COMPETING SERIES: The York series is in the same family and the Beltsville, Cane, Locust, Ora, Prentiss, Savannah and Vaucluse series are in closely related families. York soils have coarse fragments of angular quartz and schist in the solum. Beltsville soils have mean annual soil temperature of less than 59 degrees F. Cane, Ora, Savannah and Vaucluse soils have siliceous mineralogy; in addition, Ora soils have Bt horizons in hues of 2.5YR or 5YR. Locust and Prentiss soils lack Bt horizons above the fragipan. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bourne soils are on nearly level to sloping uplands. Slopes are dominantly 0 to 6 percent but range from 0 to 15 percent. The soil developed in stratified marine and fluvial deposits. The climate is temperate and humid. Mean annual precipitation is 35 to 47 inches. Mean annual temperature is above 59 degrees F. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the competing Beltsville soils, and the Atlee, Caroline, Craven, Kempsville, Sassafras, Tetotum and Woodstown soils. None of these soils, except the Beltsville soils, have fragipans. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained; moderately slow to rapid runoff; slow internal drainage; slow or very slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for general farm crops such as corn, soybeans, small grains and pasture. Wooded areas are chiefly in Virginia pine, loblolly pine and oaks. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Virginia and southern Maryland, possibly North and South Carolina. The series is of moderate extent.

REMARKS: The Bourne series was formerly included in the Beltsville series.   The soil horizon depths were revised on 10/2021 to ensure the soil description began at the soil surface.
