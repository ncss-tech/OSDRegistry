BONEDRAW SERIES

The Bonedraw series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slow permeable soils formed in gravelly clayey alluvium derived from limestone of the Segovia and Fort Terrett Formations. These nearly level to gently sloping soils occur in draws of dissected plateaus. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE:  Temple, Texas.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Kerr County, Texas, 2017, Kerr County soil survey area, Texas, 2017. The series was named after a USGS topographic quadrangle named Boneyard Draw.

REMARKS: The series was formerly included in Denton, Krum, and Oakalla series. The series was separated based on a need for a soil for the draw landscape position. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle size control section: 25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in). (Bw1, Bw2, and Bw3 horizons)
Mollic epipedon: 51 to 84 cm (20 to 33 in) (A, Bw1, and Bw2 horizons)
