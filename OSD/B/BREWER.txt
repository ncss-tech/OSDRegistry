BREWER SERIES

The Brewer series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils. These nearly level soils formed in loamy and clayey alluvium material of Pleistocene age. Brewer soils are on flood plains subject to rare flooding in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (60 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 in). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, thermic Pachic Udertic Argiustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Brewer silty clay loam-pasture, at an elevation of 253.9 m (833 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Bt1--30 to 76 cm (12 to 30 in); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm; common distinct clay films on ped faces; neutral; gradual smooth boundary. 

    Bt2--76 to 127 cm (30 to 50 in); brown (7.5YR 4/2) silty clay, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium blocky structure; very hard, firm; many prominent clay films on ped faces; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 55 to 122 cm [22 to 48 in]) 

    BC--127 to 193 cm (50 to 80 in); reddish brown (5YR 4/3) silty clay loam; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; weak coarse blocky structure; very hard, firm; none to slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (Thickness of the BC horizon is 38 to 89 cm [15 to 35 in]) 

    Ck--193 to 228 cm (80 to 90 in); reddish brown (5YR 4/4) silty clay loam; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; massive; very hard, firm; common fine concretions of calcium carbonate, the fine-earth fraction is mostly noncalcareous; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline.
