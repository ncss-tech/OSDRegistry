BECKWITH SERIES

The Beckwith series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in loess.  These soils occur on slightly concave to nearly level positions on interfluves on dissected till plains and on treads of stream terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 953 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Chromic Vertic Albaqualfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Beckwith silt loam, in a narrow, slightly concave area on a level interfluve, in a cultivated field.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Btg2--53 to 79 centimeters; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) silty clay; strong medium subangular blocky structure; very firm; many distinct very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay films on faces of peds; few very dark grayish brown organic coats on peds; common fine dark accumulations (oxides); common fine distinct brown (10YR 4/3) and common fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.

 Btg3--79 to 99 centimeters; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; firm; common distinct very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay films on faces of peds; few white (10YR 8/1) silt coats in vertical streaks; common fine dark accumulations (oxides); common fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) and common fine distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) redoximorphic concentrations; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.

 Btg4--99 to 152 centimeters; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay loam; weak very coarse subangular blocky structure; firm; few very dark gray (10YR 3/1) stains on vertical faces; few clay coats along surfaces of root channels; common fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; slightly acid.  (Combined thickness of the Btg horizon is 75 to 135 centimeters.)
