BIDONIA SERIES 

The Bidonia series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from sandstone.  Bidonia soils are on plateaus and mesas and have slopes of 1 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, kaolinitic, mesic Lithic Ustic Haplargids 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bidonia very channery loam - woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    A1--0 to 1 inch; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very channery loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many vesicular pores; 25 percent channers, 10 percent flagstones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 3 inches thick) 

    A2--1 to 3 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) channery fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate thin platy structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few very fine roots; many vesicular pores; discontinuous stone line at 3 to 4 inches, horizontally oriented channers; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 2 inches thick) 

    Bt1--3 to 10 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) clay, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; few thin clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 10 inches thick) 

    Bt2--10 to 14 inches; yellowish red (5YR 4/6) channery clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) moist; strong very fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common moderately thick clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 30 percent channer-size pan fragments; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. 

    2R--14 inches; thin bedded fine grained sandstone; common red (2.5YR 4/6) clay films and lime coatings in fractures. 

TYPE LOCATION:  Mohave County, Arizona, about 5.5 miles southwest of Colorado City; 1000 feet east and 500 feet north of the southwest corner of section 15, T. 41N., R. 7W. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil Moisture:  Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July-September and December-March.  Driest during May and June.  Ustic aridic soil moisture regime. 

Rock Fragments:  less than 35 percent in the control section 

Soil temperature:  54 to 57 degrees F. 

Depth to bedrock:  10 to 20 inches 

A horizon 
Hue:  5YR, 7.5YR 
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist 
Chroma: 3 through 6, dry or moist 

Bt horizon 
Hue:  5YR, 7.5YR 
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist 
Chroma:  4 through 6, dry or moist 
Texture: clay, sandy clay, clay loam, loam 
Reaction:  slightly or moderately alkaline 

A Bk or Btk horizon with less than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent is present in some pedons. 

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bidonia soils are on plateaus and mesas at elevations of 4,900 to 5,800 feet.  These soils formed in alluvium from sandstone.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 52 to 55 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 165 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Kech, Barx and Mespun soils.  Kech soils are loamy.  Barx soils are fine-loamy, Mespun soils are sandy, and both are very deep. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained;  medium runoff;  slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Bidonia soils are used for livestock grazing and fuelwood harvesting.  The present vegetation is Utah Juniper and pinyon pine. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Arizona.  The series is of moderate extent. MLRA 35.
