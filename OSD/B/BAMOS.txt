BAMOS SERIES

The Bamos series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum, alluvium and colluvium derived from mixed intermediate igneous rocks. Bamos soils occur on foothills and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent.  The average annual perception is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Calciargidic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bamos very cobbly loam--rangeland. (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(0 to 25 cm thick)

     Bk1--61 to 69 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) gravelly clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure that parts to weak fine and very fine subangular blocky; hard, firm, moderately sticky, and moderately plastic; few medium, fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine tubular pores; 5 percent cobbles and 25 percent gravel; moderately calcareous, carbonates are disseminated and as thin coatings on rock fragments and as soft masses and veins; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Axford, Babbington, Benwy, Brogan, Caliralls, Drybed, Haw, and Zen series.   

Axford, Babbington, Benwy, Brogan, Caliralls, Drybed, Haw, and Polly soils are deeper than 100 cm. Zen soils have 0 to 5 percent rock fragments in the Bt horizon and lack Bk horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bamos soils occur on mountain sides and foothills at elevations of 1,620 to 2,135 meters. Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent.  These soils formed in residuum derived from mixed intermediate igneous rocks. The mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C. The mean summer temperature is 18 to 21 degrees C. The average annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm. The freeze-free period is 90 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Abela, Birdow, Denmark, Doyce and Pavant soils. Abela, Birdow and Doyce soils are more than 100 cm deep to bedrock. Denmark and Pavant soils are less than 20 cm deep to lime cemented hardpans.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate to rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat and recreation.  The natural vegetation is dominantly singleleaf pinyon, juniper, Wyoming big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush and cacti.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Utah. This soil is moderately extensive. MLRA 28A.
