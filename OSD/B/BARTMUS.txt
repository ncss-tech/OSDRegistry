BARTMUS SERIES

The Bartmus series consists of very shallow and shallow to a hardpan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from volcanic rock.  Bartmus soils are on mesas.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 59 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic, shallow Ustic Haplodurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bartmus very gravelly sandy loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 2 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate thin platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 40 percent gravel and 10 percent cobble; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick)

    Bw--2 to 6 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 40 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (4 to 14 inches thick)

    2Bkqm--6 to 19 inches; indurated hardpan with fractured thick laminar cap. (2 to 13 inches thick)

    3R--19 inches; rhyolite.

TYPE LOCATION: Mohave County, Arizona.  Located at a latitude of 35 degrees, 06 minutes, 11 seconds North and a longitude of 113 degrees, 32 minutes, 01 seconds west; 1100 feet east and 550 feet south of the northwest corner of section 15, T. 20 N., R. 12 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture: Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July-September and December-February.  Driest during May and June.  Ustic aridic soil moisture regime.

Depth to duripan: 5 to 18 inches

Depth to bedrock: 7 to 30 inches

Effervescence: slight to violent

A horizon
Hue:  7.5YR, 10YR
Value: 4 through 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist

Bw horizon
Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR
Value: 4 or 5, dry or moist
Chroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Bigtoe (T) (AZ) Series.  Bigtoe soils have a calcic horizon above the duripan.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bartmus soils are on mesas at elevations of 4,000 to 4,200 feet.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium from volcanic rock.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 61 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 210 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chiricahua, Gonzales, Lampshire, Penthouse and Romero soils.  Chiricahua and Romero soils are shallow to a paralithic contact.  Gonzales and Lampshire soils are less than 20 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Penthouse soils are very deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium or very high runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation includes black grama, sideoats grama, needleandthread, range ratany, desert ceanothus and turbinella oak.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Arizona.  This series is of small extent.  MLRA is 38.  The name is from a local ranch.
