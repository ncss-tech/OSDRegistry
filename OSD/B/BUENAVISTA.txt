BUENAVISTA SERIES

The Buenavista series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium. The Buenavista soils are stream terraces and terrace remnants. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 550 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 17 degrees C.
