GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landscape: Coastal Plain Flatwoods
Landform(s): Low flats, depressions and poorly defined drainageways

Wabasso soils--have Bh horizons and are Spodosols.  In addition, Wabasso soils have a Bt horizon below the spodic horizon and are on similar landscape positions. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class: Very poorly drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat): High to very high
Permeability: Rapid 
Surface runoff: Negligible
Flooding frequency and duration: None
Ponding frequency and duration: Under natural conditions the soil is covered by water (ponded) - very frequently for very long duration for 6 to 9 months, currently ponding is controlled by anthropogenic activities.

USE AND VEGETATION:  
Major Uses: Most areas of Basinger soils have been cleared and are used for improved pasture and rangeland.  With water control, they are used for winter truck crops and tame pasture.  
Dominant vegetation: Slash pine, long leaf pine, southern slash pine, scattered cypress with an understory dominated by gallberry, pineland threeawn, cabbage palm, scattered saw palmetto, St. Johns wort, cutthroat grass, blue maidencane, low panicum, wax-myrtle and sand cordgrass.
