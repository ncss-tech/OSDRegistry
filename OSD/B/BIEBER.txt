BIEBER SERIES

The Bieber series consists of very shallow and shallow to a duripan, well drained or moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Bieber soils are on stream terraces and fan remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Clayey, smectitic, mesic, shallow Argiduridic Durixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bieber gravelly loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(5 to 20 cm thick)

    Bt1--15 to 33 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; hard, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine interstitial and few very fine tubular pores; common faint clay films between mineral grains; 15 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 18 cm thick)

(10 to 20 cm thick)

    2Bqkm1--46 to 56 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) cemented material; moderate thick platy structure; indurated by secondary silica with 1 to 2 mm thick continuous laminar caps on the upper surface and cemented bands 1 to 2 cm apart below; 40 percent rounded gravel; strongly effervescent; secondary carbonates segregated in fine filaments; abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 15 cm thick)

    2Bqkm2--56 to 79 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) cemented material; massive; indurated by secondary silica; 60 percent rounded gravel and 10 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; secondary carbonates segregated as masses on bottoms of gravel; opaline silica segregated as concretions (pendants) on bottoms of gravel; clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 30 cm thick)

    2Bqkm3--79 to 152 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) cemented material; massive; indurated by secondary silica; 60 percent rounded gravel and 10 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; secondary carbonates segregated in fine masses in the matrix, as filaments in the matrix, and as masses on bottom of gravel; fewer gravel are coated than in above horizon; opaline silica segregated as concretions (pendants) on bottoms of gravel.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bieber soils are on stream terraces and fan remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from volcanic rocks such as andesite, basalt, and tuff.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 1,070 to 1,865 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 230 to 410 mm, including 90 to 120 mm of snow. The mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 50 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bidwell, Delma, Lassen, Modoc, Montague, Packwood, and Pit soils.  Bidwell soils are fine-loamy and very deep.  Delma soils are shallow to paralithic contacts.  Lassen soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Modoc soils are moderately deep to duripans.  Montague soils are moderately deep to petrocalcic horizons.  Packwood soils are loamy, shallow to duripans, have ochric epipedons.  Pit soils are very deep and do not have argillic horizons and duripans.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained or moderately well drained; very high surface runoff; low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Bieber soils are used mostly for range or pasture with small areas in dryland grain and irrigated pasture.  The vegetation in rangeland is low sagebrush and perennial grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern California, southwestern Idaho, and northern Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  The series concept and main acreage is in MLRA 21, while other acreage occurs in MLRAs 23 and 26 in California and Nevada and MLRA 25 in Idaho.
