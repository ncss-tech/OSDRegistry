BIDUYA SERIES

The Biduya series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in loamy residuum and colluvium weathered from Permian limestone and dolomite bedrock. Slopes range from 10 to 120 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm (14 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Lithic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Biduya very cobbly loam, on a southeast facing 15 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 2,012 m (6,601 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 13 cm, (0 to 5 in); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) very cobbly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2), moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; 15 percent angular indurated 5 to 75 mm limestone fragments and 35 percent angular indurated 76 to 250 mm limestone fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; very abrupt smooth boundary. (Thickness of the A horizon is 7 to 13 cm [3 to 5 in]) 

    R--13 to 38 cm, (5 to 15 in); indurated limestone bedrock. 

TYPE LOCATION: Culberson County, Texas; from the trailhead in Dog Canyon campgrounds in Guadalupe National Park; 4.1 miles west on the Bush Mountain trail, site is 0.9 mile west-northwest. (P X Flat, TX USGS topographic quadrangle; Latitude: 31 degrees, 58 minutes, 56 seconds N; Longitude: 104 degrees, 53 minutes, 47 seconds W; UTM Easting 509798 m, UTM Northing 3538481 m, UTM Zone 13, NAD83.)

Bedrock kind: strongly cemented and indurated limestone and dolomite 

COMPETING SERIES: These are; Arbol (NM), Faraway (AZ), Lostpeak (TX), Oro Grande (NM),  Rotogilla (NM), Seralin (NV), and Yaquican (AZ).
Arbol soils: have a paralithic contact
Faraway soils: are neutral to moderately acid
Lostpeak soils: have slopes greater than 40 percent and support a different ecosite 
Oro Grande: are derived from rhyolite and andesite
Rotogilla soils: are slightly acid to moderately acid 
Seralin: are in the Mojave Desert (MLRA30) and receive most of their precipitation in the winter
Yaquican soils: are neutral to slightly acid

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent Material: colluvium and residuum weathered from Permian age limestone and dolomite
Landscape: Mountains
Landform: Hills and Ridges
Slope: 10 to 25 percent
Soil moisture: Aridic Ustic soil moisture regime 
Mean annual soil temperature: 9.0 to 15.0 degrees C (48 to 59 degrees F) 
Mean annual air temperature: 8.0 to 14.0 degrees C (46 to 57 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 330 to 381 mm (13 to 15 inches)
Precipitation pattern: Most precipitation occurs as high intensity rain during afternoon convective thunderstorms from June to September.
Frost-free period: 135 to 250 days
Elevation: 1,832 to 2,441 m (6,010 to 8,008 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Desario (NM), Lazarus (NM) and the tentative Victorio (TX), Lost Peak (TX), and Lozen (TX) soils.
