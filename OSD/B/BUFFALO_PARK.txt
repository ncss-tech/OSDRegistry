BUFFALO PARK SERIES

The Buffalo Park series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess. Buffalo Park soils are on hillslopes, rises, and plains on tableland in the Central High Tablelands (MLRA 
72). The slopes range from 1 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 46 cm (18 inches), and the mean annual temperature is 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).

from late spring through early autumn. Precipitation in winter generally occurs as snow.  
Frost free period: 135 to 210 days  

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Colby, Duroc, Keith, and 
Ulysses soils.  
Colby soils are on steeper side slopes or convex ridges.  
Duroc soils are lower on the landscape, in draws  
Keith soils have a mollic epipedon and are on adjacent interfluves.  
Ulysses soils are on similar landscapes and have a mollic epipedon.  

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage: Well drained  
Runoff: low or medium  
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: high or moderately high  

USE AND VEGETATION: Mostly cultivated to winter wheat and grain sorghum. Native 
vegetation is short and mid grasses.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Kansas; LRR H, MLRA 72 Central High 
Tablelands. The Buffalo Park series is of moderate extent.  

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Salina, Kansas  

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Gove County, Kansas, 2018.  

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  
Ochric epipedon: the zone from the surface to a depth of 11 centimeters (4 inches) (Ap horizon). 
When this horizon meets the color requirements of a mollic epipedon, if fails to meet the 
thickness requirements.  
Cambic horizon: the zone from 11 to 40 centimeters (4 to 16 inches) (Bw, Bk1 horizons).  
The lithologic discontinuity is not diagnostic.  
Moisture regime: ustic/aridic  
The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by lab sample numbers: 
03N0882, 01P0281, and 95P0486.  
Taxonomy version: Eleventh edition, 2010  

ADDITIONAL DATA: This series is being established due to erosion of the Ulysses series.  
Additional data is available for this pedon (KSSL lab pedon IDs 03N0881, 03N0882, 01P0281, 
95P0486, 87P0014, 87P0015, 87P0027, and 87P0028).
