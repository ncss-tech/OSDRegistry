BADROCK SERIES

The Badrock series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from rhyolitic or andesitic rocks with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  Badrock soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-skeletal, glassy, frigid Aridic Lithic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Badrock extremely gravelly ashy sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is covered with 65 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones, and 2 percent boulders.

    Bt3--18 to 38 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/2) very gravelly ashy sandy clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular and common very fine interstitial pores; 25 percent distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 40 percent subangular gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); abrupt irregular boundary.

    R--38 to 63 cm; unweathered rhyolite bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Mono County, California; in the Bodie Hills about 4.8 kilometers northeast of the ghost town of Bodie; approximately 244 meters north and 762 meters east of the southeast corner of section 35, T. 5 N., R. 27 E.; USGS Kirkwood Spring 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 14 minutes 38.9 seconds N and longitude 118 degrees 58 minutes 3.7 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.2441389 latitude, -118.9676944 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually moist in the moisture control section during winter and spring; usually dry from July through early October; aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 18 to 36 cm; Includes the Bt1 horizon and may also include the Bt2 horizon in some pedons.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Domehill, Farepeak, Hardnut, Hardteph, and Schoolmarm series.

Domehill, Farepeak, and Hardteph soils have lithic contacts at depths of less than 36 cm. Hardnut soils average 60 to 80 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Schoolmarm soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Badrock soils are on hills and mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesite, rhyolite, or rhyolitic tuff with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,286 to 2,720 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 356 to 406 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bodiehill soil and the competing Domehill soil.  Bodiehill soils are very deep with bedrock deeper than 152 cm and have more than 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very high surface runoff; moderate permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Badrock soils are used for livestock grazing, recreation, watershed, and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, green ephedra, Thurber's needlegrass, Indian ricegrass, prairie junegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, and currant.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern California, in the western part of the Great Basin.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 26.
