BIXLER SERIES

The Bixler series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in sandy deposits over stratified lacustrine materials. They are on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent.

COMPETING SERIES: These are Leola, Markton, Rimer, and Selfridge series. Leola and Markton soils average less than 50 percent silt in the lower part of the argillic horizon. Rimer soils have rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Selfridge soils have an E horizon that is less than 38 cm (15 inches) thick.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Bixler soils are on ridges, low knolls, and backslopes on lake plains of late Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. The soils formed in sandy lacustrine materials over medium textured, stratified lacustrine sediments. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 914 mm (27 to 36 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 180 days. Elevation is 183 to 244 meters (600 to 800 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Colwood, Dixboro, Kibbie, Lamson, Oakville, Ottokee, Spinks, and Tedrow soils. Colwood and Lamson soils are poorly and very poorly drained and are on flats or in depressions. Dixboro and Kibbie soils do not have an arenic epipedon. Oakville soils are excessively drained, Ottokee soils are moderately well drained, and Spinks soils are well drained; in addition, these soils do not have 2B or 2C horizons of medium textured lacustrine sediments, and are on higher beach ridges and dunes. Tedrow soils do not have 2B or 2C horizons of medium textured lacustrine sediments.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from (0.5 to 1.5 feet) between November and May in normal years. The clayey substratum phase has a perched water table. The potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the sandy upper material and moderately high in the medium textured lacustrine sediments. Permeability is rapid in the sandy upper material and moderate in the medium textured lacustrine sediments.

USE AND VEGETATION: A large proportion is under cultivation, primarily corn, small grain, soybeans, and hay. Some areas are used for special crops such as cabbage, tomatoes, and potatoes. A few areas are in mixed hardwood forest. Native vegetation is mixed hardwood forests of beech, elm, hickory, maple, and oak.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwest Ohio and possibly southern Michigan; MLRA 99. The series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Lucas County, Ohio, 1978.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 71 cm (Ap, E1, E2 horizons).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 71 to 86 cm (Btg, 2Btg horizons).
Aquic conditions: redox features visible in all horizons below a depth of 25 cm.

A clayey substratum phase is recognized. It will need to be evaluated in future MLRA update activities.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available for pedons FT-25 and LS-6 (typical pedon) from The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory, Columbus, OH.
