BOSQUECITO SERIES

The Bosquecito series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, schist, and micaceous sandstone and siltstone.  Bosquecito soils are on flood plains of valley floors with intermittent streams.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Oxyaquic Ustifluvents

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Haigler and Kitcarson series.  Both of these soils receive peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer months and do not have significant amounts of mica in the silt and sand fractions.  In addition, Haigler soils have SAR above 15 within the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bosquecito soils are on natural levees and crevasse splays on flood plains of valley floors with intermittent streams.  They formed in alluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist, and Tertiary micaceous sandstone and siltstone.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,500 to 6,600 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cuyamungue, Jaralosa, and Mirada soils.  Cuyamungue soils are sandy-skeletal, have seasonal high water tables between 5 and 8 feet, and occur on low flood plains below Bosquecito.  Jaralosa soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, have seasonal high water tables between 3.5 and 5 feet from the soil surface, and occur on low flood plains.  Mirada soils are hydric, have seasonal high water tables near the soil surface, and occur on low flood plains.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; very low surface runoff; moderately rapid permeability in the loamy horizons and strata and rapid to very rapid permeability in the sandy horizons and strata.  These soils are subject to occasional, extremely brief periods of flooding between July and September.  Floodwaters have low velocity and are generally less than two feet deep.  A seasonal high water table is present between 2.0 and 3.5 feet.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Bosquecito soils are used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  The historic climax vegetation is cottonwood, western wheatgrass, willow, and bluegrass.  The ecological site is Populus fremontii/Salix exugia-Salix/Carex(F036XB137NM).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Bosquecito soils are of small extent on the southeastern Espanola Basin part of the Basin and Range province in northcentral New Mexico.  The MLRA is 36.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Santa Fe County, New Mexico; Santa Fe Area Soil Survey Update; 2008.  Bosquecito is a Spanish word for small woods.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 1 inch. (A horizon)

Fluventic feature - Alluvial stratification and an irregular organic-carbon distribution.

Oxyaquic feature - Aquic conditions (endosaturation and reduction) in all horizons between 26 and 64 inches.  Reduced iron ions are indicated by the horizons producing a strong red color after spot application of alpha, alpha-dipyridyl in a neutral, 1-normal ammonium acetate solution.  An anaerobic state is inferred by the stale, musty odor of the Cg horizons, which indicates the decomposition of organic matter in the absence of oxygen.

Depleted matrix - The presence of a low chroma matrix which contains reduced iron, but does not change color on exposure to air. (Cg1, Cg2 Cg3, and Cg4 horizons)  

Note:  This soil does not meet the Criteria for Hydric Soils as defined by the National Technical Committee for Hydric Soils (1994).
