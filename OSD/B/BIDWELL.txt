BIDWELL SERIES

The Bidwell series consists of very deep, well drained soils on fan remnants and fan skirts. They formed in ashy alluvium from tuffaceous rocks. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm (12 inches); mean annual air temperature is about 9.5 degrees C (49 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ashone (NV), Coppersmith (CA), Ponyspring (NV) and Simpson (CA) series. Ashone soils are moderately deep to weathered tuff. Coppersmith soils have depth ranging from 30 to 61 cm (12 to 24 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon and have Bq horizons with 20 to 70 percent durinodes. Ponyspring soils are intermittently moist in the summer for 10 to 20 days due to convection storms and have 15 to 35 percent gravel in the control section. Simpson soils have a mollic epipedon thickness of 50 to 69 centimeters (20 to 27 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bidwell soils are on fan remnants and fan skirts at elevations of 1,362 to 1,524 meters (4,470 to 5,000 feet). They formed in ashy alluvium from tuffaceous rocks. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The climate is cool semiarid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is about 305 to 406 mm (12 to 16 inches). Mean annual temperature is 7.2 to 9.4 degrees C (45 to 49 degrees F). The frost-free period is about 80 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Buntingville, Donica, Hussa, and Simpson series. Buntingville and Hussa soils are wet and have mottles within 50 centimeters of the surface. Donica soils lack an argillic horizon. Simpson soils have more than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderately slow permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity class.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for rangeland and cropland. Uncultivated areas have a cover of big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern California. The soil is of moderate extent. MLRA 21 AND 23.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Surprise Valley-Home Camp Area, California-Nevada, Modoc County, California, 1971.

REMARKS: This soil is reclassified in January, 2006, based on glass counts. The former classification was fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Calciargidic Argixerolls.

Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include: 
Mollic epipedon: The zone from 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 inches) (Ap1 and Ap2 horizons).
Argillic horizon: The zone from 25 to 117 cm (10 to 46 inches) (Bt1, Bt2 and Btk horizons).
Ashy particle-size substitute class and glassy mineralogy: 30 to 50 percent glass and glass aggregates by grain count throughout the profile.
Particle-size control section: The zone from 25 to 76 cm (10 to 30 inches) (Bt1 and part of the Bt2 horizons).
