MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Pasquotank County, North Carolina; 1951.

REMARKS: The April 1993 revision of this series places the Barclay series in coarse-silty, mixed, nonacid, thermic Aeric Endoaquepts. The series was previously in Aquic Dystrochrepts, but having redoximorphic features beginning at 7 inches, dominant chroma of 2 at 18 inches, and being somewhat poorly drained are soil properties that meet the requirements for Aeric Endoaquepts.

Diagnostic horizons and soil properties recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 7 inches (Ap horizon)
Cambic horizon--the zone from 7 to 57 inches (Bw, Bg1, Bg2, and BCg horizons)
