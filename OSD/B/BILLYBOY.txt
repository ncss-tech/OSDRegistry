BILLYBOY SERIES

The Billyboy series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of loess or silty alluvium, loamy alluvium and in the underlying stratified sandy outwash.  These soils are on outwash plains, stream terraces, outwash terraces, glacial lake plains, glacial drainageways, and outwash areas of moraines.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota: MLRA SSO 10-9 (Rhinelander, Wisconsin).

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Sawyer County, Wisconsin, 2002.

REMARKS:
Particle size control section--the zone from a depth of 51 to 89 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 51 centimeters (A, E, and E/B horizons);
albic horizon--the zone from a depth of 10 to 51 centimeters (E horizon and the E part of the E/B horizon);
glossic horizon--the zone from a depth of 28 to 66 centimeters (E/B and 2B/E horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 51 to 89 centimeters (2B/E, 2Bt and 3Bt horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Billyboy soils have a glossic horizon.  Horizonation has a wide range depending upon the thickness of the silty mantle and the extent to which eluviation has occured.  Therefore there can be E/B, B/E, 2E/B, or 2B/E horizons singularly or in combination, with or without Bt or 2Bt horizons.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
