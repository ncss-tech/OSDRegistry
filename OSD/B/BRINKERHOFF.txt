BRINKERHOFF SERIES

The Brinkerhoff series consists of very deep, well drained soils on fan terraces.  They formed in alluvium from sandstone and gypsiferous shale.  Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is about 56 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Brinkerhoff sandy loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 1 inch; brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak thin platy structure parting to weak fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick)

    A2--1 to 4 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak thick platy structure parting to weak fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 4 inches thick)

    Bt1--4 to 12 inches; yellowish red (5YR 4/6) sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common thin clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 14 inches thick)

    Bt2--12 to 17 inches; yellowish red (5YR 4/6) sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; common thin clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 5 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 19 inches thick)

    Bk--17 to 22 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) loamy sand, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; few very fine roots; common fine tubular pores; violently effervescent, few medium soft lime masses; common large krotovinas; 10 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 7 inches thick)

    By1--22 to 28 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) loamy sand, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable; few very fine roots; violently effervescent; common large krotovinas; few very fine gypsum crystals; 10 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 8 inches thick)

    2By2--28 to 50 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) and reddish brown (5YR 5/4) gravelly coarse sand, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable; many medium interstitial pores; violently effervescent; many sand size gypsum crystals; 30 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 22 inches thick)

    2By3--50 to 60 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) gravelly coarse sand, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; massive; loose; strongly effervescent; few sand size gypsum crystals; 15 percent small pebbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chacoan (NM), Delp (NV), Enos (WY), Granshaw (NV), Mayqueen (NM), Shiprock (NM), Wallson (WY) and Woolsey (NV) series.  These soils do not have a layer of gypsum above 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Brinkerhoff soils are on fan terraces at elevations of 4,600 to 5,l00 feet.  These soils formed in alluvium from sandstone and gypsiferous shale.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 7 to 11 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 55 to 57 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 165 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Grieta, Saido and Jocity soils.  Grieta and Jocity soils are fine-loamy.  Saido soils are coarse-silty.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff;  moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Brinkerhoff soils are used for livestock grazing.  The present vegetation is galleta, sand dropseed, blue grama and fourwing saltbush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Arizona.  This series is of small extent. MLRA 35.
