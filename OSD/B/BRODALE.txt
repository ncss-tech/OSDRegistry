BRODALE SERIES

The Brodale series consists of deep or very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in loamy residuum and colluvium that is derived mostly from dolomite or limestone bedrock. These soils are on plane or convex south-facing to west-facing valley sides on dissected uplands. Slope ranges from 6 to 90 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 833 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, mesic Entic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Brodale flaggy fine sandy loam, on a slightly convex, southwest-facing slope of 56 percent, on a valley side, in a native prairie, at an elevation of about 270 meters above sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

 A1--0 to 18 centimeters; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) flaggy fine sandy loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; about 25 percent rock fragments; neutral; clear smooth boundary. 

 A2--18 to 30 centimeters; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) flaggy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; about 25 percent rock fragments; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of A horizon is 12 to 50 centimeters.) 

 C1--30 to 51 centimeters; brown (10YR 4/3) very flaggy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) coats on faces of peds; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; about 50 percent rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. 

 C2--51 to 79 centimeters; olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) very flaggy loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; about 50 percent rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. 

 C3--79 to 152 centimeters; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) very flaggy loam; weak very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; about 50 percent rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  

TYPE LOCATION: Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) 105-Northern Mississippi Valley Loess Hills, Houston County, Minnesota subset; about 1/2 mile northeast of Freeburg; located about 1,300 feet east and 300 feet south of the northwest corner of section 30, T. 102 N., R. 4 W.; USGS Reno topographic quadrangle; lat. 43 degrees 36 minutes 54 seconds N. and long. 91 degrees 22 minutes 03 seconds W., NAD 83.

Rock fragment content--35 to 70 percent, dominantly dolomite or limestone flagstones, in some pedons channers may be dominant
Reaction--neutral to moderately alkaline 

Some pedons may have subhorizons with a rock fragment content of less than 35 percent 

The underlying bedrock is dolomite, limestone, or hard sandstone 

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--loamy residuum and colluvium that is derived mostly from dolomite or limestone bedrock
Landform--plane or convex south-facing to west-facing valley sides on dissected uplands
Slope--6 to 90 percent
Elevation--270 to 430 meters above sea level
Mean annual air temperature--8 to 11 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation--700 to 965 millimeters
Frost-free period--135 to 160 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Copaston, Lacrescent and Lamoille soils.
Copaston--are on slightly higher landscape positions and have a lithic contact of limestone within a depth of 50 centimeters
Lacrescent--are on landscape positions similar to that of the Brodale soils and have a cambic horizon
Lamoille--are at higher landscape positions on side slopes and have a clay content that averages 35 to 55 percent in the particle-size control section

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--excessively drained--a frequently saturated zone does not occur within a depth of 2 meters in normal years
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--1.00 to 100.00 micrometers per second in the loamy materials and 0.01 to 10.00 micrometers per second (in the bedrock depending on the amount of weathering
Surface runoff potential--medium to very high 

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are in native vegetation, but some areas are pastured. The native vegetation is big bluestem, little bluestem, sideoats grama, switchgrass, and other grasses of the tall and mid grass prairie.
