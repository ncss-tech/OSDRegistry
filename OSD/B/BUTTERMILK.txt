BUTTERMILK SERIES

The Buttermilk series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable saline soils on stream terraces in the Central Red Rolling Prairies (MLRA 80A).  They formed in silty alluvium.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 14.4 degrees C (58 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 762 mm (30 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, thermic Pachic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Buttermilk silt loam--native grass, at an elevation of 543 m (1780 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 in); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; hard, friable; many fine roots; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (Thickness of the A horizon ranges from 0 to 20 cm [0 to 8 in])

    Ay1--13 to 48 cm (5 to 19 in); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; hard, friable; many fine roots; common fine white salt crystals; slight effervescence; slightly saline; moderately alkaline, gradual smooth boundary.

    Ay2--48 to 71 cm (19 to 28 in); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium granular structure; hard, friable; few fine roots; common fine white salt crystals; strong effervescence; slightly saline; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (Thickness of the Ay horizon ranges from 15 to 64 cm [6 to 25 inches])

    Bwy--71 to 112 cm (28 to 44 in); light brown (7.5YR 6/4) silt loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; few fine roots; common fine white gypsum crystals; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (Thickness of the Bw horizon is 20 to 61 cm [8 to 24 in])

    Cy--112 to 155 (44 to 61 in); pink (7.5YR 7/4) silt loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist; massive; hard, friable; many fine white gypsum crystals; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  Dale is the only other series in the same family.  Soils in similar families are Corbin, Elandco, Pond Creek, Port, Reinach, St. Paul, and Westview series. 
All the competing series do not have saline characteristics  
Elandco and Port soils: have organic matter contents that decrease irregularly as depth increases and is more than 0.5 percent at a depth of 127 cm (50 in)  
Corbin, Pond Creek, St. Paul, and Westview soils: have an argillic horizon  
Reinach soils: have less than 18 percent clay in the control section

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: formed in silty alluvium
Landscape: alluvial plains
Landform: nearly level high stream terraces
Slope: 0 to 3 percent 
Mean annual precipitation: 737 to 787 mm (29 to 31 in)
Mean annual air temperature: 13.9 to 15 degrees C (57 to 61 degrees F)  
Frost-free period: 181 to 240 days
Elevation: 366 to 427 m (1200 to 1400 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Dale, Port, and Reinach series, and the Brewer, Canadian, Carey, Clairemont, Kingsdown, Lela, and McLain series.
Dale soils: do not have electrical conductivity above 2 mmhos/cm, and are on similar positions
Clairemont and Port soils: are on lower positions.  In addition, Clairemont soils do not have a mollic epipedon. 
Canadian and Reinach soils: are on slightly higher positions nearer to the stream.  In addition, Canadian soils have a mollic epipedon less than 51 cm (20 in) thick and have a coarse-loamy control section. 
Brewer, Lela, and McLain soils: are on slightly lower positions farther from the stream and have more than 35 percent clay in the control section
Carey and Kingsdown soils: are on convex side slopes, ridges, or knobs, and have a mollic epipedon less than 51 cm (20 in) thick

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage: Moderately well 
Runoff: negligible
Permeability: moderate
Flooding: rare

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are cultivated to wheat and grain sorghum.  Native vegetation is tall and mid grasses tolerant of salinity.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South central Kansas and north central Oklahoma.  LRR H; MLRA 80A. The soil is of small extent.
