BARGEVILLE SERIES

The Bargeville series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from quartzite.  These soils are on dip slopes, mountain slopes, and scarp slopes.  Slopes are 30 to 90 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 560 mm and annual air temperature is about 1 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Umbric Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Bargeville very gravelly loam, in forest land (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oe--0 to 7 cm; moderately decomposed plant material; strongly acid (pH 5.5); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 8 cm thick)

    A--7 to 24 cm; weak red (2.5YR 4/2), very gravelly loam, dusky red (2.5YR 3/2), moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 35 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 25 cm thick)

    AB--24 to 43 cm; reddish brown (2.5YR 4/3), very gravelly loam, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/3), moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 25 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 25 cm thick)

    Bt1--43 to 78 cm; reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4), very gravelly loam, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4), moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many fine roots; many fine vesicular pores; 10 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 35 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; very strongly acid (pH 4.5); gradual wavy boundary.

    Bt2--78 to 100 cm; reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4), very gravelly clay loam, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4), moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, firm, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many fine roots; many fine vesicular pores; 10 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 35 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; very strongly acid (pH 4.9); clear wavy boundary. (combined thickness of Bt horizons - 50 to 80 cm)

    BC--100 to 115 cm; red (2.5YR 4/6), very gravelly clay loam, dark red (2.5YR 3/6), moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very firm, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few fine vesicular pores; 50 percent gravel; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); abrupt irregular boundary. (10 to 25 cm thick)

    R--115 to 200 cm; very strongly cemented red quartzite bedrock.
