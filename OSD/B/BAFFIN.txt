BAFFIN SERIES

The Baffin series consists of very deep, subaqueous soils that formed in slightly fluid sandy and loamy estuarine sediments.  These nearly level soils are in shallow-water grass flats of bays and lagoons.  Water depth is generally less than 1.0 meter (3.28 ft).  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent but is mostly is less than 0.5 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 22.2 degrees C (72 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in).

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE:  Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Kenedy County, Texas, 2007. The name is from Baffin Bay in the survey area.

REMARKS:  The series was formerly included as areas of water.  The series was established based on the rooted vegetation that grows in certain bays.
The classification was changed from Sulfidic Haplowassents to Typic Hydrowassents due to lack of notation of sulfidic material present or the presence of odor on pedon descriptions or by field personnel, as well as n value.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle size control section: 25 to 102 cm (10 to 40 in). (Cg1, Cg2 and Cg3 horizons)
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 ins). (Ag1 and Ag2 horizons)
n-value more than 0.7: 0 to 58 cm (0 to 23 in). (Ag1, Ag2, Cg1 and Cg2 horizons)
Iron depletions: depleted matrix at 0 to 203 cm (0 to 80 in). (Ag1, Ag2, Cg1, Cg2, Cg3, Cg4, Cg5 and Cg6 horizons)
Peraquic feature: the zone from 0 to 152 cm (0 to 60 in) is permanently saturated. (Ag1, Ag2, Cg1, Cg2, Cg3 and Cg4 horizons)
Endosaturation: Permanently submerged.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  TAMU reference sample data for organic carbon from the type location S04TX-261-001, S04TX-261-002 and S04TX-261-003.  Particle-size analysis, salinity and sodicity tests on three pedons were performed at the soil survey project office.
