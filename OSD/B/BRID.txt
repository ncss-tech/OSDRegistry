BRID SERIES

The Brid series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and/or colluvium. These soils are on fan remnants, eroded fan remnants, and escarpments. Slopes are 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid, shallow Entic Durustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Brid gravelly loam, in pasture (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 30 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; 10 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (18 to 38 cm thick) 

    Bk--30 to 38 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) cobbly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; finely disseminated calcium carbonate, common fine calcium carbonate masses, and many distinct calcium carbonate coats on rock fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (8 to 25 cm thick)

    2Bkqm--38 to 69 cm; pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) dry and pink (7.5YR 7/3) moist; indurated silica-calcium carbonate cemented duripan; extremely hard; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (15 to 61 cm thick)

    3C--69 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) very gravelly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 45 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; finely disseminated carbonates; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).
