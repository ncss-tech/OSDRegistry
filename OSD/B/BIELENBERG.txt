BIELENBERG SERIES

The Bielenberg series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium and residuum derived from granitic and other coarse grained igneous rocks.  These soils are on bedrock-floored plains, mountains, and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.
