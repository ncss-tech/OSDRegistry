BOSTRUM SERIES



The Bostrum series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that

formed in residuum derived dominately from basalt.  Bostrum soils are

on basalt plains and have slopes of 0 to 20 percent.  Permeability is

very slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and

the average annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Typic Palexeralfs



TYPICAL PEDON:  Bostrum gravelly silt loam in rangeland.  (Colors are

for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)



    A--0 to 5 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly silt

loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium platy

structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly

plastic; many fine roots; many medium vesicular pores; 25 percent

pebbles on surface; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 6

inches thick)



    E--5 to 8 inches; light gray (10YR 7/1) silt loam; dark grayish

brown (10YR 4/2) moist; strong fine subangular blocky structure;

slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many

fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt

smooth boundary.  (0 to 3 inches thick)



    Bt1--8 to 13 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay, brown (10YR 4/3)

moist; strong fine and medium columnar structure parting to strong

medium angular blocky; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic;

common fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; continuous thick

dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) clay films on all faces of peds and in

the pores; continuous thick bleached white (N 8/) silt capping on top

of columns; mildly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 7

inches thick)



    Bt2--13 to 19 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay, brown (10YR 4/3)

moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to strong fine and

medium angular blocky; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common

fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; many moderately thick clay

films on all faces of peds and in the pores; mildly alkaline (pH 7.8);

clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)



    Bt3--19 to 29 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silty clay

loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; strong fine and medium angular blocky

structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine roots;

common very fine tubular pores; many moderately thick clay films on all

faces of peds and in the pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt

wavy boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)



    R--29 inches; basalt; lime-coated on surface.



TYPE LOCATION:  Camas County, Idaho; about 2.5 miles southwest of Magic

Reservoir; 150 feet east and 2,100 feet south of the northwest corner

of section 25 T. 2 S., R. 17 E.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series recognized in this

family.  Lostvalley is in a similar family.  Lostvalley soils are

frigid.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bostrum soils are on basalt plains and have slopes

of 0 to 20 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,400 to 5,000 feet.  The

soils formed in residuum derived dominately from basalt.  The annual

precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, most of which comes as fall and

winter snow and early spring rains.  Average annual air temperature is

45 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 60 to 110 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Adios, Gooding, Hamrub,

and Yutrue soils.  Adios soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a duripan.

Gooding soils have aridic moisture regime and are more than 40 inches

deep.  Hamrub soils are deep and have mollic epipedons.  Yutrue soils

are clayey to the surface.  Adios soils occur on buttes.  Gooding,

Hamrub, and Yutrue soils occur on the same landscape.  Hamrub soils are

on mounds.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, slow to rapid runoff; very

slow permeability.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for range.  Vegetation is Sandberg bluegrass,

bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, low sagebrush, alkali sagebrush,

and rabbitbrush.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South central Idaho.  This series is

inextensive.



MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Camas County, Idaho, 1977.



REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon

are:



Ochric epipedon - occurs from the soil surface to approximately 8

inches (A and E horizons)



Argillic horizon - is the zone from approximately 8 to 29 inches (Bt1,

Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).  There is  an absolute clay increase of 15

percent within the top 1 inch.
