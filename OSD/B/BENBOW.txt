BENBOW SERIES

The Benbow series consists of very deep, well drained soils, formed in alluvium from mixed sedimentary sources. Benbow soils are on stream terraces in mountain river valleys. Slope ranges from 2 to 9 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2030 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, isotic, thermic Andic Humixerepts

The soil has a xeric moisture regime.

Base Saturation: less than 50 percent by Ammonium Acetate throughout the soil profile

COMPETING SERIES: These are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Benbow soils are on uplifted stream terraces in mountain river valleys. Slopes are 2 to 9 percent. Elevations are 75 to 215 meters. These soils formed in  alluvium and some colluvium derived from mixed sedimentary sources. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers with a marine layer influenceand cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1250 to 2550 millimeters. Mean annual temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C. Frost free season is about 280 to 300 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Conklin (CA), Garberville (CA), Mattole (CA), and Parkland (CA) soils. Conklin, Garberville, Parkland, and Mattole soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section. greater than 50 percent base saturation by ammonium acetate throughout. Garberville and Parkland soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces. Conklin and Mattole soils are on stream terraces.. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; low runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used mainly for pasture. Natural vegetation includes annual and perennial grasses and forbs including sweet vernal grass  and bracken fern.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coastal Redwood Belt, MLRA 4B. The series is not extensive.
