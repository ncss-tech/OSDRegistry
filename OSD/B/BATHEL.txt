BATHEL SERIES

The Bathel series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils formed in loamy alluvium or eolian sediments of Pleistocene age. These soils occur on concave interdunal areas of the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 15.6 degrees C (60 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 in).

USE AND VEGETATION: The principle use is for cropland, and the main crop
is wheat or other small grains. Some areas are improved range and bermudagrass is the dominate species.
