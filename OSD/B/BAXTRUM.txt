BAXTRUM SERIES

The Baxtrum series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  These soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 12 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 610 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Baxtrum loam, on a west facing, simple, 30 percent slope in shrub cover at an elevation of 2,590 meters. When described on June 1, 1988 the soil was moist from 0 to 152 cm. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 10 cm; dark brown (10YR 3/3) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; common fine and very fine roots throughout; few fine and very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.

    A2--10 to 25 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; common fine and very fine roots throughout; few fine and very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.

    A3--25 to 36 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; common fine and very fine roots throughout; common fine and very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary.

    Bt1--36 to 48 cm brown (10YR 5/3) clay, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; common medium faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) lithochromic mottles; strong medium angular blocky structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; very hard, friable, very sticky, very plastic; common fine and very fine roots throughout; few fine and very fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary.

    Bt2--48 to 114 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clay, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) lithochromic mottles; strong medium angular blocky structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; very hard, friable, very sticky, very plastic; few fine and very fine roots throughout; common fine and very fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary. (combined thickness of the Bt1, Bt2 - 51 to 102 cm)

    C--114 to 152 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clay, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) lithochromic mottles; massive; very hard, friable, very sticky, very plastic; few fine and very fine roots throughout; 5 percent channers; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).
