BARTONFLAT SERIES

The Bartonflat series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in alluvium.  These soils are on river and fan terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  Permeability is rapid.  The average annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Calcidic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bartonflat very gravelly sandy loam--on a 4 percent slightly convex, east-facing slope at 6,335 feet elevation in rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on July 24, 1985 the soil was dry throughout).

	A--0 to 5 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine, and few medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine tubular and interstitial pores; 50 percent pebbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)

	AB--5 to 9 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium and coarse roots; common fine and medium interstitial pores; 65 percent pebbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 8 inches thick)

	Bk--9 to 18 inches; multicolored extremely gravelly loamy sand; single grain; loose; few very fine, fine and medium roots; common fine and medium interstitial pores; 70 percent pebbles, 5 percent cobbles; lime coatings, 1 to 3 mm thick on undersides and some sides or rock fragments; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5) gradual wavy boundary.  (7 to 12 inches thick)

	Bkq1--18 to 45 inches; multicolored extremely gravelly loamy sand; single grain; loose; few very fine and fine roots; common fine and medium interstitial pores; 65 percent pebbles, 20 percent cobbles; lime and silica coatings, 1 to 3 mm thick, on undersides and sides of rock fragments; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9) gradual wavy boundary.  (15 to 25 inches thick)

	Bkq2--45 to 60 inches; multicolored extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand; single grain; loose; few very fine roots; common fine and medium interstitial pores; 60 percent pebbles, 20 percent cobbles; lime and silica coatings, 1 to 3 mm thick, on undersides and sides of rock fragments; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7).

TYPE LOCATION:  Custer County, Idaho; at the borrow pit approximately 1 mile southeast of Chilly Buttes, about 2,200 feet north and 1,900 feet east from the southwest corner of section 32, T.9N., R.22E.  Latitude - 44 degrees, 03 minutes, 59 seconds North; Longitude - 113 degrees, 52 minutes, 46 seconds West.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Mean annual soil temperature - 39 to 43 degrees F.
Depth to calcic horizon - 7 to 11 inches with 5 to 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.
Depth to sand and gravel - 7 to 11 inches
Mollic epipedon - 7 to 11 inches thick
Control section - 5 to 12 percent clay, 55 to 90 percent rock fragments.

Bk horizon
Hue - 2.5Y or 10YR
Value - 3 or 4 moist
Chroma - 2 or 3 moist
Texture - GRV-SL, GRX-LS
Rock fragments - 45 to 75 percent
Reaction - slightly or moderately alkaline

Bkq horizon
Texture - GRX-LS, GRX-LCOS
Rock fragments - 65 to 85 percent
Reaction - slightly or moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bromaglin and Lesbut series.  Bromaglin soils have depth to sand and gravel at 14 to 24 inches.  Lesbut soils have sand and gravel at 10 to 20 inches and lack a calcic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bartonflat soils are on river and fan terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium.  The average annual precipitation is 7 to 12 inches.  Elevations are 4,500 to 6,600 feet.  The frost-free season is 50 to 90 days.  The average annual temperature is 37 to 41 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dickeypeak, Thosand and Whiteknob flood plains.  Whiteknob soils have an ochric epipedon.  Dickeypeak soils are coarse-loamy and calcareous to the soil surface.  Thosand soils are poorly drained and have an aquic moisture regime.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and irrigated hayland.  The vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeast Idaho.  The series is not extensive.
