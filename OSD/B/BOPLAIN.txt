BOPLAIN SERIES

The Boplain series consists of excessively drained soils which are moderately deep to a paralithic contact with sandstone.  They formed in eolian sand and sandy outwash on valley trains.  Permeability is rapid or very rapid in the sandy mantle and moderately slow or moderate in the sandstone.  Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, mesic Typic Udipsamments

TYPICAL PEDON:  Boplain sand - on a slope of less than 1 percent in cropland at 780 feet.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Ap--0 to 9 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) sand, brown (10YR 4/3) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; many fine and medium roots; 2 percent gravel; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. (6 to 10 inches thick)

   Bw1--9 to 15 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) sand; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; very friable; many fine and medium roots; 2 percent gravel; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.

   Bw2--15 to 27 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) sand; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; very friable; many fine and medium roots; 2 percent gravel; neutral; gradual smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the Bw horizon ranges from 10 to 25 inches)

   Bw3--27 to 32 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) coarse sand; single grain; loose; 2 percent gravel; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick)

   2C--32 to 37 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) sand; single grain; loose; 5 percent sandstone channers; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick)

   2Cr--37 to 44 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/8), yellowish brown (10YR 5/8), and yellow (10YR 7/6) moderately cemented sandstone bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Pepin County, Wisconsin; about 3 miles northeast of Durand; 1430 feet south and 700 feet west of the northeast corner of sec. 11, T. 25 N., R. 13 W.; Latitude: 44 degrees 39 minutes  53 seconds N; Longitude: 91 degrees 54 minutes  52 seconds W

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the paralithic contact with sandstone ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the sandy outwash.  Volume of sandstone channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the sandy residuum.

The Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 1 to 3.  Some pedons have an A horizon with value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  The Ap or A horizon is sand.  Reaction naturally ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid but ranges to neutral in Ap horizons where the soil is limed.

Some pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 or 3. It is sand, coarse sand, loamy coarse sand, or loamy sand.

The Bw horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, and value and chroma of 3 to 6.  Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together.  The Bw horizons are sand, coarse sand, loamy coarse sand, or loamy sand.  Bw horizons with spodic color have less than 0.6 percent organic carbon.

The 2C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 3 to 8.  

The 2Cr and 2R horizons have colors like the 2C horizon described above.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Acquando(T), Aldo, Biltmore, Caesar, Chute, Dabney, Hodge, Oakville, Pahuk(T), Penwood, Perks, Pinewood, Plainfield, Sardak, Sarpy, Scotah, Spessard, Suncook, Tyner, and Windsor series.  None of these soils have a paralithic contact within the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Boplain soils typically are on sand sheets that mantle valley trains.  Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent.  These soils formed in  20 to 40 inches of eolian sand and sandy outwash overlying sandstone.  Some pedons have the lower part of the solum or the substratum formed in sandy residuum from the underlying siliceous sandstone.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 51 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 135 to 160 days.  Elevation ranges from 600 to 1000 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Near the Type Location these are the Elevasil, Farrington, Finchford, Komro, and Plainfield series.  The well drained Elevasil soils are on nearby hills and formed in a loamy eolian or slope alluvium mantle over siliceous sandy residuum and are underlain by sandstone bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  The somewhat poorly drained Farrington soils, the moderately well drained Komro, and the excessively drained Plainfield and Finchford soils, formed in more than 60 inches of sandy outwash on nearby positions on valley trains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Excessively drained.  Surface runoff is slow to very rapid.  Permeability is rapid in the sandy mantle and moderately slow or moderate in the sandstone.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas with slopes less than 6 percent are used for cropland.  Corn, soybeans, small grain, and hay are the principal crops.  Most of the steeper areas are used for woodland or pastureland.  Native vegetation is mixed deciduous and pine forest.  Common trees are northern pin oak and jack pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  West-central Wisconsin.  MLRA K91 inclusion in M105.  The series is of small extent to date, but it is anticipated that as soil surveys are updated, the acreage may increase to moderately extensive in Wisconsin.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Pepin County, Wisconsin, 1998.

REMARKS:  Prior to 1996, Boplain soils were mapped as the Plainbo series which is the frigid temperature regime counterpart.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - 0 to 9 inches thick (Ap); paralithic contact - 37 inches (2Cr).
