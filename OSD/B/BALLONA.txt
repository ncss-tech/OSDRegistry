BALLONA SERIES


The Ballona series consists of well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources. Ballona soils are on alluvial fans, inset fans, and floodplains. Slopes are 0 to 9 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 445 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C.

REMARKS:

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - the zone form a depth of 0 to 70 cm
Human transported material - the zone from a depth of 0 to 30 cm
Secondary calcium carbonate - the zone from a depth of 90 to 200 cm
Particle-size control section - the zone from a depth of 30 to 100 cm

Some pedons that do not have calcium carbonate are included in the concept during the mapping of the southeastern Part of Los Angeles County.
