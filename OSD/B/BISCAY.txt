BISCAY SERIES

The Biscay series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of loamy glacial outwash and the underlying calcareous sandy and gravelly glacial outwash.  These soils are on concave or slightly convex positions on glacial outwash plains, till plains, valley trains, stream terraces and flood plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters.  The mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C.

Mayer--are at similar landscape positions as the Biscay soils and have carbonates in all layers between depths of 25 and 50 centimeters
Wadena--are at higher landscape positions and do not have a frequently saturated zone within a depth of 1.8 meters during the wettest periods of normal years

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--very poorly or poorly drained--these soils are frequently saturated at the soil surface during the wettest periods of normal years and this saturation is considered apparent
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--1.00 to 10.00 micrometers per second in the loamy sediments and 10.00 to 100.00 micrometers per second in the underlying materials
Surface runoff potential--negligible to low
Ponding--rarely to frequently ponded for very brief to long duration

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are artificially drained and cultivated. The principal crops are corn, soybeans, small grains, and legume hay. Reed canarygrass commonly dominates partially drained pasture. Native vegetation is predominantly wet-site tall prairie species such as prairie cordgrass, switchgrass, big bluestem, wooly sedge, giant goldenrod and Canada goldenrod. The native vegetation on very poorly drained ponded phases is herbaceous marsh species tolerant of excessive wetness such as, cattails, bulrushes, giant burreed, giant reed grass and hydrophytic sedges.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: McLeod County, Minnesota, 1948.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 51 centimeters (Ap, A1 and A2 horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 51 to 71 centimeters (Bg1, Bg2 and BCg horizons);
aquic moisture regime--a positive reaction with alpha, alpha-dipyridyl is assumed.

Cation-exchange class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
