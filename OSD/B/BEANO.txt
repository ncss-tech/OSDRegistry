BEANO SERIES

The Beano series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Beano soils are on fan remnants and ballenas.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 130 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Argidic Argidurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Beano loamy coarse sand--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 8 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy coarse sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak thick platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 10 cm thick)

    A2--8 to 18 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many fine and medium and common very fine roots; many fine interstitial and common very fine and fine vesicular pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 15 cm thick)

    Bt--18 to 33 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine interstitial and common very fine and fine tubular pores; 35 percent gravel; common moderately thick clay films on peds; slightly effervescent; few fine lime filaments in tubular pores; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 20 cm thick)

    Btqk--33 to 46 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial and common fine tubular pores; 40 percent gravel, common thin clay bridges between grains; violently effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 15 cm thick)

    Bqkm--46 to 89 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) cemented material, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; alternating massive and single grain; very hard, extremely firm, brittle; strongly cemented with weakly cemented and noncemented interbedded layers; common fine and medium roots; few fine tubular pores; 40 percent gravel; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) discontinuous indurated silica laminae in pores and bridging some gravel, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist; violently effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.5); gradual smooth boundary.  (25 to 50 cm thick)

    2Bk--89 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) stratified extremely gravelly coarse sand and extremely gravelly loamy sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 65 percent gravel; violently effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Beano soils are on fan remnants and ballenas.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Elevation ranges from 1,675 to 1,890 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Izo and Hollywell soils.  Both of these soils lack an argillic horizon and Izo soils are sandy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Beano soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is mainly Bailey's greasewood, bud sagebrush, galleta, shadscale, Nevada ephedra, Indian ricegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  West-central Nevada.  These soils are not extensive with about 4,600 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 27.
