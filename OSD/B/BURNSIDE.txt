BURNSIDE SERIES

The Burnside series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in 30 to 61 centimeters (12 to 24 inches) of medium-textured alluvium and the underlying loamy-skeletal alluvium. These soils are on flood plains and alluvial fans. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1168 millimeters (46 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (56 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, active, mesic Fluventic Dystrudepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Burnside silt loam in a nearly level to undulating, narrow flood plain in a bedrock-controlled upland, at an elevation of about 145 meters (475 feet) above sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

	A1--0 to 10 centimeters (0 to 4 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam; weak fine granular structure; friable; commom pebbles and cobbles; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. 

	A2--10 to 20 centimeters (4 to 8 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silt loam; weak fine platy structure; friable; few gravel and sandstone flagstones; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. 

	Bw1--20 to 43 centimeters (8 to 17 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silt loam; weak very fine and fine granular and weak very fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few sandstone flagstones and gravel; very strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.

	2Bw2--43 to 84 centimeters (17 to 33 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) extremely flaggy loam; common medium faint light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) mottles; fine weak subangular blocky structure in the fine earth part; friable; about 75 percent of this layer is larger than 2 mm and consists of sandstone fragments and common iron-manganese concretions; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.

	2C--84 to 145 centimeters (33 to 57 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) extremely flaggy loam; common medium faint light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) mottles; massive; friable; about 80 percent of this layer is larger than 2 mm and consists of sandstone fragments and common iron-manganese concretions; somewhat cemented when dry; strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.

	2R--145 to 152 centimeters (57 to 60 inches); sandstone bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION: Johnson County, Illinois; approximately 4 miles southeast of Vienna, about 1,280 feet east and 1,100 feet south of the center of sec. 14, T. 13 S., R. 3 E.; USGS Bloomfield, IL topographic quadrangle; lat. 37 degrees 23 minutes 18 seconds N. and long. 88 degrees 50 minutes 46 seconds W.; UTM Zone 16, Easting 336576, Northing 4139536, NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Thickness of loamy alluvium: 30 to 61 centimeters (12 to 24 inches)
Depth to the base of the cambic horizon: 40 to 102 centimeters (16 to 40 inches) 
Depth to lithic contact: 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 80 inches) 
Reaction: strongly acid or very strongly acid 

A and Bw horizons:
Hue=10YR
Value=4 to 6
Chroma=2 to 4
Fine-earth texture=silt loam or loam
Total content of rock fragments=0 to 35 percent gravel 

2Bw horizon:
Hue=10YR
Value=4 to 6
Chroma=2 to 4
Fine-earth texture=silt loam or loam
Total content of rock fragments=25 to 80 percent 

2C horizon:
Hue=10YR
Value=4 or 5
Chroma=3 or 4
Fine-earth texture=loam, silt loam, or sandy loam
Total content of rock fragments=50 to 90 percent 
The rock fragments mainly consist of thin, flat, fragments of sandstone ranging in size from 2.5 to more than 38 centimeters (an inch to over 15 inches) in length and 1 to 7 centimeters (1/2 to 3 inches) thick.

2R horizon:
Hard sandstone bedrock

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Beanblossom and Trestle series. Beanblossom soils are 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches) to a paralithic contact and have a reaction of moderately acid to neutral in one or more horizons in the particle-size control section. Trestle soils are more than 152 centimeters (60 inches) to a lithic or paralithic contact and have a reaction of moderately acid or slightly acid in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Burnside soils are on narrow flood plains and alluvial fans in valleys of sandstone hills. Slope gradients range from 0 to 4 percent. Burnside soils formed in 12 to 24 inches of silty and loamy alluvium over loamy fragmental sediments. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 1168 millimeters (29 to 46 inches) and mean annual temperature ranges from 12 to 14 degrees C (54 to 57 degrees F). Elevation ranges from 104 to 311 meters (340 to 1020 feet) above mean sea level. Frost free period is 170 to 210 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Burnside soils are mainly associated with Sharon soils on the alluvial landforms and Wellston, Zanesville, Berks and Muskingum soils on the adjacent uplands. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The potential for surface water runoff is negligible to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/s). Permeability is moderate (0.6 to 2 inches/hour). An intermittent apparent high water table, where present, is at a depth of more than 102 centimeters (3.5 feet). 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used as pasture or woodland. Some areas are cleared and used as cropland. Native vegetation is deciduous hardwoods. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Illinois and southern Indiana. Extent is small in MLRA 120A, 120B and 122. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Johnson County, Illinois, 1954. 

REMARKS: CEC activity class was assigned as active and horizon nomenclature was updated 8/03/2001. The classification was changed from Oxyaquic Dystrudepts to Fluventic Dystrudepts with the 12/2007 revision.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are 1) Ochric epipedon: the zone from 0 to 20 centimeters (0 to 8 inches) (A1 and A2 horizons); 2) Cambic horizon: the zone from 20 to 84 centimeters (8 to 33 inches) (Bw1, 2Bw2 horizons); and 3) Lithic contact at 145 centimeters (57 inches).
