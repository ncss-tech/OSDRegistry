COMPETING SERIES: These are the Basaltlake, Cuberant, Enentah, Garlet, Gromes, Soakpak, Storm, Targhee, and Telay series. Cuberant, Firada, Targhee soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Butchlake soils have buried A horizons and mottles in the substratum. Enentah soils are somewhat excessively drained. Garlet soils are calcareous in the substratum. Gromes and Storm soils have greater than 10 percent clay in the particle size control section. Soakpak soils have a mean annual soil temperature less than 32 degrees F. Telay soils have a presummed cooler mean summer soil temperature.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loess over till
Landform: glacial hills
Slope: 0 to 30 percent
Mean annual temperature: 24 to 28 degrees F., -4.4 to -2.2 C.
Mean annual precipitation: 12 to 15 inches, 305 to 381 mm.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Nomercy Lake and Southpaw series. Nomercy Lake soils have a pergelic temperature regime. Southpaw has a thicker loess mantle and fewer coarse fragments in the control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderate runoff. Permeability is moderate in the loamy surface soil, moderately rapid in the very gravelly subsoil.

USE AND VEGETATION: The native vegetation includes black spruce forest with scrub birch and lichen understory.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 228, Interior Alaska Mountains, The series is of moderate extent.
