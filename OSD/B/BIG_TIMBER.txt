BIG TIMBER SERIES

The Big Timber series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from shale or interbedded shale and sandstone. They are on hills. Slopes are 8 to 35 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, mixed, superactive, frigid, shallow Entic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Big Timber clay loam, native grass. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

A--O to 3 inches, reddish brown (5YR 5/3) clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick)

Bw--3 to 6 inches, weak red (2.5YR 4/2) clay loam, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/3) moist; moderate very fine angular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; 5 percent clay shale fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (1 to 4 inches thick)

C1--6 to 18 inches, weak red (2.5YR 5/2) clay, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) moist; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; 10 percent clay shale fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (O to 20 inches thick)

Cr--18 to 60 inches, reddish very fine grained sandstone, siltstone and clay shale; common threads of lime segregation on lower side of shale fragments and a few threads of lime in old root channels; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

COMPETING SERIES:

There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - hills
Eelevation - 3,200 to 5,000 feet. 
Parent material - material weathered from shale and interbedded sandstone and shale. 
Mean annual precipitation - 12 to 18 inches.
Mean annual temperature - 38 to 45 F.
Fost-free period - 105 to 135 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly as native range. Vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, needleandthread grass, and Sandberg bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Montana and adjacent portionS of Wyoming. Big Timber soils are of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Judith Basin Area, Montana, 1963.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: a mollic epipedon from the surface to 7 inches (mixed) (A and Bw horizons); a paralithic contact at 18 inches (Cr horizon). Big Timber soils have an ustic moisture regime and a frigid temperature regime.
