BONESPRING SERIES

The Bonespring series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in loamy residuum and colluvium weathered from Permian sandstone bedrock. Bonespring soils are on hilly to very steep hills, mountains and escarpments. Slopes are 10 to 60 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 411 mm (16 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, thermic Aridic Lithic Ustorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Bonespring very gravelly sandy loam, on a south-facing 31 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 1,711 m (5613 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).                  

    A1--0 to 9 cm (0 to 4 in); light brown (7.5YR 6/3) very channery sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3), moist; weak fine and medium granular structure; soft, friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; 5 percent very angular strongly cemented 150 to 250 mm sandstone fragments and 50 percent very angular strongly cemented 5 to 150 mm sandstone fragments; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.

    A2--9 to 28 cm (4 to 11 in); light brown (7.5YR 6/4) extremely channery sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4), moist; weak fine granular structure; loose, loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; 5 percent very angular strongly cemented 150 to 250 mm sandstone fragments and 70 percent flat very angular strongly cemented 5 to 150 mm sandstone fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizon is 8 to 42 cm [3 to 17 in])

    R--28 to 53 cm (11 to 21 in); strongly cemented sandstone bedrock; common very fine and fine roots at top of layer.
