BOTTLE SERIES

The Bottle series consists of well to excessively drained soils formed in acid, coarse-textured materials weathered from sandstone bedrock.  Bottle soils are on gently sloping to steeply sloping hills, ridges, and mountains.  Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 1 degrees C.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed Typic Dystrocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bottle sandy loam - forest.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 3 cm; undecomposed organic material principally needles, bark, and twigs.

    Oe--3 to 6 cm; partially decomposed organic material like that of the horizon above; very strongly acid.

    E--6 to 21 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) sandy loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; weak very thick platy structure that parts to medium granules; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; very strongly acid (pH 4.6); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 25 cm thick)

    Bw--21 to 41 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; few dark colored concretions; very strongly acid (pH 4.9); abrupt wavy boundary.  (15 to 80 cm thick)

    C--41 to 71 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loamy fine sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; single grained; loose; very strongly acid (pH 4.9); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 81 cm thick)

    R--71 to 107 cm; hard Dakota sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION:  Grand County, Colorado; approximately SE , SW  of sec. 3, T. 2 S., R. 76 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
These soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section at some time in most years.
Base saturation--30 to 60 percent
Depth to lithic contact--50 to 100 cm
Depth to base of cambic horizon--20 to 60 cm
Very thin dark colored A horizons occur above the albic (E) horizon in some pedons.  

Particle-size control section:
Texture in the upper part, including the cambic horizon--sandy loam, but clay ranges from 4 to 18 percent and sand from 52 to 80 percent with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Textures coarser than loamy very fine sand are excluded from the above ranges.
Texture in the lower part--loamy sand or sand, and is thick enough to dominate the control section so that on a weighted average basis the soil belongs in a sandy family.  
Rock fragment content--0 to 35 percent, mainly 10 to 250 mm in diameter
A majority of subhorizons above the bedrock have hue of 7.5YR or yellower, although in some pedons subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur.

E horizon
Hue--5 through 7.5YR
Value--5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist
Chroma--1 through 6
Reaction--pH 4.5 to 5.5

Bw horizon
Hue--5Y through 5YR
Value--5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist
Chroma--1 through 6
Clay content--4 to 18 percent
Sand content--52 to 80 percent with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand
Texture--sandy loam
Reaction--pH 4.5 to 5.5 

C horizon
Hue--5Y through 7.5YR
Reaction--pH 4.5 to 5.5

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chromose, Goldhill, and Leal series.  Chromose soils have no bedrock above a depth of 100 cm and are more than 60 percent base saturated.  Goldhill and Leal soils have moderately coarse textured control sections.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform--gently to steeply sloping hills, ridges, and mountainsides
Elevation--1925 to 3000 meters
Slope--2 to 40 percent or more
Parent material--moderately thin, acid, coarse-textured materials weathered from sandstone bedrock
Mean annual precipitation--660 mm with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer months
Mean annual air temperature--1 degrees C
Mean summer air temperature--8 degrees C

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well to excessively drained; slow to very slow runoff; rapid to very rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used as grazing land, for recreation, and for timber production.  Native vegetation is spruce, fir, lodgepole pine, vaccinium, and snowberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Bottle soils are moderately extensive in northcentral and northwestern Wyoming; MLRA 43B.
