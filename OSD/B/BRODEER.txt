BRODEER SERIES

The Brodeer series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and/or colluvium from granitic or metamorphic rock with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. Some profiles have an admixture of loess. They are on mountain side slopes, hills, and ridges. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high and slopes range from 3 to 75 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Brodeer soils are on mountain side slopes, hills, and ridges at elevations of 1,600 to 5,200 feet (488 to 1585 meters) with slopes of 3 to 75 percent. These soils are formed in residuum and/or colluvium from granitic or metamorphic rock with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. The average annual temperature is 38 to 45 degrees F. and the average precipitation is 30 to 55 inches (762 to 1397 mm). The frost free season is 50 to 120 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brequito and Mushel series. Brequito soils are on mountain side slopes and summits. They have 3BC or 3C horizons and a thin volcanic ash mantle. Brequito soils are on mountain side slopes and have thin volcanic ash mantles. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, watershed, and recreation. Potential natural vegetation is western red cedar, grand fir, western hemlock, western larch, western white pine, Douglas-fir, and ponderosa pine, with an understory of wild ginger, queencup beadlily, coolwort foamflower, pioneer violet, princes pine, and fools huckleberry. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North Central Idaho and eastern Washington. Brodeer soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 43A.
