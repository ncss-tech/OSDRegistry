BRODYK SERIES

The Brodyk series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess.  These soils are on relict stream terraces.  Slopes are 4 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Calciustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Brodyk silt loam in cropland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise indicated).

    Ap--0 to 6 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 7 inches thick)

    Bk1--6 to 30 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary. (15 to 25 inches thick)

    Bk2--30 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; dissemenated lime; few fine seams of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - relict stream terraces.
Elevation - 4,600 to 5,700 feet.
Parent material - loess.
Slope - 4 to 45 percent.
Climate - long cold winters; moist springs; warm summers.
Mean annual precipitation - 14 to 18 inches.
Mean annual air temperature - 39 to 43 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 90 to 110 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Brodyk soils are used mainly for nonirrigated cropland.  The potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, western wheatgrass, and prairie junegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Brodyk soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Gallatin County, Montana, 1997.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record: MT1445.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an  ochric epipedon from the surface to 6 inches (Ap horizon); a calcic horizon from 6 to 60 inches (Bk1, Bk2 horizons); a coarse-silty particle size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bk1, Bk2 horizons).  Brodyk soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
