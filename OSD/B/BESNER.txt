BESNER SERIES

The Besner series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are mainly on mounds and formed in alluvial sediments on Pleistocene terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C (66 degrees F); mean annual precipitation is about 1168 mm (46 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Typic Glossudalfs

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Besner soils are well drained and moderately permeable.  Runoff is negligible on slopes of 0 to 3 percent and very low on 3 to 5 percent slopes.     

USE AND VEGETATION:  Besner soils are used mainly for pastureland and forestland.  Pastures are improved bermuda, common bermuda or bahiagrass that are commonly overseeded with various legumes including crimson clover, vetch or singletary peas.   Native vegetation consists of loblolly and shortleaf pines mixed with various oaks and sweetgum trees.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  On the Western Coastal Plain in East Texas, Louisiana and possibly Arkansas (MLRA 133B); Land Resource Region: East Texas Timberlands; MLRA 133B; The series is of moderate extent.
