BRAZON SERIES

The Brazon series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in clayey alluvium and colluvium derived from limestone and calcareous shales. These soils are on uplands and mountain foot slopes and fans. Slopes range from 2 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 510 mm, and mean annual temperature is 5.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Calciustolls

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Brazon soils are on uplands, mountain foot slopes, and fans and have gradients of 2 to 45 percent. Elevations are 4000 to 5020 feet. Brazon soils formed in clayey alluvium and colluvium derived from limestone and calcareous shales. The climate is cool with long cold winters and moist springs and summers. Mean annual precipitation is 19 to 24 inches. Mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. The growing season is 90 to 110 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The associated Loken and Winifred soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to rapid runoff; slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Brazon soil are used mainly for rangeland. To a lesser extent they are used for cropland and pasture. The potential native vegetation is mainly rough fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, Columbia needlegrass, western wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, forbs, and shrubs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Brazon soils are of limited extent in the foothills area of central Montana.
