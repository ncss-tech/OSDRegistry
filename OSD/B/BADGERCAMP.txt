BADGERCAMP SERIES

The Badgercamp series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from soft tuffaceous bedrock.  Badgercamp soils are on plateaus and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, shallow Xeric Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Badgercamp loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered with about 2 percent boulders and 10 percent cobbles and gravel.

    A1--0 to 5 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate thin platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 2 percent boulders and 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 13 cm thick)

    A2--5 to 23 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak thin platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 28 cm thick)

    Bt--23 to 48 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 65 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 2 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (23 to 28 cm thick)

    Cr--48 cm; tuffaceous bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Humboldt County, Nevada; about 28 miles east-northeast of Vya and 1 mile southwest of Badgercamp on the Sheldon National Wildlife Refuge; in a nonsectionized area near the projected southwest corner of section 18, T. 43 N., R. 24 E.; USGS Blowout Mountain 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 41 degrees 38 minutes 15 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 19 minutes 14 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 41.6375000 latitude, -119.3194444 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist in winter, spring, and early summer, dry mid-July through early October; xeric soil moisture regime that borders on aridic.
Mean annual soil temperature: 4 to 6 degrees C.
Mean summer soil temperature: 12 to 15 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 18 to 38 cm; includes the Bt horizon in some pedons.
Depth to bedrock: 36 to 50 cm to a paralithic contact. The paralithic materials below the contact are soft bedrock such as tuff and tuffaceous sandstone.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 12 to 18 percent.
Rock fragments: 40 to 80 percent, mainly gravel larger than 5 mm. Lithology of fragments are volcanic rocks such as tuff and basalt.

A horizons
Value: 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.
Organic matter content: 2 to 4 percent.

Bt horizon
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 2 through 4, dry or moist.
Texture: Very gravelly loam or extremely gravelly loam.
Consistence:  Very friable or friable, nonsticky or slightly sticky, nonplastic or slightly plastic.
Organic matter content: 1 or 2 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bakscratch and Hiridge series.

Bakscratch soils are shallow to paralithic contacts of granitic rock and have dominantly fine gravel in the particle-size control section.  Hiridge soils have 25 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section, have mean annual soil temperature of 6 to 8 degrees C, and are intermittently moist in some part of the moisture control section for 10 to 20 days cumulative during summer months due to convection storms.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Badgercamp soils are on plateaus and mountains.  They typically occur on summit and shoulder positions.  They formed in residuum derived from soft tuffaceous bedrock.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,800 to 2,400 meters.  The climate is subhumid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 500 mm, the mean annual temperature is 3 to 5 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 40 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Bearbutte soil.  Bearbutte soils are coarse-loamy, deep to paralithic contacts, have argillic horizons and thick Mollic epipedons, and have a frigid temperature regime.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high or very high surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Badgercamp soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly curl-leaf mountainmahogany, mountain big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, and needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive with about 3,600 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 23.
