BINVAR SERIES 

The Binvar series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium and have extremely gravelly loamy sand at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  These soils are on flood plains, alluvial fans, and low stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aeric Calciaquolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Binvar cobbly loam, in grassland (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 inch to 0.5 inch; undecomposed root mat.

(4 to 8 inches thick) 

    Bk1--7 to 13 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) dry; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium and fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel; continuous distinct lime casts on undersides of gravel; disseminated lime; common fine masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual smooth boundary.

(0 to 6 inches thick) 

    2Bk4--25 to 37 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) extremely gravelly sandy loam, white (10YR 8/2) dry; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; 45 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; disseminated lime; many fine masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual smooth boundary. (combined thickness of 2Bk horizons is 8 to 20 inches) 

    3C--37 to 60 inches; dark brown (10YR 4/3) extremely gravelly loamy sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 50 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lewis and Clark County Area, Montana, 1991; proposed in Lewis and Clark County, Montana 1989.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation records:  MT1232.  

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

Mollic epipedon - from 0 to 7 inches (mixed)(A, Bk1 horizons)
Calcic horizons - from 7 to 37 inches (Bk1, 2Bk2, 2Bk3, 2Bk4)
Lithological discontinuity - extremely gravelly loamy sand from 37 to 60 inches (3C horizon)
Particle size control section -from 10 to 40 inches (part of the Bk1,the 2Bk2, 2Bk3, 2Bk4, and part of the 3C horizon). 

Binvar soils have a frigid temperature and an aquic moisture regime. 

The Binvar series should be evaluated to fix the discrepancies in the Munsell color code vs. the true names.
