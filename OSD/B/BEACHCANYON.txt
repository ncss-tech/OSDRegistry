BEACHCANYON SERIES

The Beachcanyon series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or landslide deposits. These soils are on mountain slopes and landslides. Slopes are 10 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 559 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 3.3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, mixed, superactive Pachic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Beachcanyon stony loam, on a west facing, 22 percent slope in aspen at an elevation of 2,798 meters. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oe--0 to 5 cm; moderately decomposed leaves and twigs; abrupt smooth boundary

    A1--5 to 18 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) stony loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine, very fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary.

    A2--18 to 50 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) stony loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots, and common medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.(combined thickness of A horizons is 40 to 60 cm)

    Bt1--50 to 68 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very stony clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine and medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and medium, and few coarse roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds and on surfaces along pores; 5 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles, and 20 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary.

    Bt2--68 to 109 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very stony clay, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine and medium roots; common fine tubular pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds and on surfaces along pores; 10 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles, and 30 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary. (combined thickness of Bt horizons is 50 to 90 cm)

    BC--109 to 152 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very stony clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and medium roots; 15 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles, and 25 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.8).
