BRUNELDA SERIES

The Brunelda series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material derived from semiconsolidated shale.  These soils are on sedimentary plains.  Slopes are 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Torrertic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Brunelda silty clay, grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 1 inch; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silty clay loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many very fine roots; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick)

    Bw--1 to 6 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silty clay, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure parting to moderate fine and very fine angular blocky; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine pores; few fine masses of lime in lower part; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 7 inches thick)

    Byz1--6 to 13 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silty clay, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium angular blocky; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine pores; many fine masses of gypsum and other salts; slightly effervescent; mildly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick)

    Byz2--13 to 40 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine pores; common fine masses of gypsum and other salts; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); gradual smooth boundary. (10 to 30 inches thick)

    BC--40 to 60 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine pores; mildly alkaline (pH 7.6).
