BELLEHELEN SERIES

The Bellehelen series consists of shallow or very shallow well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Bellehelen soils are on hills and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Lithic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bellehelen very cobbly loam, woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The surface is covered with 35 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones.

    A--0 to 13 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium platy structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine vesicular pores; 30 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles and 3 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 25 cm thick)

    Bt--13 to 28 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine to medium roots; common fine tubular pores; common thin clay films on faces of ped, lining pores and coating rock fragments; 45 percent gravel and 10 percent stones, neutral (pH 7.3); clear wavy boundary.  (13 to 25 cm thick)

    R--28 cm; hard andesitic tuff, weathered in the upper 10 cm.

TYPE LOCATION:  Nye County, Nevada; Kawich Range, Stone Cabin Valley, approximately 2,200 feet north and 1,100 feet west of the southeast corner of section 24, T. 1 N., R. 48 E.; Stinking Spring USGS 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 37 degrees 54 minutes 35.8 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 30 minutes 42.2 W; UTM 11, 542921e, 4195935n; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 37.9101111 latitude, -116.5119444  longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in winter and spring, dry summer and fall except for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July to October due to convection storms; xeric soil moisture regime bordering on aridic.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 12 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 18 to 25 cm (some pedons must be mixed to 18 cm to qualify as mollic).
Depth to bedrock: 18 to 36 cm.
Reaction: Neutral or slightly alkaline.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  Averages 18 to 35 percent.
Rock fragments:  35 to 60 percent.

A horizon 
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.

Bt horizon
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4.
Texture:  Loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam, and may include subhorizons with greater than 35 percent clay.
Rock fragments: 35 to 60 percent, mainly gravel.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Argabak, Brier, Duco, Horseflat, Nuhelen, Ocud, Orhood, Reywat, and Upatad series. 

Argabak, Duco, Ocud, Orthood and Reywat do not have the 10 to 20 days of summer moisture.  Brier soils are 36 to 50 cm to bedrock. Horseflat soils have a mollic epipedon 30 to 43 cm thick and do not have the 10 to 20 days of summer moisture.   Upatad soils are 36 to 50 cm to bedrock and the lower part of the Bt horizon contains more than 60 percent gravel and cobbles. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Bellehelen soils are on hills and mountain slopes.  They formed in residuum and colluvium from volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 1,600 to 2,900 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C; and the frost-free season is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Stewval, and Zadvar series.  Stewval and Zadvar have less organic matter and Zadvar soils have a strongly cemented hardpan. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained, high and very high runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Woodland.  Present vegetation is mainly singleleaf pinyon Utah juniper with an understory of pine bluegrass, black sagebrush, ephedra, rabbitbrush, snowberry and small amounts of mountain big sagebrush, and desert bitterbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Nevada.  These soils are of small extent.  MLRA 29.
