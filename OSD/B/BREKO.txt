BREKO SERIES

The Breko series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Breko soils are on fan remnants, fan piedmonts and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bairs, Basket, Chiefrange, Cowgil, Drino, Hefed, Huilepass, Hunewill, Jungo, Kayo, Lithgow, Plush, Schader, Stucky and Washoe series.  

Bairs, Basket, Chiefrange, Cowgil, Drino, Hefed, Huilepass, Hunewill, Jungo, Kayo, Lithgow, Plush, Stucky and Washoe soils lack free carbonates in the A and upper part of the Bt. Bairs soils contain stones and boulders in the particle-size control section. Chiefrange, Cowgil, Drino, Hefed, Huilepass, Hunewill, Jungo, Kayo, Lithgow, Plush, Stucky, and Washoe soils have mean annual soil temperatures less than 13 degrees C. Schader soils are moderately deep to bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Breko soils are on fan remnants, fan piedmonts and alluvial fans. These soils formed in alluvium from mixed rocks, mainly volcanic tuff with minor amounts of limestone and quartzite.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 1.460 to 1,980 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool moist winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 120 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Handpah, Veet and Wiskiflat series.  Handpah soils are shallow over indurated duripans.  Veet and Wiskiflat soils do not have argillic horizons. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, shadscale, spiny hopsage, ephedra, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 29, 30.
