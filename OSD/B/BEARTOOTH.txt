BEARTOOTH SERIES 

The Beartooth series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from limestone and argillite bedrock.  These soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 25 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Beartooth loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless noted otherwise).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 

Landform - mountains. 
Elevation - 4,500 to 5,200 feet. 
Slope - 25 to 60 percent. 
Parent material - colluvium derived from limestone and argillite bedrock. 
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm summers. 
Mean annual precipitation - 15 to 22 inches. 
Mean annual temperature - 38 to 43 degrees F. 
Frost-free period - 90 to 110 days. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Beartooth soils are used mainly for range, grazing, and wildlife habitat.  They have potential for timber production.  The native vegetation is mainly Douglas fir and ponderosa pine trees with an understory of pinegrass, mallow ninebark, Engelmann aster, white spiraea, common snowberry, heartleaf arnica, other grasses, forbs, and shrubs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Beartooth soils are not extensive in west-central and southwestern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lewis and Clark County Area, Montana, 1991; proposed in Lewis and Clark County, Montana, 1987.  Beartooth is a landmark name. 

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record MT1128.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from 2 to 9 inches (A horizon), an argillic horizon from 9 to 18 inches (Bt horizon), and a calcic horizon from 18 to 60 inches (Bk horizon). Beartooth soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
