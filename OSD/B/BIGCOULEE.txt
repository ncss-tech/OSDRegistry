BIGCOULEE SERIES  

The Bigcoulee series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in colluvium from mixed igneous rock sources.  These soils occur on linear and concave mountain slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 700 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Pachic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Bigcoulee gravelly loam, in Aspen grove on a 33 percent north facing slope at an elevation of 1494 meters (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

 Bt3--104 to 150 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; common (30 percent) distinct clay films on faces of peds; few (1 percent) fine faint 10YR 5/6 redox concentrations in lower part of horizon; 40 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.8); (combined thickness of Bt horizons - 100 to 130 cm)
