BEMIDJI SERIES

The Bemidji series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of sandy sediments and the underlying coarse loamy till. These soils are on slightly concave to convex slopes on outwash plains and ground moraines.  Slope ranges from 1 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 660 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 66 to 112 centimeters (2B/E and 2Bt horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (A, E1, E2, 2B/E, 2Bt, and 2BC horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 66 centimeters (A, E1 and E2 horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 66 to 112 centimeters (2B/E and 2Bt horizon);
udic moisture regime.

Arenic subgroup based on sandy textures to a depth of 66 centimeters.

Aquic subgroup based on 2 chroma colors in the 2B/E horizon that are considered as redoximorphic depletions.

This series needs further study to clarify classification at the Great Group level.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
