BAGAUL SERIES

The Bagaul series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metamorphic rocks. These soils are on mountains and have slopes of 2 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 1524 millimeters (60 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 12 degrees C (54 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, semiactive, mesic Xeric Palehumults

TYPICAL PEDON: Bagaul loam - under a stand of Douglas-fir, tanoak, Pacific madrone and salal. When described on April 26, 2001 the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated).

(Combined thickness of Bt horizons is 100 to 175 centimeters) 

TYPE LOCATION: Humboldt County, California; Hoopa Tribal Nation; USGS Hoopa topographic quadrangle; WGS84 decimal degrees 41.0896389 latitude, and -123.6708333 longitude; UTM Zone 10 443669 meters E, 4548911 meters N; NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section is dry from July 1st to October 15th and moist in all parts from November 15 to June 1st. This soil has a xeric soil moisture regime. 

Soil temperature: The mean annual soil temperature is 9 to 15 degrees C (49 to 59 degrees F). The difference between the mean summer and mean winter temperature is 6 degrees C or greater. This soil has a mesic soil temperature regime. 

Base saturation: by the ammonium acetate method is less than 35 percent at 131 centimeters.

Surface Fragments: 0 to 10 percent gravels

Soil reaction: very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout the soil profile.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils occur on mountains with slopes of 2 to 50 percent at elevations of 47 to 1391 meters (154 to 4564 feet) in linear slope positions. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from phyllite and schist. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. The mean annual precipitation is 1250 to 2032 millimeters (49 to 80 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F). Mean summer temperature is 20 degrees C (68 degrees F) and the mean winter temperature is 7 degrees C (44 degrees F); mean annual temperature ranges from 9 to 15 degrees C (49 to 59 degrees F). The frost free season is about 150 to 250 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Burroin and Hullygully soils. Burroin soils have schist bedrock between 50 and 100 centimeters and are on convex ridge summits and linear side slopes. Hullygully soils are very deep on steep toe slope positions and do not have an argillic horizon. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well-drained; medium to very high runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for timber production, watershed and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is Douglas-fir, tan oak, Pacific madrone with an understory of salal, Oregon grape, poison oak, and bracken fern. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Siskiyou-Trinity Area, MLRA 5. The series is of moderate extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Humboldt and Del Norte Area, California, 2003. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features include: 

1. Ochric horizon - The zone from 0 to 6 centimeters (Oi and A horizons) 

2. Argillic horizon - The zone from 6 to 165 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, and Bt5 horizons)

3. Particle size control section - the zone from 6 to 56 centimeters, averaging (by weight) 30 percent clay, 24 percent fine sand or coarser, by weight, and 5 percent rock fragments by volume.
