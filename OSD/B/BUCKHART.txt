COMPETING SERIES: These are the Assumption, Aviston, Barrington, Blackberry, Catlin, Clare, Dana, Danabrook, Geryune, Graymont, Harrison, Keltner, Saybrook, and Totanang series. Assumption, Clare, Dana, Danabrook, Geryune, and Graymont soils have subhorizons with more than 7 percent sand within a depth of 40 inches. Aviston soils formed in 60 to 80 inches of loess and have a mean annual soil temperature greater than 56 degrees F. Barrington and Saybrook soils have more than 7 percent sand and carbonates within a depth of 40 inches. In addition, the base of the argillic horizon is at depths less than 40 inches in the Saybrook soils. Blackberry, Catlin and Harrison soils have more than 7 percent sand within depths of 60 inches. Keltner soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches. Totanang soils have more than 7 percent sand below depths of 24 inches and more than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Buckhart soils formed in loess and are on summits on ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to degrees C (50 to 54 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 864 to 106 millimters (34 to 40 inches), frost-free period ranges from 160 to 190 days, and elevation ranges from 122 to 244 meters (400 to 800 feet) above sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Elkhart, Ipava, Muscatune, Newvienna, Osco, Sable, and Virden soils. The well drained Elkhart soils have carbonates within depths of 102 centimeters (40 inches), are on similar parts of the landscape, and are also on sideslopes along drainageways. The somewhat poorly drained Ipava and Muscatune soils and the poorly drained Sable and Virden soils are on nearly level broad interstream divides on positions at lower elevations, and they form a hydrosequence with the Buckhart soils. In addition, the Ipava and Virden soils have a fine-textured particle size control section. The moderately well drained Newvienna soils are on similar positions on the landscape and have a thinner dark surface layer. The well drained Osco soils are on sideslopes along drainageways. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The potential for surface runoff is low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (423. to 14.11 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderate. The depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 61 to 107 centimeters (2 to 3.5 feet) at some time between February and April in most years. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of the Buckhart soils are cultivated. Corn, soybeans, and wheat are the principal crops. Native vegetation is prairie grasses. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: In Central and western Illinois. The soils are of moderate extent in MLRA 108B.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Christian County, Illinois, 1999. The Buckhart series was named for the township where the type location is located in Christian County. 

REMARKS: Buckhart soils were formerly included with the Tama series (Typic Argiudolls). The representative data mapunit for this pedon is DMU ID 44521 for MO-11. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 38 cm (15 inches), (Ap and A horizons). Argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 38 to 132 cm (15 to 52 inches), (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons). Udic moisture regime.
