COMPETING SERIES: These are no series in this family.  When a series is established, this series placeholder will be dropped (see REMARKS).
 
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loess, alluvium, and colluvium
Landform: floodplains, terraces, and hillslopes 
Slope: 1 to 20 percent
Mean annual temperature: 28 to 30 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 15 to 18 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Haplocryods on hillslopes and Histosols in depressional areas.
