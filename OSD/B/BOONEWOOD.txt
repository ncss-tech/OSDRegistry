BOONEWOOD SERIES


The Boonewood series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from limestone, siltstones, shales, and other silty material.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on narrow flood plains and in upland drainageways.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, active, mesic Fluvaquentic Eutrudepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Boonewood silt loam - hayland.  (Colors are for moist soil.)

	Ap -- 0 to 6 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam; moderate fine and medium granular structure; very friable; common fine roots; moderately acid (6.0); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 10 inches thick)

	Bw1 -- 6 to 17 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silt loam; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; slightly acid (6.5); clear wavy boundary.  

	Bw2 -- 17 to 23 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common medium black (10YR 2/1) iron and manganese concretions throughout; common medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) masses of iron accumulation; few fine roots; slightly acid (6.5); abrupt wavy boundary.  (combined thickness of Bw horizon is 8 to 25 inches thick)

	C1 -- 23 to 27 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam; massive; friable; many medium black (10YR 2/1) iron and manganese concretions throughout; common medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) masses of iron accumulation and common medium faint grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) iron depletions; few fine roots; 5 percent gravel; neutral (7.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  

	C2 -- 27 to 30 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam; massive; friable; many medium black (10YR 2/1) iron and manganese concretions throughout; many medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) masses of iron accumulation and common medium faint grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) iron depletions; 5 percent gravel; neutral (7.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (combined thickness of C horizon is 2 to 8 inches thick)

	R -- 30 inches; hard limestone.

TYPE LOCATION: Shelby County, Kentucky; about 3,000 feet east of Fisherville to the intersection of State Highway 148 and State Highway 1531; about 1.5 miles north to the intersection of State Highway 1531 and a gravel road that is adjacent to Shakes Run; about  4,000 feet east in a hay field.  USGS Fisherville Quadrangle (latitude: 38 degrees, 12 minutes, 23 seconds North; longitude: 85 degrees, 26 minutes, 14 seconds West).

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to bedrock range from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments, commonly gravel and channers, range from 0 to 8 percent in the A and B horizons, and 0 to 15 percent in the substratum.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline.  Depth to redoximorphic features, with a chroma of 2 or less, range from 17 to 24 inches.

The A and Ap horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is loam or silt loam.

Some pedons have a transitional horizon between the A and Bw horizons with colors and textures similar to the A horizon.

The Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Redoximorphic features in shades of red, brown, or gray are within 24 inches of the mineral soil surface.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam, and rarely loam.

The C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Redoximorphic features are in shades of red, brown or gray.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam, and rarely loam.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Hontas, Lindside and Senecaville series.  These soils have bedrock at more than 60 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Boonewood soils are nearly level to gently sloping soils on narrow flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  The soils formed in local alluvium washed from surrounding side slopes. Mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 48.2 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ashton, Elk, Kinnick, Lindside, Melvin, Newark, Nolin, Otwood, Sees, and Woolper series.  The well drained Kinnick and Nolin soils, the moderately well drained Lindside soils, the somewhat poorly drained Newark soils, and the poorly drained Melvin soils are on adjacent flood plains.  The well drained Elk and Ashton soils, and the moderately well drained Otwood soils are on adjacent stream terraces. The well drained Woolper soils and the moderately well drained Sees soils are on adjacent foot slopes.  In addition, the Woolper and Sees soils have darker surfaces and more clay in the control section.  The Newark and Melvin soils have dominant low chroma within 20 inches of the mineral soil surface.  The Elk and Ashton soils have argillic horizons, and the Ashton soils have a dark surface.  The Otwood soils have argillic horizons and a fragipan.  All the associated soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained.  Permeability is moderate.  Runoff is negligible where nearly level and low on gentle slopes.  The soil is subject to frequent flooding of brief duration during winter and spring months.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mostly for hay and pasture, with a few areas used for growing corn and tobacco.  The native vegetation was mixed hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: In areas of limestone, shale, siltstone, and loess in central Kentucky.  The series is of small extent.
