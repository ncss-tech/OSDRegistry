BELLTOWER SERIES

The Belltower series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from semiconsolidated sedimentary beds.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, hills and sedimentary plains.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 4l degrees F.
