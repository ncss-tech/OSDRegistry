MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Pamilco County, North Carolina; 1935.

REMARKS: This revision restricts the series to soils with less than 10 percent weatherable minerals in the sand and silt fractions.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Umbric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 14 inches. The A and AB horizons.
Argillic horizon - the zone between the depth of 14 and 64 inches. The BAg, Btg1, Btg2 and Btg 3 horizons.
Aquic moisture regime - horizons with a chroma of 1 or 2. The AB and B horizons.

ADDITIONAL DATA: None
