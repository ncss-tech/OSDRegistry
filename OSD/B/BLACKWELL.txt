BLACKWELL SERIES

The Blackwell series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from basic igneous and acid igneous rocks.  Blackwell soils are on bottomlands, stream terraces and alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow. The average annual precipitation is about 25 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Typic Cryaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Blackwell clay loam, pasture.  (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A1--0 to 1.5 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) silt loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine, fibrous roots; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 2 inches thick)

    A2--1.5 to 2.5 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium and thin platy and moderate medium granular structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fibrous, fine roots, most roots extend horizontally; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 2 inches thick)

    A3--2.5 to 11 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fibrous, fine roots; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual smooth boundary.  (5 to 15 inches thick)

    A4--11 to 19 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) sandy clay loam that approaches sandy loam or loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; slightly acid (pH 6.3); gradual smooth boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)

    Cg--19 to 27 inches; gray (10YR 6/1) sandy clay loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; few fine distinct masses of iron accumulation; slightly acid (pH 6.3); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 40 inches thick)

    2C--27 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) stratified loamy coarse sand and sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grain and massive; hard, very friable; few roots; slightly acid (pH 6.4)

TYPE LOCATION:  Valley County, Idaho; about 8 miles south of Donnelly; 1,160 feet north and 1,700 east of the southwest corner of section 24, T. 15 N., R. 3 E.

A horizon
Hue - 10YR or 2.5Y
Value - 3 or 4 dry, 1 through 3 moist
Chroma - 1 or 2 dry or moist

Cg horizon
Hue - 10YR through 5Y
Value - 5 through 8 dry, 3 through 6 moist
Chroma - 1 or 2 dry or moist

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Foolhen, Furniss, Haydenfork, and Vensora series.  Foolhen and Haydenfork soils do not have lithologic discontinuity. Furniss soils are slightly or moderately alkaline.  Vensora soils have skeletal textures within 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Blackwell soils are on bottomlands, stream terraces and alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent. Elevations range from 3,800 to 9,000 feet and range from 9,100 to 10,600 feet in Colorado.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from basic igneous and acid igneous rocks.  Average annual precipitation is 15 to 30 inches.  Average annual temperature is 39 to 42 degrees F. The frost free season is 50 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Gestrin, Girardot, and Melton soils.  Gestrin soils have an argillic horizon.  Girardot soils lack a mollic epipedon and are calcareous.  Melton soils have a fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal control section.  Gestrin and Melton soils are on alluvial fans.  Girardot soils are on floodplains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; slow runoff; moderately slow permeability.  This soil commonly floods for brief periods from April through June.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Blackwell soils are used mainly for pasture and wild hay.  Vegetation is principally sedges, redtop, bluegrass, and willows.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mountainous areas of Colorado, Idaho, and Nevada.  The series is of moderate extent.
