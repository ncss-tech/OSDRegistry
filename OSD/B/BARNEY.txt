BARNEY SERIES

The Barney series consists of very deep poorly drained and very poorly drained soils formed in stratified loamy material deposited over sandy and gravelly alluvium on flood plains along major streams. Permeability is rapid or very rapid below the loamy material. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Mollic Fluvaquents 

TYPICAL PEDON: Barney loam - on a 0.5 percent slope in rangeland. When described, the soil was moist throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.) 

  A--0 to 7 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; common fine distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist iron accumulations in the matrix; weak thin platy structure; slightly hard, friable; few thin strata of fine sandy loam and loamy fine sand; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (6 to 9 inches thick) 

  ACg--7 to 10 inches; gray (10YR 6/1) loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist, common fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist, iron accumulations in the matrix; weak thin platy structure; slightly hard, friable; few thin strata of fine sandy loam and loamy fine sand; common fine and very fine roots; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline, clear smooth boundary. (0 to 5 inches thick) 

  Cg1--10 to 30 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) fine sand, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; few fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist, iron accumulations in the matrix; single grain; loose; few very fine roots in upper part; few thin strata of silt loam; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.

A horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y

Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: silty clay loam, silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam (includes sandy loam, loamy fine sand, fine sand, sand, clay loam, and mucky loam)
Clay content: 5 to 35 percent

Note: The A horizon is commonly stratified

ACg horizon:

COMPETING SERIES: This is the McCuligan series in the same family. McCuligan soils typically contain more gravel in the particle size control section and contain more sodium.
 
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform: channels on flood plain on river valley 
Slopes: 0 to 2 percent
Elevation: 800 to 4000 feet
Mean annual soil temperature: 49 to 55 degrees 
Mean annual temperature: 47 to 53 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 14 to 30 inches
Frost-free period: 130 to 160 days.
 
GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alda, Boel, Gering, Gothenburg, Inglewood, Inavale, Lex, McGrew, Platte and Wann.
Alda and McGrew soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy skeletal.
Alda, Boel and Lex soils have mollic epipedons more than 10 inches thick.
Gering and Lex soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy skeletal. These soils are all higher on the landscape.
Gothenburg soils have mollic colors less than 6 inches thick and are on similar landscapes.
Inglewood soils have a seasonal high water table at depths of 3 to 5 feet and are higher on the landscape.
Inavale soils are sandy and on excessively drained higher ridges in the landscapes.
Platte soils are somewhat poorly drained and are higher on the flood plain.
Wann soils are coarse-loamy and are higher on the landscape.
 
DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained and very poorly drained.
Runoff is very low or ponded.
Permeability is rapid or very rapid in the Cg2 horizon.
The water table in the poorly drained soil ranges from the surface to a depth of 1.5 feet.
The water table in the very poorly drained soil ranges from +0.5 foot to a depth of 1.0 foot.
These soils are saturated to the surface in the spring in most years when stream flow in adjacent rivers and creeks is highest.
In the spring, areas of Barney soils may be flooded for brief duration. During extended wet periods areas of very poorly drained Barney soils may be ponded for long duration by water from the seasonal high water table.
 
USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used for range or hayland. They are too wet for cultivated crops. The native vegetation consists of big bluestem, switchgrass, indiangrass, reedgrass, prairie cordgrass and numerous sedges. In places, the vegetation includes willows, eastern cottonwood, dogwood, buffaloberry, Indigo bush, and other shrubs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: In Nebraska along the Platte, Niobrara and Republican Rivers and their tributaries. The series is of moderate extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Otoe County, Nebraska, 1946.
 
REMARKS: Many areas of soils in the Barney series have been called "Wet alluvial land" or "Riverwash, stabilized" in former surveys.
OSD Modification RRZ 2/2002: Changed the ROC of gravels from 20 to 40 to 10 to 40 inches.
Diagnostic features recognized in this pedon: mollic colors--the zone from 0 to 7 inches (A horizon); aquic soil conditions--the zone from 7 to 60 inches (Cg1 and Cg2 horizons). The high chromas or brownish colors in the Cg horizons of these soils are due to the colors of the mineral sand grains rather than indicators of reduction and oxidation. 
1/2004 WAW: Added mucky loam and clay loam to texture range of A, and strata of mucky loam, clay loam, and mucky peat to the Cg horizons as suggested by Roger Hammer from work on the "Interduanl soils mapped on flood plains" project.
