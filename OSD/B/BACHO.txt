BACHO SERIES

The Bacho series consists of very shallow and shallow over an indurated duripan, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium on side slopes of partial ballenas and piedmont slopes.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, thermic, shallow Typic Argidurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bacho very gravelly sandy loam, rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is partially covered with 40 percent pebbles, 20 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones.

    A--0 to 3 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and medium platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common fine and medium vesicular pores; 50 percent pebbles, 5 percent cobbles, strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick)

    Btk--3 to 11 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many fine and medium, common coarse and very coarse roots; common very fine and fine tubular, many very fine and fine vesicular pores; common faint clay films on subrounded rock fragments;  50 percent pebbles, 3 percent cobbles, 2 percent stones; common lime pendants on undersides of rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

    Bqkm1--11 to 35 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) strongly cemented duripan; pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; very hard, very firm, brittle; discontinuous indurated laminar cap (2 to 4 mm thick) on some plate like masses; common very fine and fine roots in 1 to 2 mm wide random fractures; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; violently effervescent; gradual smooth boundary.  (20 to 30 inches thick)

    Bqkm2--35 to 39 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) indurated duripan, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; extremely hard, extremely firm, brittle; common silica laminae in fractures, violently effervescent.

TYPE LOCATION:  Nye County, Nevada; approximately 3.5 miles north of Oasis Mountain, about 260 feet north and 790 feet east of the projected southwest corner of section 5, T. 10 S., R. 47 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Usually dry, moist in some part of the moisture control section during the winter and early spring months and for 10 to 20 days following summer convection storms from July through October.

Soil temperature - 63 to 67 degrees F.

Depth to duripan - 8 to 14 inches.


Control section - Clay content: 35 to 50 percent.

Rock fragments - 35 to 60 percent.


A horizon - Value:  4 through 6 moist or dry.


Btk horizon - Value:  4 or 5 moist or dry.

Chroma:  3 or 4.

Texture:  Very gravelly clay or very gravelly sandy clay.

Clay content:  40 to 50 percent.

Rock fragments:  35 to 60 percent, mainly pebbles.

Structure:  Subangular blocky or massive.

Other features:   Faint patchy clay coats on peds in some pedons.


Bqkm horizon - Value:  5 through 7 moist or dry.

Chroma:  3 or 4.

Structure:  Massive or platy.

Consistence:  Very hard or extremely hard dry, very firm or extremely firm moist.

Other features:  Some pedons have plate-like indurated layers in a continuous strongly cemented matrix.

Rupture resistance: Strongly cemented to indurated.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  Similar soils are the Jonnic and Lealandic series.  Jonnic soils have an abruptic boundary at the top of the Bt horizon and are 25 to 40 inches deep to the duripan.  Lealandic soils have duripans at a depth of 20 to 40 inches and have soil temperatures ranging from 62 to 67 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bacho soils are on partial ballenas and alluvial fan remnants.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium mostly 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 2,500 to 4,500 feet.  The climate is hot, and arid with summers punctuated by infrequent convection storms and winters with common rain showers usually in the months of December or January.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches; mean annual temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 180 to 200 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Peloncillo and Longjim series.  Peloncillo soils are on crests of partial ballenas and have loamy-skeletal control sections.  Longjim soils are on steeper areas of partial ballenas and  They lack argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly shadscale, cheeseweed burrobrush, littleleaf horsebrush, Nevada ephedra, and winterfat.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 30.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: PHOENIX, ARIZONA

SERIES PROPOSED:  Nye County (Southwest Part), Nevada, 1982.  The name is coined.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Argillic horizon - The zone from 3 to 11 inches (Btk horizon).

Particle-size control section: The zone from the surface to 11 inches. ( A and Btk horizons)

Duripan - The zone from 11 to 35 inches (Bqkm1 and Bqkm2 horizons).
