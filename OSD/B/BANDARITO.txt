BANDARITO SERIES

The Bandarito series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from shale and siltstone.  Bandarito soils are on fan remnants, terraces, and valley sides.  Slopes range from 3 to 18 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bandarito clay loam, on a south facing, convex, 4 percent slope in grass at an elevation of 7,980 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on July 14, 1993 the soil was moist from 0 to 20 inches.

Remarks:  Laboratory data #S93CO-071-006.  This soil was previously classified as the Fughes series. Laboratory data identified mixed mineralogy instead of smectitic.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by lab sample(s) numbers S93CO-071-006.
