BARREMILLS SERIES 

The Barremills series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on hills.   These soils are on footslopes, swales and drainways and formed in a thin layer of slope alluvium over loess.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Pachic Argiudolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Barremills silt loam - on a concave 3 percent slope in cropland at an elevation of about 770 feet.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

   Ap--0 to 10 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine roots; neutral; clear wavy boundary.  (7 to 10 inches thick) 

   A--10 to 24 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silt loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak fine granular structure; friable; many fine roots; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary.  (10 to 30 inches thick) 

   AB--24 to 27 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; thin coatings of very dark brown (10YR 2/2) in upper part of horizon; common fine roots; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary. (2 to 8 inches thick) 

   Bt1--27 to 32 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) silt loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; many faint dark brown (10YR 3/3) clay films on faces of peds; common fine roots; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. 

   Bt2--32 to 40 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine roots; common faint dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay films on faces of peds; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.

   Bt3--40 to 50 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silt loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; common faint brown (10YR 4/3) clay films on faces of peds; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

   Bt4--50 to 65 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silt loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; common medium prominent grayish brown (10YR 5/2) masses of iron depletion and brown (7.5YR 4/4) masses of iron accumulation; few faint brown (10YR 4/3) clay films on faces of peds; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons ranges from 30 to 50 inches.)

   BC--65 to 80 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) silt loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; common fine prominent grayish brown (10YR 5/2) masses of iron depletion and brown (7.5YR 4/4) masses of iron accumulation; slightly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  LaCrosse County, Wisconsin; about 1 1/2 miles southeast of Barre Mills; 2,635 feet south and 400 feet west of the northeast corner of sec. 33, T. 18 N., R. 5 W. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 48 inches.  The upper 5 to 15 inches of this epipedon is slope alluvium.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay.  The content of fine sand or coarser is less than 15 percent.  Coarse fragments are absent.  Redoximorphic features and saturation occur at depths of 40 to 60 inches.   Saturation occurs for 1 month or more per year in 6 or more out of 10 years.  Saturation may occurs within 40 inches in some pedons but is present less than 1 month per year or less than 6 out of 10 years, or both. 

The Ap or A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3. Reaction ranges from medium acid to neutral.

The AB horizon has chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to neutral. 

The Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.

The BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 to 6.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. 

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cotter, Reading and Troxel series.  These soils are well drained and do not have redoximorphic features at depths of 40 to 60 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Barremills soils are on hills.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  These soils are on footslopes, swales and drainways and formed in a thin layer of slope alluvium over loess.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 51 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 135 to 160 days.  Elevation ranges from 750 to 800 feet in LaCrosse County. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Seaton and Toddville soils.  The well drained Seaton soils are on hill slopes above the Barremills soils and are the source of the slope alluvium.  The Toddville soils are below the Barremills soils and have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Permeability is moderate.  These soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 3.5 to 5 feet for 1 month or more per year at some time during the period October to June in 6 or more out of 10 years. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for cropland.  Common crops are corn, small grain, and hay.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  MLRA M105.  Barremills soils are of small extent.
