SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Wallowa County, Oregon; 1998

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon
*Mollic epipedon--zone from 0 to 33 cm
*Cambic horizon--zone from 33 to 43 cm
*Volcanic glass--zone from 0 to 20 cm
*Depth to lithologic discontinuity--20 cm
*Particle-size control section--zone from 25 to 43 cm

08/2018-OSD reformatted to new Soil Survey Region 1 standards. Volcanic glass and ashy modifier added to the A horizon, which reflects the concept as mapped in the Blue Mountains. Samples should be collected from representative sites to confirm the presence of a Vitrandic subgroup feature. Most shallow and very shallow rangeland soils in Eastern Oregon do not recognize significant ash in the surface layer, so the Bluecanyon series stands out as an outlier.
