BIRCHFIELD SERIES

The Birchfield series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in calcareous gravelly alluvium. These soils are in depressions on alluvial fans, stream terraces, and flood plains. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.
