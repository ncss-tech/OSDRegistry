BLINN SERIES

The Blinn series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on escarpments and basalt plateaus. They formed in colluvium and residuum from basalt with an influence of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 44 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The soils are on basalt plateaus and escarpments. They formed in basalt colluvium and residuum with an influence of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. Elevations range from 2,100 to 3,200 feet. Slope is 5 to 65 percent but the soils occur mainly on less than 35 percent north-facing slopes. The climate is subhumid. The mean annual precipitation is 25 to 30 inches, including 2 to 4 feet of snow. The mean annual air temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is 90 to 110 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bobbitt, Dorb, Lacy and Santa soils. Bobbitt and Lacy soils have a mesic soil temperature regime, occur on south slopes at lower elevations and have mollic epipedons. Dorb soils occur on north slopes at higher elevations and have a thick mantle of volcanic ash. Santa soils do not have bedrock above depth of 40 inches and have a fragipan. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to very rapid runoff; saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Timber production, wildlife, watershed and recreation are the main uses with a few small cleared areas used for pasture. The natural vegetation is mainly an overstory of grand fir, Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, western larch, lodgepole pine and western white pine. The understory is Myrtle pachistima, Columbia brome, sweetscented bedstraw, starry false Solomon's seal, longtube twinflower, mallow ninebark and western meadowrue. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Kootenai and Benewah Counties, Idaho. MLRAs 43A and 9. It is not extensive.
