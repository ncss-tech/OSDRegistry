BEARHAT SERIES

The Bearhat series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in local alluvium derived from mixed rocks with additions of volcanic ash. Bearhat soils are on alluvial fan remnants. Slopes are 4 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy over clayey-skeletal, glassy over smectitic, frigid Vitrandic Argixerolls

COMPETING SERIES: There are currently no other series recognized in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bearhat soils are on alluvial fan remnants. They typically occur on summit positions.  They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with additions of volcanic ash. Slopes are 4 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 2,100 to 2,400 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 460 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bodiehill and Fisherdig series.  

Bodiehill soils have less than 18 percent clay in their particle-size control section. Fisherdig soils have a duripan within 50 cm of the surface.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium surface runoff; slow permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Bearhat soils are used for livestock grazing, recreation, watershed and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, western needlegrass and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern California, east of the Sierra Nevada Range. These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 26.
