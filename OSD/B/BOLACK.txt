BOLACK SERIES 

The Bolack series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in clayey alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Endoaquolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bolack silt loam, native grass (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--3 inches to 0; peat (0 to 4 inches thick) 

    A--0 to 10 inches; black (10YR 2/1) silt loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 15 inches thick) 

    Bg1--10 to 14 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) silty clay loam, light gray (10YR 7/1) dry; many fine distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) redox concentrations; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and medium tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.

    Bg2--14 to 25 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay; light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; many medium distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist redox concentrations; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine and medium roots; common fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual smooth boundary.

    Bg3--25 to 44 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clay; light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; many large distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist redox concentrations; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine and medium roots; few fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bg horizons is 9 to 50 inches.)

    Cg--44 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 6/1) gravelly clay, white (10YR 8/1); many large distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist redox concentrations; massive; very hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; 20 percent pebbles; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lake County, Montana, 1991; proposed in Lake County, Montana, 1986.  Bolack is a coined name. 

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretation Record:  MT1015.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 10 inches (A horizon); horizons with redoximorphic features from 10 to 60 inches (Bg1, Bg2, Bg3 and Cg horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bg1, Bg2 and Bg3 horizons.  Bolack soils have a frigid temperature regime and an aquic moisture regime.
