BOLACK SERIES

The Bolack series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in clayey alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 410 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bolack silt loam, native grass (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 8 cm; peat (0 to 10 cm thick) 

    A--8 to 33 cm; black (10YR 2/1) silt loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (18 to 38 cm thick) 

    Bg1--33 to 43 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) silty clay loam, light gray (10YR 7/1) dry; many fine distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) redox concentrations; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and medium tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.

    Bg2--43 to 71 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay; light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; many medium distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist redox concentrations; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine and medium roots; common fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual smooth boundary.

    Bg3--71 to 119 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clay; light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; many large distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist redox concentrations; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine and medium roots; few fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bg horizons is 23 to 127 cm.)

    Cg--119 to 160 cm; gray (10YR 6/1) gravelly clay, white (10YR 8/1); many large distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist redox concentrations; massive; very hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; 20 percent pebbles; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Bolack soils are used mainly for rangeland, pastureland, hayland, and wildlife habitat.  The potential native vegetation is mainly tufted hairgrass, mannagrasses, northern reedgrass, tall sedges, and tall brushes. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Bolack soils are of small extent in the mountain valleys of western Montana; MLRA 44A.
