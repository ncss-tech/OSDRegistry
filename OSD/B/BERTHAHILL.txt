BERTHAHILL SERIES

The Berthahill series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from quartzite with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  These soils are on mountain slopes, summits, and ridges.  Permeability is moderate. Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 47 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Vaywood series. Vaywood soils do not have an argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Berthahill soils are on mountain slopes with slopes ranging from 15 to 75 percent.  They formed in material weathered from quartzite with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  Elevations range from 4,500 to 5,500 feet.  The average annual temperature is 38 to 41 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is 40 to 55 inches.  The frost-free season is 30 to 100 days (9 years in 10 to 1 year in 10 respectively).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Flumecreek(T), Handoff(T), and Township (T) series.  Flumecreek soils are on mountain side slopes and are frigid.  Handoff soils are on mountain side slopes, are cryic and have umbric epipedons.  Township soils are on mountain side slopes, have high mica substratums and have cambic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, recreation, and wildlife habitat.  Potential natural vegetation is subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, Douglas fir, lodgepole pine, and grand fir with an understory of queencup beadlily, mountain arnica, prince's pine, wild ginger, common pink wintergreen, coolwort foamflower, western goldenthread, rattlesnake plantain, common beargrass, rustyleaf menziesia, myrtle pachystima, and blue huckleberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North Central Idaho.  These soils are not extensive.
