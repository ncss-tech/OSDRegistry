Cudjoe soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments, have greater than 90 percent calcium carbonate equivalence, occur in the tidal zone and are very frequently flooded, and occur in lower landform positions on the Islands of Key West.
Saddlebunch soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments, have greater than 90 percent calcium carbonate equivalence, have frequent flooding from storm surges, and occur in lower landform positions on the Islands of Key West.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Runoff: High or very high
Depth to seasonal high-water table: 0 to 46 centimeters (0 to 18 inches), it has depth of 25 to 91 centimeters (10 to 36 inches) during the drier portion of the year
Ponding frequency and duration: in natural areas, frequent with duration of very long, depth of 0 to 61 centimeters (0 to 24 inches), many areas are drained for cropland and/or urban land.
Hydric Indicators: F10 Marl

USE AND VEGETATION:  
Major uses: vegetables, grain crops, ornamental trees and shrubs, water quality, wildlife habitat, and urban land.  
Dominant vegetation: sawgrass, cattail, primrose willow, sabal palm, buttonbush, bonesets, gulf muhly, broomsedge, and a variety of other water tolerant sedges and grasses.  Calcium carbonate crusted paraphyton covers the soil surface in many freshwater areas.  Exotic tree species, including Brazilian Pepper, Australian Pine, and melaleuca have become established in many disturbed areas.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Florida Everglades and Associated Areas (MLRA 156A). 
Extent: Small extent

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE:  Auburn, Alabama

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Miami-Dade County, Florida; 1990.  

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon:

1.	Limnic soil material - 0 to 38 centimeters (0 to 15 inches) (Lmap, Lma horizons)
2.	Lithic contact - 38 to 64 centimeters  (15 to 25 inches) (2R horizon).
3.	Calcium carbonate equivalent - 70 percent to 90 percent or more

This soil was mapped as Perrine marl, shallow phase and Perrine marl, very shallow phase in the 1947 soil survey of Dade County.  Previously correlated Perrine Variant soils (FL 8002) will be included in this series.
