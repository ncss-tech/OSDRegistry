BEEDE LAKE SERIES 

The Beede Lake series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy Wisconsin glacial age alluvium, clayey lacustrine and in the underlying stratified calcareous silty and clayey lacustrine deposits on dissected glacial lake plains.  Permeability is slow.  Slope ranges from 12 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 762 millimeters (30 inches).  Mean annual air temperature is about 5.5 degrees C (42 degrees F).

SERIES PROPOSED:  Polk County, Wisconsin; 2009. Source of the name is a small lake in Polk County. 

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 56 centimeters (2B/E and 2Bt horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 152 centimeters (A, Bw, 2B/E, 2Bt, 3BC, and 3C horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to 25 centimeters (A and Bw horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 13 to 25 centimeters (Bw horizon);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 25 to 56 centimeters (2B/E and 2Bt horizons);
glossic horizon--the zone from a depth of 25 to 41 centimeters (2B/E horizon);
lithologic discontinuity--at the upper boundary of the 2B/E horizon and at the upper boundary of the 3BC horizon;
soil moisture control section--the zone from a depth of 10 to 30 centimeters; udic moisture regime;
soil temperature control section--at a depth of 50 centimeters; frigid soil temperature regime.

Carbonates are not visually recognizable in the stratified layers and are only evident through application of 1N HCl. The level of effervescence varies with each stratum and the carbonates are assumed to be depositional.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar red clayey soils in the area.
