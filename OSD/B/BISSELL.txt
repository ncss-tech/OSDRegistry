BISSELL SERIES


The Bissell series consists of very deep, well drained soils with moderately slow permeability that formed in alluvium dominantly from granitic rocks. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent in valleys. The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Argixerolls

     Ap--0 to 8 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine pores; few fine gravel; neutral (pH 6.7); abrupt smooth boundary.

(4 to 16 inches thick)

     C1--41 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; many very fine pores; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt smooth boundary.

     C2--60 to 67 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) sandy loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; neutral (pH 6.7).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bjork, Cowiche, Dodes, Fernpoint, Hullsgulch , Indiano, Jerusalem, Madras, Margerum, Noslo, Orr, Pahrange, Quailridge (T), Quiero, Ralls, Shoebend , Simcoe, Springmeyer, Truax, Uhaldi and Wenatchee series. Bjork, Does, Indiano, Madras, Noslo, Pahrange, Quiero, Shoebend, Simcoe and Uhaldi soils have bedrock above a depth of 40 inches. Cowiche soils have a 2Bk horizon with carbonate accumulation and lack mica throughout. Fernpoint soils have 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section and carbonate accumulation at 40 to 50 inches. Hullsgulch soils have continuous lamellae (E&Bt horizons). Jerusalem soils are more than 60 inches to the base of the argillic horizon and have base saturation of 50 to 75 percent in some part. Margerum soils have 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments, dominantly pumice in the control section. Orr soils average less than 25 percent clay in the control section. Quailridge soils have continuous lamellae (E&Bt horizons) and 5 to 25 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Ralls soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the control section and have moderately or strongly alkaline C horizons. Springmeyer soils have 5 to 35 percent rock fragments in the control section, and lack mica throughout. Wenatchee soils have 5 to 15 percent rock fragments in the control section and lack mica throughout.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bissell soils are nearly level to moderately sloping on fan remnants, relict alluvial fans, and stream terraces at elevations of 2,100 to 3,500 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The soils formed in alluvium with significant amounts of mica and feldspar dominantly from granitic rocks mixed with minor amounts of alluvium from volcaniclastic sediments and other igneous rocks. The average annual precipitation is 10 to 15 inches. The average annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free period is 140 to 155 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Harpt, Power and Quenzer soils. Harpt soils lack argillic horizons. Power soils lack mollic epipedons. Quenzer soils are fine textured, somewhat poorly drained and lack argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; very slow to medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Bissell soils are used mainly for irrigated cropland, orchards and hayland/pasture. Some areas have been urbanized. Crops are sugar beets, potatoes, wheat, barley and corn. Native vegetation is basin big sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwestern Idaho. MLRA 11. The Bissell soils are not extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Mayfield Soil Conservation District, Ada and Elmore Counties, Idaho, 1944.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
Mollic epipedon - zone from 0 to 18 inches (Ap and Bt1 horizons)
Argillic horizon - zone from 8 to 14 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)
Particle-size control section - zone from 8 to 28 inches
Soil moisture regime - aridic bordering on xeric

Moderately well drained soils are no longer considered part of this series; however some areas may be subject to an irrigation induced high water table. 

These soils are drier than other Xerolls in the region under similar precipitation due to early runoff and extended period of high evapotranspiration.
