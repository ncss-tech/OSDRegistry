BRUNER SERIES

The Bruner series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from interbedded sedimentary rocks. These soils are on eroded fan remnant sideslopes. Slopes are 35 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 4.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Haploxerepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Bruner extremely gravelly sandy clay loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

 A--0 to 3 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely gravelly sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3), moist; weak fine granular structure; friable, slightly hard, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; many very fine, fine, few medium and coarse roots; many fine irregular pores; 55 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 6 cm thick)

 Bw--3 to 16 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3), moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; many very fine and fine, few medium, and few coarse roots; many fine irregular pores; 30 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline, (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 15 cm thick)

 Bk--16 to 29 cm: dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) very gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4), moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few medium and coarse roots; many fine irregular pores; 40 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; 5 percent carbonate concretions on bottom surfaces of rock fragments; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (13 to 25 cm thick)

 BCk--29 to 64 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4), moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few medium and coarse roots; few fine irregular pores; 35 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; 20 percent carbonate concretions on bottom surfaces of rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear, smooth boundary. (25 to 40 cm thick)

 C--64 to 200 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4), moist; massive; friable, slightly hard, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; 50 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; 20 percent carbonate concretions on bottom surfaces of rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).
