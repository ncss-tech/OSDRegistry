BISCAILUZ SERIES


The Biscailuz series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. Biscailuz soils are on floodplains and lowlands. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 410 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Oxyaquic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Biscailuz, loam. When described the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Bolsa series - have less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser soil particles and are on floodplains or basins typically near the coastline.
Chino series - are formed in alluvium weathered from granitic sources and are on similar landscape positions.
Hueneme series - have a less than 18 percent clay and are on alluvial fans and floodplains.
Metz series - have sandy textures and are on floodplains.
Mocho series - has an irregular decrease in organic carbon and are on alluvial fans.
Pico series - has an irregular decrease of organic matter and are well drained on alluviual fans and floodplains.
San Emigdio series - have less than 18 percent clay and have an ochric epipedon on alluvial fans and floodplains.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained; low and medium runoff; moderate or moderately slow permeability. Many area have been drained by pumping of the water table and concrete lining of channelized stream.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for urban residential and commercial development. Ornamental plants and turf-grass are common in these areas.  On agricultural lands, row and truck crops are grown.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coastal plains and valleys of MLRA 19 - Southern California Coastal Plain. These soils are of moderate extent.
