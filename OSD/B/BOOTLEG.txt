BOOTLEG SERIES

The Bootleg series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of loamy and sandy glaciofluvial or eolian deposits and the underlying silty to clayey glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on glacial lake plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C. and the mean annual precipitation is about 700 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Albaqualfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bootleg fine sandy loam on a concave slope of 2 percent on a glacial lake plain under a forest of intermixed conifers and hardwoods, at an elevation of about 400 meters.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

(Combined thickness of the 2Btg horizon ranges 10 to 72 centimeters)

 2BCtg--97 to 122 centimeters; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) stratified silty clay loam to silty clay to silt loam;  massive; very firm; 10 percent patchy dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) clay films on surfaces along root channels; common medium prominent irregular yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron throughout; common medium irregular very weakly cemented light gray (2.5Y 7/2) carbonate masses throughout and few medium spherical strongly cemented light gray (2.5Y 7/2) carbonate nodules throughout; 1 percent gravel; varves of 2.5Y 5/3 silt loam make-up about 10 percent and varves of 2.5Y 4/2 silty clay make-up about 10 percent of the horizon; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 36 centimeters thick)

 2Cg--122 to 203 centimeters; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) stratified silty clay to silty clay loam;  massive; very firm; common medium prominent irregular yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron throughout; common fine irregular very weakly cemented light gray (2.5Y 7/2) carbonate masses throughout and common medium platy very weakly cemented light gray (2.5Y 7/2) carbonate masses along lamina or strata surfaces; varves of 2.5Y 5/3 make-up about 20 percent of the horizon; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline.
