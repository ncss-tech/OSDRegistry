BANCY SERIES

The Bancy series consists of soils that are well drained and shallow to a duripan that formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and volcanic ash.  They are on terraces.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the average annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, smectitic, frigid, shallow Typic Durixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Bancy gravelly clay loam - on a slope of 3 percent under rangeland vegetation at 1,800 meters elevation.  When described on September 24, 1979, the soil was dry throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

   A--0 to 8 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 25 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 10 cm thick)

   Bt1--8 to 20 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) clay, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds and in pores; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (13 to 20 cm thick)

  Bt2--20 to 43 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure, very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds and in pores; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (15 to 30 cm thick)

   Bkqm--43 to 79 cm; white (10YR 8/1) indurated duripan, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist; massive; extremely hard, extremely firm; many continuous silica cemented laminations throughout the duripan; violently effervescent; abrupt wavy boundary.  (20 to 50 cm thick)

  2R--79 cm; fractured welded tuff.

TYPE LOCATION:  Twin Falls County, Idaho; about 15 miles southeast of Rogerson, Idaho; in the northwest 1/4, southeast 1/4, southeast 1/4, sec. 21, T. 16 S., R. 17 E.; USGS Big Creek Ranch 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 42 degrees 00 minutes 56 seconds N and longitude 114 degrees 27 minutes 40 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 42.0155556 latitude, -114.4611111 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Bkqm horizon
Thickness of first silica lamination: 8 to 15 cm.
Thickness of subsequent laminations: 5 to 10 cm.
Thickness of duripan: 25 to 50 cm.

Btkq when present

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Yancy series.  Yancy soils are more than 150 cm deep to bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bancy soils are on terraces.  The slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and volcanic ash.  Elevations are 1,680 to 1,830 meters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 300 to 400 mm.  The average annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C.  The frost free season is 90 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Aninto, Chayson and Oshone soils.  Aninto soils are clayey-skeletal and occur on terrace sideslopes. Chayson soils are fine-loamy and occur on higher terrace positions on the same landscape.  Oshone soils are moderately deep to the duripan.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Bancy soils are used for rangeland.  Native vegetation is Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, low sagebrush and tall green rabbitbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Bancy soils are of moderate extent in south central Idaho and northeastern Nevada. MLRA 25.
