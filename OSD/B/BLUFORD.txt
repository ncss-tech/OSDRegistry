COMPETING SERIES: 
There are no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Bluford soils are on ground moraines on till plains of Illinoian age. Slope ranges from 0 to 7 percent. Bluford soils formed in 76 to 140 centimeters (30 to 55 inches) of loess and the underlying pedisediment. The loess is late Wisconsin age Peoria Loess and underlying material is early Wisconsin age pedisediment or Roxana Silt which overlie a strongly developed Sangamon age paleosol in Illinoian till. In some pedons, this paleosol occurs within a depth of 200 centimeters. 

Mean annual temperature--12 to 14 degrees C (54 to 57 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation--965 to 1219 millimeters (38 to 48 inches)
Frost-free period--180 to 200 days
Elevation--107 to 213 meters (350 to 700 feet) above mean sea level 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
The moderately well drained Ava soils and the poorly drained Wynoose soils are in a drainage sequence with the Bluford soils. Ava soils are on nearby side slopes below or on convex crests above the Bluford soils. Wynoose soils are on slightly lower positions.
Hickory soils are well drained, fine-loamy, and are on side slopes below. 
Hoyleton soils are somewhat poorly drained, are mollic intergrades, and are on similar positions nearby or on broader interfluves that are farther from dissected parts of the till plain.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class--somewhat poorly drained
Water table--depth to the top of an apparent water table ranges from 15 to 61 centimeters (0.5 to 2 feet) between January and May in normal years
Saturated hydraulic conductivity class--moderately high
Permeability class--moderately slow 

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Most areas of Bluford soils are cultivated. Soybeans, corn, and wheat are the common crops. Native vegetation is deciduous forest consisting mainly of oak and hickory species. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
MLRA 113 in southern Illinois. The series is extensive.

REMARKS: 
Typical Pedon Taxonomic Features-- 
Ochric epipedon--from the surface to a depth 51 centimeters (Ap and E horizons)
Argillic horizon--from a depth of 51 to 152 centimeters (Btg, 2Btgx, and 2Btg horizons) 
Fragic soil properties--brittleness from a depth of 89 to 107 centimeters (2Btgx horizon)
Aquic conditions--redoximorphic features in all horizons below a depth of 18 centimeters
