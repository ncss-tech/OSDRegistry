BLUFORD SERIES

The Bluford series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on broad summits of hillslopes and knolls. They formed in loess and the underlying silty or loamy sediments. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F.), and mean annual precipitation is about 1067 mm (42 inches).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bluford soils are on level and nearly level broad summits and interfluves of hillslopes and knolls. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Bluford soils formed in 76 to 140 cm (30 to 55 inches) of loess and the silty or loamy deposits (pedisediment) thought to be of early Wisconsin age. Some pedons are underlain, within 80 inches, by a Sangamon age paleosol developed in Illinois age diamicton. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 12 to 14 degrees C (54 to 57 degrees F), the mean annual precipitation ranges from 965 to 1219 mm (38 to 48 inches), and the frost-free days range from 180 to 200 days, and elevation ranges from 107 to 213 meters (350 to 700 feet) above mean sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ava, Hickory, Hoyleton, and Wynoose soils. The moderately well drained Ava soils, and the poorly drained Wynoose soils are in a drainage sequence with Bluford soils. Ava soils are on nearby side slopes and convex crests. Wynoose soils are on broad level parts of the till plain. The well-drained Hickory soils are fine-loamy and are on side slopes below Bluford soils. The somewhat poorly drained Hoyleton soils are mollic intergrades and are on similar nearby ridges. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. The potential for surface runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderately slow. The depth to the top of an apparent water table ranges from 15 to 61 cm (0.5 to 2 feet) in January through May in normal years. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Bluford soils are cultivated. Soybeans, corn, and wheat are the common crops. Native vegetation is deciduous forest consisting mainly of oak and hickory species. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Bluford soils are on the Illinoisan till plain in southern Illinois in MLRA 113. The series is extensive. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Washington County, Illinois, 1927. 

REMARKS: Formerly classified as Aeric Chromic Vertic Epiaqualfs. The series is reclassified with this update in order to recognize fragic properties and endosaturation in these soils. Although the high clay subsoil and horizons with fragic properties slow the resaturation of these soils, they are completely resaturated by spring in normal years. Endosaturation better describes the moisture status in these soils for most months. The typical pedon site is relocated to an area on nearly level slopes that better represents the aquic moisture regime. Analysis of supporting NSSL COLE data suggests that the series is not vertic, however the LE/Clay ratio does support smectitic mineralogy. The range in characteristics for the series was adjusted to match the taxonomic classification. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth 51 cm (20 inches) (Ap and E horizons);
argillic horizon - the zone from 51 to 152 cm (20 to 60 inches) (the Btg, 2Btgx, and 2Btg horizons); 
fragic properties - brittleness in the zone from 89 to 107 cm (35 to 42 inches) (2Btgx horizon)
aquic conditions - endosaturation, redox accumulations (Fe-Mn accumulations), and redox depletions (low chroma on faces of peds and in matrices);
Aquic moisture regime.
Mesic temperature regime.
