BURNINGMAN SERIES

The Burningman series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and colluvium over residuum derived from basalt and andesite. Burningman soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes are 4 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy over clayey, glassy over smectitic, frigid Lithic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Burningman extremely cobbly ashy sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). The soil surface is partially covered by 20 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones.

  A--0 to 3 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) crushed extremely cobbly ashy sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) crushed moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 10 percent pebbles and 60 percent cobbles; slightly acid, (pH 6.3); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 5 inches thick)

  Bt1--3 to 8 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) crushed cobbly ashy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) crushed moist; weak fine and medium angular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky, slightly plastic; common fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 25 percent distinct clay bridges between sand grains; 5 percent pebbles and 10 percent cobbles; slightly acid, (pH 6.5); abrupt wavy boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick)

  2Bt2--8 to 18 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) crushed cobbly clay, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) crushed moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, very sticky, very plastic; common fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 30 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds and 30 percent distinct clay films on surfaces along pores; 5 percent pebbles and 20 percent cobbles; slightly acid, (pH 6.4); abrupt irregular boundary. (8 to 12 inches thick)

  2R--18 inches; unweathered hard basalt.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Burningman soils are on hills and mountains. They formed in volcanic ash and colluvium over residuum derived from basalt and andesite. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 4500   to 7500   feet. The climate is subhumid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 26 inches, most of which comes as snow. The mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 60 to 80 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Crazybird and Warnermount series. Crazybird soils have less than 27 percent clay in the control section and have paralithic material within 20 inches. Warnermount soils have less than 35 percent clay in the control section and have bedrock at 40 to 60 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium or high surface runoff; slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Burningman soils are used for watershed, wildlife habitat, and livestock grazing. The vegetation consists of low sagebrush, bluegrass, Idaho fescue, western juniper and antelope bitterbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern California and southern Oregon. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 21. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California.
