BOBBITT SERIES

The Bobbitt series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from basalt bedrock, with an influence of loess and volcanic ash. They are on escarpments, canyons, and basalt plains. Permeability is moderately slow. Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, isotic, mesic Vitrandic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Bobbitt stony ashy loam, forest; on a south-facing 5 percent slope, at 2,400 feet elevation. When described on June 22, 1965, the soil was moist throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. Textures are apparent field textures.)

(7 to 15 inches thick)

	Bt2--22 to 35 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very stony clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; 15 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles and 20 percent stones; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear irregular boundary. (8 to 15 inches thick)

	R--35 inches; hard basalt bedrock; fractured in upper part (2 to 3 feet), with soil material in the cracks.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Gavel, Sallyann and Setill series. Gavel soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact, have 5YR hues throughout,Sallyann soils have Bw horizons and have a hue of 5YR in the Bt horizons. Setill soils are moderately deep to densic materials.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bobbitt soils are on escarpments, canyons, and basalt plains. The soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from basalt with an influence of loess and volcanic ash. Elevations range from 1,900 to 3,200 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 65 percent, but most are more than 35 percent and occur on southerly exposures. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 33 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free season is 100 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Agatha, Blinn, Dorb and Lacy soils. Agatha soils are on north, east, and west aspects, do not have a mollic epipedon, and are deep. Blinn soils are on north, east, and west aspects, and have a frigid temperature regime. Dorb soils are on north aspects and have a thick volcanic ash mantle. Lacy soils are on south-facing ridges and are shallow to a lithic contact.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; rapid to very rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing, recreation, watershed and wildlife habitat. Potential natural vegetation is mainly Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine with an understory of bluebunch wheatgrass, elk sedge, pine reedgrass, western fescue, strawberry, heartleaf arnica, spreading sweetroot, common snowberry, white spirea, and rose.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Idaho, northeastern Washington, and Lassen N.F. California. MLRA 44A, 21, 9. This soil is moderately extensive.
