BLYBURG SERIES 

The Blyburg series consists of very deep, well drained soils on flood plains formed in weakly stratified loamy alluvium. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Fluventic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Blyburg silt loam - cultivated (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

	Ap--0 to 7 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak medium and fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.

	A1--7 to 11 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak medium and fine granular; slightly hard, very friable; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.

	A2--11 to 15 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak medium and fine granular; slightly hard, very friable; few fine pores; disseminated lime through out; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizons is 10 to 20 inches)

	C1--15 to 21 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) stratified silt loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable; many fine pores; disseminated lime throughout; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

	C2--21 to 60 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) stratified silt loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) dry; massive; soft, very friable; many fine pores; 6 percent calcium carbonate disseminated lime throughout; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the:
Eudora soils in the same family which lack free carbonates within depths of 20 inches. 
Other similar soils are:
Armiesburg soils contain more clay in the control section.
Carr soils lack mollic epipedons, are more stratified, and contain more sand. 
Caryville soils contain 15 percent or more fine sand and coarser in the control section. 
Cleora soils are thermic. 
Huntington soils contain more clay in the control section. 
Kennebec soils are leached and have thicker mollic epipedons and contain more clay.
Radford soils contain more clay in the control section. 
Haynie  soils lack mollic epipedons and are more stratified. 
Landes soils contain 15 percent or more fine sand and coarser in the control section. 
Radley soils are thermic. 
Ware soils contain 15 percent or more fine sand and coarser in the control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: weakly stratified, loamy alluvium
Landform:  Flood plains on river valleys
Slopes:  0 to 6 percent
Elevation:  700 to 1300 feet
Mean annual temperature: 47 to 52 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 22 to 28 inches
Frost-free period: 140 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the:
Blencoe series which are finer textured and are on slightly lower positions.
Forney series which are finer textured and are on slightly lower positions.
Lakeport series which are finer textured and are on slightly lower positions.
Luton series which are finer textured and are on slightly lower positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage: Well drained
Permeability: Moderate
Flooding: for brief periods during the months of April through August. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. Corn, soybeans and alfalfa hay are the
principal crops.  Native vegetation was grass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Nebraska, southeastern South Dakota, western Iowa. LRR M, MLRA 102B and 107; the Blyburg series is inextensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Dakota county, Nebraska, 1972.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (A1, A2, C1, C2 horizons)
Mollic epipedon: The zone from 0 to 15 inches.  (Ap, A1, A2 horizons)
Other features: Irregular decrease in organic carbon content at depths between 10 and 50
inches
The percent of calcium carbonate shown in the block description was determined by simple volume calcimeter. 

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from
similar soils in the surrounding area.
