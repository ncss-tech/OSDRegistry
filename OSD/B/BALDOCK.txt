BALDOCK SERIES

The Baldock series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils on floodplains and low terraces.  They formed in mixed alluvium.  Permeability is moderate.  Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent.  The average annual temperature is about 51 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 10 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Calciaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Baldock loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ak--0 to 8 inches; gray (2.5Y 5/1), light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) when crushed loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure, parting to weak very fine granular, moderate very thin platy in upper 2 inches; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, common medium and coarse roots; many fine tubular pores; few lime veins in channels; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 10 inches thick)

    ABk--8 to 16 inches; gray (2.5Y 6/1), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) when crushed loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak coarse and medium subangular blocky structure, parting to weak very fine granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium and coarse roots; many fine and few medium tubular pores; few lime veins; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 12 inches thick)

    Bk--16 to 27 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; few fine faint brown (10YR 5/3) mottles, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and few fine and medium tubular pores; common fine lime veins; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); gradual smooth boundary.  (3 to 20 inches thick)

    C1--27 to 33 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; few fine distinct brown (10YR 4/3) mottles, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine and few fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual smooth boundary.  (4 to 15 inches thick)

    C2--33 to 56 inches; like C1 horizon, except for common mottles.  (5 to 30 inches thick)

    2C3--56 to 65 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; common fine distinct brown (10YR 4/3) mottles, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable; few fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).  (0 to 30 inches thick)

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Filion series.  Filion soils lack a Bk horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Baldock soils are on alluvial fans, floodplains, lake basins, and low terraces at elevations of 2,000 to 4,500 feet.  The soils formed in mixed alluvium.  Slope is dominantly less than 1 percent but ranges to 4 percent.  Average annual temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F and average annual precipitation is 6 to 12 inches including 0.5 to 3.0 feet of snow.  Summers are dry.  The average frost-free period is 110 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Balm, Bowman, Bramwell, Letha, Powder, Stanfield, and Wingville soils.  Balm, Bowman, Powder, and Wingville soils have mollic epipedons.  Bramwell soils are fine silty and have a calcic horizon.  Letha soils are coarse loamy.  Stanfield soils have a duripan.  These soils all occupy similar landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained.  Very slow or slow runoff.  Moderate permeability.  The water table fluctuates between 2 and 3 feet.   Some areas have been drained and are somewhat poorly drained.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly irrigated pasture, hay, small grains, sugar beets, and corn.  The potential natural vegetation is greasewood and saltgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Valleys of eastern Oregon and southern Idaho.  The series is moderately extensive.
