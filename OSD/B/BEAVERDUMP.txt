BEAVERDUMP SERIES 

The Beaverdump series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that mixed alluvium and glacial outwash. These soils are on stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Vitrandic Hapludalfs

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Beaverdump soils are used mainly for woodland, understory grazing, and wildlife habitat. Potential native vegetation is mainly ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, western larch, and grand fir. Understory vegetation is mainly pinegrass, oceanspray, common snowberry, bracken fern, starry false Solomons seal, elk sedge, and other forbs, shrubs, and grasses. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Beaverdump soils are of small extent in the valleys of northwestern Montana.
