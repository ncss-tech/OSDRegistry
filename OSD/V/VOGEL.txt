VOGEL SERIES

The Vogel series consists of shallow, well-drained soils on convex backslopes, shoulders and ridges of mountains. Vogel soils formed in residuum from argillite and other metasedimentary rocks mixed with a small amount of volcanic ash. Slopes are 5 to 90 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 33 inches and mean annual temperature about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Lithic Haploxerepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Vogel very gravelly ashy sandy loam  forested, on a 58 percent planar southeast slope at 5,330 feet elevation. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.  Soil textures are apparent field textures.)

 A--1 to 6 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) very gravelly ashy sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; weak fine granular structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine, few medium roots; few fine irregular pores; 30 percent gravel and, 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick)

 Bw1--6 to 10 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly ashy sandy loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/4) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common fine, medium and coarse roots; few fine and medium irregular pores; 40 percent gravel, and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 12 inches thick)

 Bw2--10 to 20 inches; yellowish brown (10YR5/4), extremely gravelly ashy sandy loam; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common fine, and few medium and coarse roots; common fine and few medium irregular pores; 50 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt irregular boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick)

 R--20 inches; fractured argillite
