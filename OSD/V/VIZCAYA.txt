COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landscape: Lower Coastal Plain
Landform(s): freshwater marshes, swamps, and low broad flats on marine terraces
Parent material: Freshwater clayey fluviomarine deposits over oolithic limestone bedrock
Mean annual temperature: 23 to 27 degrees C (73 to 81degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 940 to 1570millimeters (37 to 62 inches)
Frost-free period: 365 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Biscayne, Chekika and Cooper Town soils. 
Biscayne soils: have calcareous silty marl deposits throughout and occur on similar landform positions on the lower coastal plain.
Chekika soils: formed in very shallow loamy marl deposits and have greater than 35 percent rock fragments and occur on broad flats of the Miami Ridge.
Cooper Town soils: have sapric organic materials throughout over limestone bedrock and occur on similar landform positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage class: Very poorly drained 
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (KSAT): Low to moderately low and negligible in the bedrock
Runoff: negligible to very low
Depth to seasonal high-water table: 0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches) 
Ponding frequency and duration: Frequent for very long durations
Hydric Indicators: A6 Organic Bodies, A7 5cm Mucky Mineral, and A12 Thick Dark Surface
