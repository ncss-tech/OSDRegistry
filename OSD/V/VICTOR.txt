VICTOR SERIES

The Victor series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in outwash derived from igneous rock. These soils are on outwash fans. Slopes are 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 375 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 6.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Victor gravelly sandy loam, in rangeland on a 6 percent slope at 1,090 meters elevation (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise indicated).

    A--0 to 33 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; very friable, slightly hard, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and common medium roots; many fine irregular and interstitial pores; 15 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear smooth boundary. (18 to 38 cm thick)

    Bw--33 to 43 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and medium roots; many fine interstitial pores; 25 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 12 cm thick)

    BC--43 to 76 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; very friable, soft, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; 30 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.6); gradual smooth boundary. (25 to 50 cm thick)

	C--76 to 152 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly loamy coarse sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; very few fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; 45 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.6).

Mean annual air temperature - 4. to 7.0 degrees C
Frost-free period - 80 to 105 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; moderately rapid permeability to a depth of 76 cm and rapid below. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Victor soils are mainly used for irrigated pasture and hayland, or for dryland pasture.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Ravalli County (Bitterroot Valley Area), Montana, 1914. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  
Mollic epipedon - from 0 to 33 cm (A horizon) 
Particle-size control section - from 25 to 100 cm (part of the A, Bw, BC, and part of the C horizons)

Victor soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.

The type location was moved and re-described in 2006 because the original series description did not have location information listed.
