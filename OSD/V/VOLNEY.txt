VOLNEY SERIES

The Volney series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy alluvium with limestone and sandstone fragments.  These soils are on alluvial fans and narrow flood plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 14 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 863 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Cumulic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Volney channery silt loam, on a west-facing slope of 3 percent, on an alluvial fan, in a pasture. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 A1--0 to 18 centimeters; black (10YR 2/1) channery silt loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak fine granular structure; friable; about 30 percent limestone channers (about 5 percent - 2 to 5 millimeters, about 5 percent - 5 to 75 millimeters, and about 20 percent - greater than 75 millimeters in diameter); strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.

 A2--18 to 76 centimeters; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) very channery silt loam, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; weak fine granular structure; friable; about 45 percent limestone channers (about 5 percent - 2 to 5 millimeters, about 10 percent - 5 to 75 millimeters, and about 30 percent - greater than 75 millimeters in diameter); strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizon is 60 to 90 centimeters.)

 C--76 to 203 centimeters; mixed very dark brown (10YR 2/2), very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), and brown (10YR 4/3) extremely channery silt loam; massive; friable; about 85 percent limestone channers (about 5 percent - 2 to 5 millimeters, about 25 percent - 5 to 75 millimeters, and about 55 percent - greater than 75 millimeters in diameter); strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) 105-Northern Mississippi Valley Loess Hills, Winneshiek County, Iowa subset; about 5 1/2 miles east of Decorah; located about 1,650 feet south and 2,315 feet west of the northeast corner of section 21, T. 98 N., R. 7 W.; USGS Freeport topographic quadrangle; lat. 43 degrees 17 minutes 42 seconds N. and long. 91 degrees 40 minutes 24 seconds W.; NAD 83.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Festina, Ion, Lawson, and Worthen soils.
Festina--are at slightly higher landscape positions on treads and risers of stream terraces, have a rock fragment content of less than 15 percent, have argillic horizons and do not have carbonates within a depth of 178 centimeters
Ion--are at lower landscape positions on floodplains, have a rock fragment content of less than 15 percent, have carbonates within a depth of 50 centimeters, and have a buried soil within a depth of 100 centimeters
Lawson--are at lower landscape positions on floodplains, have a rock fragment content of less than 15 percent, do not have carbonates within a depth of 100 centimeters, and have a mollic epipedon 60 to 90 centimeters thick
Worthen--are in landscape positions similar to those of the Volney soils, have a rock fragment content of less than 15 percent, and have a cambic horizon

Drainage class--well drained-a frequently saturated zone does not occur within a depth of 1.8 meters during the wettest periods of normal years
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--high or very high
Surface runoff potential--negligible to low
Flooding--not flooded to occasionally flooded for very brief or brief duration

USE AND VEGETATION:
