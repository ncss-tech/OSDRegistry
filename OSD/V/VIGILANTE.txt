VIGILANTE SERIES 

The Vigilante series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or slope alluvium deposited over hard fractured shale, siltstone or argillite bedrock. These soils are on alluvial fans, hills and ridges. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Vigilante channery loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 7 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) channery loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; 25 percent channers; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary.  (7 to 11 inches thick) 

    Bw1--7 to 16 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very channery loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; common very fine and fine pores; 5 percent flagstones and 50 percent channers; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary. 

    Bw2--16 to 34 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely channery loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; common medium pores; 5 percent flagstones and 65 percent channers; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual irregular boundary.  (Combined thickness of Bw horizons is 20 to 30 inches). 

    BC--34 to 46 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) extremely channery loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common fine pores; 10 percent flagstones and 70 percent channers; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 15 inches thick) 

    R--46 inches; hard pale brown (10YR 6/3) highly fractured shale.
