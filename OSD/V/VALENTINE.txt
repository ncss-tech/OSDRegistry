VALENTINE SERIES

The Valentine series consists of very deep excessively drained soils formed in eolian sands. Valentine soils are on interdunes, dunes and valley sides of sandhills. A few areas are on stream terraces of valleys. These soils have slopes ranging from 0 to 80 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C. (48 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 51 centimeters (20 inches). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, mesic Typic Ustipsamments 

TYPICAL PEDON: Valentine fine sand, on a northeast-facing convex, 21 percent slope in rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.) When described on September 1, 1987 the soil was moist throughout.

  A1--0 to 4 centimeters (0 to 1 inch); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; single grain; loose; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary.

  A2--4 to 13 centimeters (1 to 5 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) fine sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium granular structure; very friable, soft; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary [combined thickness of A horizons is 5 to 23 centimeters (2 to 9 inches) thick]

  AC--13 to 26 centimeters (5 to 10 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse granular structure; very friable, soft; slightly acid; clear irregular boundary [0 to 51 centimeters (0 to 20 inches) thick] 

  C1--26 to 46 centimeters (10 to 18 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; single grain; loose; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary 

  C2--46 to 84 centimeters (18 to 33 inches); very pale brown (10YR 7/3) fine sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; loose; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. 

  C3--84 to 127 centimeters (33 to 50 inches); very pale brown (10YR 7/3) fine sand, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; single grain; loose; neutral; few 2 millimeter horizontal, discontinuous yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) and brown (7.5YR 5/4) lamellae; gradual boundary.  

  C4--127 to 203 centimeters (50 to 80 inches); very pale brown (10YR 7/3) fine sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist, single grain, loose; few 5 millimeter horizontal, discontinuous brown (10YR 5/3) lamellae; neutral.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Duda, McKelvie, Peji, Simeon, Tivin and Tonalea series in the same family. 
Duda, Peji and Tonalea soils: have sandstone at depths between 20 and 40 inches
McKelvie soils: have sandstone fragments in the control section 
Simeon soils: have a control section of loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, sand or coarse sand and it contains more than 35 percent medium and coarse sand and less than 50 percent fine or very fine sand, and up to 15 percent by volume of gravel.
Tivin soils: lack any lamellae within the profile. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform/Landscape: interdunes, dunes and valley sides on sandhills;  a few areas are on stream terraces of valleys
Relief: zero to over 122 meters (400 feet)
Parent material: eolian sands
Mean temperature: 7.8 to 10 degrees C. (46 to 50 degrees F.)
Mean annual precipitation: 36 to 64 centimeters (14 to 25 inches) 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dunday, Els, Elsmere, Ipage, Loup, Marlake, Nenzel, and Tryon soils. 
Dunday soils: are lower on interdunes and dunes and has a mollic epipedon
Els, Elsmere soils: are lower on interdunes and have aquic conditions starting at 46 centimeters (1.5 feet). Elsmere has a mollic epipedon.
Loup and Tryon soils: are on swales on interdunes and have aquic conditions starting at 0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 1/2 foot). Loup has a mollic epipedon.
Ipage and Nenzel soils: are lower on interdunes and have aquic conditions starting at 91 centimeters (3 feet). Nenzel has a mollic epipedon.
Marlake soils: are in depressions on interdunes and have aquic conditions starting at 0 centimeters (0 feet)

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage: excessively drained 
Runoff: negligible to low depending on slope
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: high 

USE AND VEGETATION: The major use is livestock grazing. The native plant community is prairie sandreed, little bluestem, sand bluestem, switchgrass, sand lovegrass, needle and thread, blue grama and hairy grama. The rangeland ecological sites are Sandy, Sands, and Choppy Sands with each having three different precipitation zones: 14-17 P.Z., 17-22 P.Z. and 22-25 P.Z. Minor use is cropping. Irrigated corn, alfalfa, and forage are the principal crops. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Principally north-central Nebraska, but also extending into South Dakota. LRR G, MLRA 65. The series is of large extent. Estimated acreage is over 5,000,000 acres.

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 13 centimeters (0 to 5 inches) (A horizon) 
A clayey substratum phase has been recognized at 102 to 203 centimeters (40 to 80 inches).
Soil moisture control section: moist in some part from October through April; intermittently moist from May through June; driest in July through September
Moisture regime: ustic 
3/2006 LRM: included metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.
10/2006 RRH: Introductory Paragraph: revised landform/landscape and slope range. Typical Pedon and Type Location: moved from Logan County, Nebraska to Cherry County, Nebraska to better represent the sandhills and site has SSL data. Range In Characteristics: C horizon  added lamellae properties for some pedons. Geographic Setting: revised. Geographically Associated Soils: deleted Duda, Simeon, Doger Gannett, Hersh, Ord and Ovina soils as these soils do not occur at the new type location. Added Ipage, Nenzel, and Marlake soils as these soils occur at the new type location.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Samples No. S54-Neb-16-1 and 2; MSL No. 2440-2444 and 2445-2449, as published in Soil Survey Investigations No. 5.
Data is available of typical pedon (Site ID 87NE031100) at Soil Survey Laboratory of the National Soil Survey Center.
