VINSON SERIES

The Vinson series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy residuum over gypsum bedrock of Permian age.  The soils are on nearly level to gently sloping summits and shoulder slopes of hills and ridges in the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78B, 78C).  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 60.5 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, thermic Entic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Vinson silt loam on a 3 percent slope, in range.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A--0 to 10 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) silt loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3), moist; 23 percent clay; moderate fine granular structure; friable, slightly hard; many fine roots; common fine and few medium pores; common worm casts; 2 percent fine carbonate nodules; 2 percent 2 to 20 millimeter fragments of dolomite; slight effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (6 to 18 inches thick)

     Bk--10 to 28 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) silty clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4), moist; 30 percent clay; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky; friable, hard; common fine roots; common fine and common very fine pores; common worm casts; 2 percent fine and medium carbonate nodules and 2 percent fine and medium carbonate masses; 2 percent 2 to 20 millimeter fragments of dolomite; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the B horizons is 10 to 25 inches thick)

     Bky--28 to 32 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) silty clay loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6), moist; 30 percent clay; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; friable, hard; few fine roots; common fine and common very fine pores; common worm casts; 2 percent fine and medium carbonate nodules and 2 percent fine and medium carbonate masses; 5 percent fine and medium gypsum masses; 2 percent 2 to 20 millimeter fragments of dolomite; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary.

     Cr--32 to 37 inches; weakly cemented gypsum bedrock; fractures in the gypsum are 5 to 6 inches apart; high excavation difficulty; common coats of carbonate in rock fractures; clear wavy boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick)

     R--37 to 72 inches; strongly cemented gypsum bedrock, fractured at intervals of 39 to less than 78 inches; massive; extremely high excavation difficulty.

Cr Horizon (where present)

Hue: 7.5YR to 10YR
Value: 6 to 8
Chroma: 1 to 6

R Horizon

Hue: 7.5YR to 10YR
Value: 6 to 8
Chroma: 1 to 6
Texture: strongly to very strongly cemented crystalline gypsum or alabaster  bedrock 5 to 15 feet thick that is strongly to very strongly cemented. The gypsum is interbedded with reddish-brown claystone and thin layers of dolomite and greenish-gray claystone. The upper boundary of the R horizon is a lithic contact and is root restrictive. This material has very high to extremely high excavation difficulty.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in this family.  Similar soils are Acme, Cornick and Cottonwood. 
Acme series: These soils are very deep and do not have residuum within 80 inches.
Cornick series: These soils are less than 20 inches to bedrock.
Cottonwood series: These soils are less than 20 inches to bedrock and do not have a mollic epipedon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: residuum over gypsum bedrock, mostly of the Blaine Formation of Permian age.
Landform: summits and shoulder slopes of hills and ridges in the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78B, 78C).
Slope: ranges from 0 to 5 percent
Mean annual air temperature range: 57 to 64 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation range: 22 to 32 inches
Frost-free period: 180 to 230 days
Elevation: 1,200 to 2,400 feet
Thornthwaite annual P-E indices: 32 to 48

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cornick, Cottonwood, Knoco, and Talpa series.  
Cornick and Cottonwood soils: occur on similar areas, but are usually on steeper slopes.
Knoco soils: occur on similar to steeper areas and are less than 20 inches deep to claystone.
Talpa soils: occur on slightly higher summit areas and are less than 20 inches deep to dolomitic limestone.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Vinson soils are well drained; permeability is moderate.  Runoff is negligble on 0 to 1 percent slopes, and low on 1 to 5 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly as native range for beef cattle. Native vegetation is tall and midgrasses, mainly sand bluestem, little bluestem, sideoats grama, and indiangrass.  Some areas have mesquite and redberry juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78B, 78C) of Oklahoma and Texas.  The series is of minor extent.
