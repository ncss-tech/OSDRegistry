VASSAR SERIES

The Vassar series consists of deep, well-drained soils that formed in volcanic ash overlying material weathered from granitic bedrock.  Vassar soils are on mountains and have slopes of 5 to 75 percent.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to 26 inches and high below this depth. The average annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vassar soils are on mountains and have slopes of 5 to 65 percent.  Elevations range from 1,600 to 5,200 feet.  They occur on northerly aspects at lower elevations.  The soils formed in loess and volcanic ash overlying material weathered from granite, gneiss, or schist. The average annual precipitation is 30 to 45 inches and the average annual air temperature is 38 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 50 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ardenvoir, Threebear, Moscow, and Vay soils.  Ardenvoir and Vay soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the lower part.  Threebear soils have a fragipan.  Moscow soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well-drained; rapid to very rapid runoff; Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to 26 inches and high below this depth.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for timber production, watershed, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  A few areas are used for limited livestock grazing. The principal vegetation is western redcedar, western white pine, grand fir, western larch, Douglas-fir, with an understory of myrtle pachystima, northern twinflower, goldthread, and queenscup beadlily.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Idaho and eastern Washington.  The soils are extensive.  MLRA 43A.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Latah County, Idaho, 1939.

REMARKS:  Revision of 10/2002 changed the classification from Ashy over loamy, mixed Typic Vitricryands to Ashy over loamy, amorphic over isotic Typic Vitricryands.

Revision of 10/2012 changes the classification from Ashy over loamy, amorphic over isotic Typic Vitricryands to Ashy over loamy, amorphic over isotic, frigid Typic Udivitrands after an investigation of Vassar across its extent.  Depth class also changed from deep and very deep to deep.  Areas of Vassar that are very deep (primarily in Kootenai County) should be investigated further to determine proper series assignment and parent material (parent material in ID606 is metamorphic).  

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 8 inches (Oi, Oe and A horizons)
Cambic horizon - the zone from 8 to 26 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)
Particle-size control section - 2 to 42 inches (A, Bw1, Bw2, 2C1, and part of the 2C2 horizons)
Andic soil properties - the zone from 2 to 26 inches (A, Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)
Paralithic contact - the zone below 55 inches (2Cr horizon)

Additional Data: Laboraory data are available for this series: NSSL pedon ID S08ID057003, Pedon No. 09N0077, from Latah County, Idaho, and NSSL pedon ID S04ID057008, Pedon No. 05N0161 from Latah County, Idaho.
