VITROFF SERIES

The Vitroff series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium or slope alluvium from tuffaceous volcanic bedrock. These soils are on alluvial fans, saddles and sideslopes of mountains. Slopes are 4 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Vitrandic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Vitroff ashy loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 1 inch; forest litter of slightly decomposed needles, twigs and roots. (1 to 3 inches thick)

    E1--1 to 3 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) ashy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common coarse, medium, fine and very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 2 percent angular pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary.

    E2--3 to 8 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) ashy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common coarse, medium, fine and very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 10 percent angular pebbles; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of E horizons is 6 to 20 inches)

    Bt and E--8 to 15 inches; Bt part (65 percent) is brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly ashy clay loam lamellae 1/2 to 5/8 inches thick, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; E part (35 percent) is very pale brown (10YR 7/3) ashy sandy clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; Bt part is hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; E part is slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic, few coarse and common medium, fine and very fine roots; few fine and common very fine tubular pores; 20 percent pebbles and 5 percent angular cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary. (6 to 18 inches thick)

    Bt--15 to 33 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly ashy clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few medium and fine and common very fine roots; few, fine and common very fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent pebbles and 10 percent angular cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); diffuse wavy boundary. (8 to 18 inches thick)

    BC--33 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) extremely gravelly ashy coarse sandy loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; massive; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and very fine roots in the upper 2 feet; 50 percent pebbles and 20 percent angular cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4).

COMPETING SERIES:

Culdecole (ID) - has a udic moisture regime; does not have horizons containing lamellae.

Hopburn (ID) - has a udic moisture regime; does not have horizons containing lamellae.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - alluvial fans, saddles and sideslopes of mountains.
Elevation - 5,500 to 7,700 feet.
Slope - 4 to 60 percent.
Parent material -  colluvium from tuffaceous volcanic bedrock.
Climate - long, cold winters; cool, moist springs; short, cool summers.
Mean annual precipitation - 15 to 24 inches.
Mean annual temperature - 36 to 40 degrees F.
Frost free period - 30 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Torpy series. Torpy soils do not have an argillic horizon and are loamy-skeletal. They are on similar landform postitions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Vitroff soils are used mainly for timber production and understory grazing. Native vegetation is mainly lodgepole pine and Douglas-fir with an understory of grouse whortleberry, pinegrass, kinnikinnick, Oregongrape, woods pussytoes and common juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Vitroff soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Jefferson County, Montana, 1998.

REMARKS: Soil Interpretation Record: MT1732. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: an ochric epipedon from the mineral soil surface to 8 inches (E1, E2 horizons); an argillic horizon from 8 to 33 inches (Bt and E, Bt horizons); a particle size control section from 8 to 28 inches (Bt and E and Bt horizons). Vitroff soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
