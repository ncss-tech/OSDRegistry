VANAJO SERIES

The Vanajo series consists of very deep, moderately well and somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone and shale. Vanajo soils occur on alluvium fans, and basin floors. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 8.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, carbonatic, mesic Aquic Torrifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Vanajo silty clay--irrigated cropland. (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap--0 to 25 cm; light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) silty clay, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium granular structure; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and medium roots; few fine and common medium tubular pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual smooth boundary. (5 to 33 cm thick)

    C1--25 to 64 cm; pink (5YR 7/3) silty clay, reddish brown (5YR 5/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and few medium roots; few fine and medium tubular pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); gradual wavy boundary. (25 to 50 cm thick)

    C2--64 to 152 cm; light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) silty clay, reddish brown (5YR 5/3) moist; massive; very hard, very firm, very sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; few fine and medium tubular pores; thin strata, 1 to 2 cm thick of 7.5YR 5/2 silty clay; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5).

TYPE LOCATION: Sevier County, Utah; 1 mile southeast of the Richfield Airport; 2,015 feet south and 1,377 feet west of NE corner section 11, T.24S., R. 3W.; USGS Annabella 7.5 minute quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 43 minutes 46 seconds N and longitude 112 degrees 5 minutes 39 seconds W; NAD 83

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: Usually dry; moist in winter and early spring; aridic bordering on xeric soil moisture regime. These soils are saturated with water within 100 cm of the surface at some time in most years.
Mean annual soil temperature: 9.0 to 12.0 degrees C.
Organic matter: Either decreases irregularly with depth or remains above 0.35 percent to a depth of 125 cm.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 40 to 60 percent between depths of 25 and 100 cm. 

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 40 to 50 percent.

A horizon
Hue: 2.5YR through 7.5YR.
Value: 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma: 3 or 4 dry, 2 through 4 moist.
Reaction: Moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline.

C horizon
Hue: 2.5YR through 7.5YR.
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 through 4 dry, 3 through 6 moist.
Texture: Silty clay or clay and has thin strata of silty clay loam in some pedons. 
Clay content: 40 to 50 percent. 
Texture: Silt loam or silty clay loam.
Reaction: Moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform: alluvial fans and basin floors
Parent material: alluvium from limestone and shale
Elevations: 1,550 to 1,670 meters. 
Slopes: 0 to 1 percent 
Mean annual precipitation: 200 to 300 mm. 
Mean annual temperature: 8 to 10.5 degrees C. 
Frost-free period: 100 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Naser, Poganeab, Quaker and Redview soils. Naser, Quaker and Redview soils have less than 35 percent clay in the control section, and are well drained. Poganeab soils are poorly drained and have 28 to 35 percent clay.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well and somewhat poorly drained; low runoff; slow permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used principally used for irrigated crops of alfalfa, small grains, pasture, corn and sugar beets, and native pasture. Native vegetation is wiregrass, sedges, saltgrass and alkali sacaton. These soils are correlated to semi-wet alkali flat and semi-wet fresh meadow ecological sites in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sevier County, Utah. MLRA 28A. This soil is inextensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES PROPOSED: Sevier SCD, Sevier County, Utah, 1960, now part of the Sevier Co. Survey Area, Utah.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 18 cm (part of the Ap horizon).
Aquic feature - Soil is saturated within 100 cm of the soil surface each year.
Particle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (C1 and part of C2 horizons).
