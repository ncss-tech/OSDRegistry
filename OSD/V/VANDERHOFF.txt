VANDERHOFF SERIES



The Vanderhoff series consists of moderately deep over soft bedrock,

well drained soils on dissected terraces.  They formed in material

weathered from siltstone or tuff.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes

are 0 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 9

inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Typic Torriorthents

TypicTorriorthents



TYPICAL PEDON:Vanderhoff very gravelly loam-rangeland; on a 45 percent

south-facing slope. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 5 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) very gravelly loam, grayish

brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; weak thin platy and weak very fine granular

structure; soft, very friable; common fine roots; many fine and very

fine vesicular pores; slightly effervescent with thin lime coating on

lower side of pebbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual smooth

boundary.  (0 to 6 inches thick)



    Bk1--5 to 12 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) gravelly loam, grayish

brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft,

very friable; common fine roots; common very fine pores; slightly

effervescent with thin lime coating on lower side of pebbles;

moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual smooth boundary.  (4 to 8 inches

thick)



    Bk2--12 to 23 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) gravelly loam, grayish

brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; massive (laminations); hard, firm, slightly

sticky; few fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; strongly

effervescent with thin lime coating on lower side of pebbles;

moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary.  (9 to 30 inches

thick)



    Cr--23 inches; white (2.5Y 8/2) siltstone, light yellowish brown

(2.5Y 6/3) moist; massive strong thick plates; very hard, very firm;

few very fine tubular pores; few fine black manganese oxide stains;

slightly effervescent; mildly alkaline (pH 7.4).



TYPE LOCATION:  Owyhee County, Idaho; about 7 miles west of Marsing;

450 feet south and 50 feet west of the NE corner of the NW1/4 SW1/4

section 32, T.3N., R.5W.

Value - 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist

Chroma - 2 or 3

Effervescence - slight through strong



Bk horizon

Hue - 2.5Y or 10YR

Value - 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist

Chroma - 2 through 4

Texture - SIL, L, VFSL, FSL, GR-L

Clay content - 5 to 18 percent

Rock fragments - 0 to 25 percent

Effervescence - slight or strong



Other features - underlying siltstone or mudstone is high in volcanic

ash and may be tuffaceous.



COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Apron, Fruitland, Geer, Jeddito,

Mazuma, Moepitz, Piltdown, Sodaspring, Trachute, and Worland series.

All of these except Jeddito, Moepitz, Trachute, and Worland soils lack

predominately coarse textured control sections.  Moepitz soils have a

lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches, hue of 5YR, and are loamy

very fine sand to very fine sand.  Piltdown and Sodaspring soils are

greater than 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Worland soils lack layers of

carbonate accumulation and have sandstone bedrock at depths of 20 to 40

inches.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vanderhoff soils are on dissected lacustrine

terraces at elevations of 2,000 to 5,500 feet.  The slopes range from 0

to 60 percent.  The soils formed in residuum and colluvium from

consolidated siltstone or tuff of the Payette or related Tertiary

formations.  In places, there may be a minor admixture of loessial

materials in the surface horizon.  Average annual precipitation is 6 to

11 inches, including 5 to 25 inches of snow, and the average annual air

temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 110 to 160

days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Baldock and Minidoka

soils.  Baldock soils have mottles associated with wetness above a

depth of 20 inches.  Minidoka soils have a duripan.  Baldock soils are

on low terraces.  Minidoka soils are on less sloping areas.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow through very rapid

runoff; moderate permeability.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Mostly rangeland.  Vegetation in the potential

natural plant community is shadscale, bud sagebrush, Indian ricegrass,

and Sandberg bluegrass.  A few areas are irrigated and produce pasture,

alfalfa, small grain, sugar beets, and vegetables.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Idaho and southeastern Oregon.

Moderately extensive.
