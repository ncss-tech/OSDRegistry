VALERIAN SERIES

The Valerian series consists of very deep, excessively drained, and rapidly permeable soils that formed in sandy eolian deposits of Holocene age. These soils occur on gently sloping to moderately steep hills or dunes. Slope ranges from 1 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 406 mm (16 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 12.2 degrees C (54 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, mesic Ustic Torripsamments

TYPICAL PEDON: Valerian fine sand, on a west-facing, convex, undulating plain, 12 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of about 1,300 m (4,265 ft.). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

Calladito, Dwyer, Karval, Mido, Orpha, Sandyranch, Tullock, Valent, and Wigton soils: occur in a cooler climate with an average MAAT less than 11.1 degrees C. (52 degrees F.) 
Nara and Visa soils are on similar landscapes and have argillic horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: sandy eolian deposits of Holocene age.
Landform: very gently sloping to moderately steep hills or dunes.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Corlena, Dallam, Monia, Nara, Spurlock, Vingo, and Visa series.
Dallam soils are on nearly level to gently sloping plains have a fine-loamy particle size control section.
Corlena soils are on narrow floodplains of draws have a fine-silty particle-size class.
Nara and Visa soils: are on interdunes and dunes and have argillic horizons and do not have a calcic horizon.
Spurlock soils are on similar landscape positions and have argillic horizons and carbonatic mineralogy.
Vingo soils are on similar landscape positions and have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage class: excessively
Permeability class: rapid
Runoff: negligible on less than 5 percent slopes and very low on 5 to 20 percent slopes

USE AND VEGETATION:
Mainly used for livestock grazing. Climax vegetation is a Tallgrass/Shrub community. The major tallgrass species are sand bluestem, giant sandreed, little bluestem, and taller dropseed species. The midgrasses are sideoats grama, sand lovegrass, sand paspalum, sand dropseed, blue grama, and perennial threeawns. A large variety of forbs exist but the amount varies greatly from year to year. Woody shrubs consist of sand sagebrush, skunkbush sumac, yucca, and the occasional sand plum thickets. This is a fragile site and is subject to severe wind erosion if not protected by cover. This soil has been correlated to the Sand Hills (R077BY020TX) ecological site in MLRA-77B, 12-17" PZ.
