VERSHAL SERIES

The Vershal series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or residuum from igneous rock or hard sedimentary bedrock.  These soils are on bedrock-floored plains, escarpments and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Vershal very channery loam, 20 percent slope in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A1--0 to 4 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very channery loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; 5 percent cobbles; 40 percent channers; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.

    A2--4 to 8 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) extremely channery loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; 15 percent cobbles; 55 percent channers; neutral (pH 7.0). (The combined thickness of the A horizons is 5 to 10 inches)

    R--8 inches; hard sandstone bedrock with a few cracks; few fine roots in some cracks.

Wuby (UT) - has fine sandy loam textures in the A and Bw horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - bedrock-floored plains, escarpments and hills.
Elevation - 4,000 to 6,000 feet.
Slope - 2 to 60 percent.
Parent material - colluvium or residuum derived from igneous rock and hard sedimentary bedrock.
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; short, warm summers.
Mean annual precipitation - 15 to 19 inches, most of which falls during spring and early summer.
Mean annual air temperature - 38 to 43 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 70 to 115 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Vershal soils are used mainly for rangeland.  The potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, needleandthread, western wheatgrass, forbs, and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Vershal soils are of moderate extent in west-central Montana.  MLRAs 43B, 44B, and 46.
