COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bogart, Centerburg, Cygnet, Haney, Houcktown, Jenera, Jugtown, Nicely, Reaville, Scattersville, Swampoodle, Thackery, Tuscola, Vanlue, and Williamstown series. Bogart, Thackery and Haney soils average more than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Centerburg, Cygnet, Houcktown, Jenera, Nicely, Vanlue and Williamstown soils have more than 10 percent clay and glacial till in the lower part of the series control section. Jugtown soils formed in alluvium with rock fragments of sandstone, chert, and shale. Reaville soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Scattersville soils formed in colluvium from mixed basic and acidic rock materials and typically contain mica flakes. Swampoodle soils formed in colluvium over residuum derived from greenstone schist, biotite schist, and basic gneiss and are strongly acid or very strongly acid throughout the soil profile. Tuscola soils do not have rock fragments in the soil profile and formed in stratified loamy and silty lacustrine sediments.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Vallonia soils formed in loamy outwash over sandy stratified outwash on low stream terraces and flood-plain steps. Slope gradients range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 13 degrees C. (52 to 56 degrees F.), mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1143 mm (40 to 45 inches), frost-free period ranges from 170 to 200 days, and elevation ranges from 110 to 305 meters (360 to 1,000 feet) above sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Armiesburg, Nineveh and Whitaker soils. The well drained Armiesburg soils are on adjacent flood plains. The well drained Nineveh soils are on slightly higher rises. The somewhat poorly drained Whitaker soils are on slightly lower treads. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The potential for surface runoff is low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/sec) in the solum and high or very high (42.34 to 141.14 micrometers/sec) in the substratum. Permeability is moderate (0.6 to 2 inches per hour) in the solum and rapid (6 to 20 inches per hour) in the substratum. In drained areas, the depth to the top of the apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 feet from December to April in normal years. These soils are subject to occasional or frequent periods of annual flooding. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Soils are mostly cropped to corn, soybeans, wheat, and hay. Native vegetation is dominantly deciduous hardwood forest. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The type location is in MLRA 114A. The soils are of small extent.
