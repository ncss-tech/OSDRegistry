VESEY SERIES

 The Vesey series consists of deep, well drained, moderately
 permeable soils on uplands and high stream terraces.  These soils
 formed in loamy fluvial and marine sediments.  Slopes are mainly 1
 to 5 percent, but range to 20 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, semiactive, thermic Glossic Paleudalfs

 TYPICAL PEDON:  Vesey fine sandy loam--pastureland, 5 to 8 percent
 slope.
                 (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise
 stated.)

      A1--0 to 8 inches; dark brown (10YR 4/3) fine sandy loam;
 moderate fine granular structure; very friable; common fine roots;
 slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)

      A2--8 to 24 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) fine sandy
 loam; single grained; loose; few fine roots; medium acid; clear
 smooth boundary.  (14 to 24 inches thick)

      B21t--24 to 42 inches; yellowish red (5YR 4/6) sandy clay
 loam; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable;
 few fine roots; few fine pores; thin continuous clay films on
 surface of peds; medium acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (10 to 20
 inches thick)

      B22t--42 to 52 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/8) sandy clay
 loam; few fine distinct red and few fine faint strong brown
 mottles; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; few
 fine pores; thin patchy clay films on surface of peds; few
 uncoated sand grains; few pebbles of quartz 2 to 5 mm in diameter;
 slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (6 to 16 inches thick)

      Bt & A'2--52 to 59 inches; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) loam;
 few fine distinct red and light gray mottles; common light gray
 (10YR 6/1) silt coatings, 1/2 to 2 mm thick, on faces of peds;
 weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; few fine
 pores; few clay films and clay bridging sand grains; about 5
 percent pockets of uncoated sand grains; medium acid; gradual
 smooth boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)

      B3--59 to 68 inches; red (10R 4/8) sandy loam; many coarse
 prominent mottles of light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) and few fine
 distinct reddish yellow mottles; weak medium subangular blocky
 structure; slightly hard, very friable; majority of sand grains
 are bridged and coated with clay; few to common uncoated sand
 grains; few reddish concretions about 5 mm in diameter; strongly
 acid.

 TYPE LOCATION:  Red River County, Texas; about 16.5 miles
 northwest of Clarksville; site is 15 miles north of Detroit on
 Farm Road 410, 0.65 mile west on county road, and 0.85 mile north
 on private road, 50 feet east of road.

 RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from about 50
 inches to more than 80 inches.  Thickness of the A horizon is 20
 to 36 inches.  The A1 or Ap horizon is dark brown or brown (7.5YR
 4/2, 4/4, 5/2, 5/4; 10YR 4/3) or yellowish brown (10YR 5/4).  The
 A2 horizon is brown (7.5YR 4/4, 5/4), strong brown (7.5YR 5/6,
 5/8), reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), or
 brownish yellow (10YR 6/6).  The A horizon is fine sandy loam or
 loamy very fine sand, and is neutral through medium acid.

 The B2t horizon is dark red (2.5YR 3/6), red (2.5YR 4/6, 5/6),
 yellowish red (5YR 4/6, 4/8, 5/6, 5/8), brown (7.5YR 4/4), strong
 brown (7.5YR 5/6), or reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6).  The upper 20
 inches of the Bt horizon is sandy clay loam or clay loam with the
 clay content averaging between 18 and 30 percent.  The B2t horizon
 is strongly acid through slightly acid.  Mottles of brownish
 yellow, strong brown, yellowish brown, and red range from none to
 few.  The Bt & A'2 horizon has less clay than the Bt horizons.  It
 contains 5 to 10 percent pockets of uncoated sand and has few or
 common silt or sand coatings, 1/2 to 2 mm thick, on ped faces.
 This horizon is strongly acid through slightly acid.

 The B3 horizon is red, yellowish red, or pink in hue 10R to 5YR.
 It is sandy loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy fine sand and is
 strongly acid through neutral.

 Competing Series:  These are the Bernaldo, Cahaba, Dougherty,
 Kamie, Konawa, Naldo, Stiversville, Toine, and Whakana series.
 Bernaldo soils have siliceous mineralogy.  Cahaba soils have
 siliceous mineralogy and have base saturation less than 35
 percent.  Dougherty soils have a sandy epipedon 20 to 40 inches
 thick; in addition, they and Konawa soils are dry for longer
 periods of time within the moisture control section.  Kamie,
 Toine, and Whakana soils have A horizons less than 20 inches
 thick.  In addition, Toine soil lack secondary eluviation in the
 lower Bt horizon.  Naldo soils lack colors redder than 7.5YR.
 Stiversville soils have more than 15 percent coarse fragments and
 have phosphatic limestone bedrock within depths of 40 to 65
 inches.

 GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vesey soils are on gently sloping to
 moderatly steep uplands and high stream terraces of the Southern
 Coastal Plain.  Slope gradients range from 1 to about 20 percent.
 The soils formed in unconsolidated sandy and loamy fluvial and
 marine sediments.  At the type location, the average temperature
 is about 65 degrees F.; the mean annual rainfall is about 45
 inches; and the Thornthwaite P-E index is about 76.

 GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Whakana
 series, and the McKamie and Kenney series.  McKamie soils have
 more than 35 percent clay in the control section. Kenney soils
 have a sandy epipedon thicker than 40 inches.  Whakana and McKamie
 soils occupy similar positions in the landscape.  Kenney soils are
 on higher positions.

 Drainage and Permeability:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderate
 permeability.

 USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of this soil is used for woodland and
 pasture.  A few areas are used for growing corn, grain sorghum,
 soybeans, and watermelons.  Native vegetation is mixed pine and
 hardwood forest that include shortleaf and loblolly pine, red oak,
 sweetgum, and post oak.

 DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Coastal Plain, mainly in
 eastern Texas.  The series is inextensive.

 SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Red River County, Texas; l972.

 REMARKS:  Vesey soils were formerly classified in the Red-Yellow
 Podzolic great soil group.  They were previously included with the
 Dougherty series.

 ADDITIONAL DATA:  Limited data indicate that the A horizon is
 loamy very fine sand or fine sandy loam with a clay content of
 about 10 percent and silt content of about 32 percent.
