VERJELES SERIES

The Verjeles series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in material weathered from intrusive basic igneous rocks, mainly gabbrodiorite.

Craigsaddle soils are 100 to 150 cm to a densic contact. Flanly soils lack clay textures in the upper 2Bt horizon. Millvilla soils are 50 to 100cm to a paralithic contact with metasedimentary rock. Motherlode soils are 100 to 150 centimeters to a lithic contact with metavolcanic rock. Sierra soils are 100 to over 150 centimeters to a paralithic contact. Wardsferry soils are 100 to 150 cm to a paralithic contact with metasedimentary rock. Yellowlark soils are 100 to 150 centimeters to a duripan and formed in mixed alluvium.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Verjeles soils are on footslopes of hills. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. The soils formed in materials from intrusive basic igneous rock, mainly gabbrodiorite. Elevations are 245 to 825 meters. The climate is Mediterranean, with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The average annual precipitation is 505 to 1050 mm. The average January air temperature is 8 degrees C; the average July air temperature is 25 degrees C; mean annual air temperature is 14 to 16 degrees C. The frost-free season is 235 to 270 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Flanly, Mildred, Orose, and Sierra soils. Flanly soils are well drained and occur backslopes. All these soils are well drained. Mildred soils have greater than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are on mountain slopes. Orose soils have a paralithic contact between 25 and 50 cm and occur on shoulders of hills. Sierra soils are 100 to over 150 cm to a paralithic contact and occur on backslopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained; low to moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity throughout the particle size control section of the soil; saturated hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock is very low to moderately low.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are mainly used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, watershed, and homesite development. Natural vegetation is blue oak, interior live oak, California foothill pine and scattered ponderosa pine with an understory of shrubs, and annual grasses and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Foothills of California; MLRA 18. The series is not extensive.
