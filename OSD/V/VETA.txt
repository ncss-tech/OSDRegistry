VETA SERIES

The Veta series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks.  Veta soils are on inset fans, alluvial fans, fan remnants, lake plains, and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Veta extremely gravelly sandy loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 15 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely gravelly sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few medium and fine, many very fine roots; many fine and very fine interstitial pores; 45 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 23 cm thick)

    Bw--15 to 46 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few medium, common fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine interstitial pores; 50 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (15 to 40 cm thick)

    C--46 to 97 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely gravelly coarse sandy loam; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few medium, common fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine interstitial pores; 50 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual smooth boundary.  (15 to 60 cm thick)

    Ck--97 to 152 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few medium and fine, common very fine roots; many fine and very fine interstitial pores; 35 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; secondary carbonate coats on bottoms of rock fragments; neutral (pH 7.2).

TYPE LOCATION:  Lyon County, Nevada; about 2 miles southwest of Artesia Lake and about 900 feet north of benchmark 4644; approximately 2,450 feet north and 1,150 feet west of the southeast corner of section 9, T. 12 N., R. 23 E.; USGS Pine Nut Valley 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 55 minutes 04 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 24 minutes 20 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.9177778 latitude, -119.4055556 longitude.

Soil moisture: Usually moist in winter and spring; dry mid-June through October; aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 10 to 13 degrees C.
Depth to base of cambic horizon: 30 to 50 cm.
Depth to secondary carbonates: 70 to 100 cm.
Reaction; Neutral through moderately alkaline.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 5 to 15 percent.
Rock fragments:  35 to 75 percent, mainly gravel.  Lithology of fragments are mixed igneous rocks.

Chroma:  2 through 4, dry or moist.
Texture: Very gravelly or extremely gravelly loam, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam.
Effervescence: Noneffervescent to strongly effervescent in the Ck horizon.
Other features:  Thin strata of loamy sand or loamy coarse sand common in lower subhorizons of some pedons.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cewat, Darkcanyon, Drinkwater, Lonegrave, Finley, Kiona, Minat, Nibbs, Veet, and Wifton series.

Cewat, Darkcanyon, and Lonegrave soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Drinkwater soils have 20 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Finley soils have a sandy 2C horizon at a depth of 50 to 100 cm.  Kiona soils have mainly cobbles in the particle-size control section and a cambic horizon that directly overlies a Bk horizon.  Minat soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section and depth to the base of the cambic horizon is 50 to 76 cm.  Nibbs soils have secondary carbonates within 38 cm and have a lithologic discontinuity within the control section.  Veet soils are moistened intermittently from 10 to 20 days cumulative from June through September and the cambic horizon directly overlies a Bk horizon.  Wifton soils are dominated by stones in the particle-size control section, have identifiable secondary carbonates at depths of 25 to 50 cm, and have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 10 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Veta soils are on inset fans, alluvial fans, fan remnants, lake plains, and stream terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 1,220 to 1,830 meters but range down to 732 meters in Idaho.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Abgese, Fulstone, Haybourne, Reno, Saralegui, and Washoe soils.  Abgese and Washoe soils have an argillic horizon.  Fulstone and Reno soils have an argillic horizon and a duripan.  Haybourne soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Saralegui soils have an argillic horizon and lack rock fragments.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; very low or low surface runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  These soils are susceptible to rare flooding for brief or very brief periods year-round or occasional flooding for very brief periods between February and July.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Veta soils are mainly used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Some areas are used for irrigated cropland and urban development.  The vegetation is principally Indian ricegrass, Wyoming big sagebrush, and spiny hopsage. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada and southwestern Idaho.  These soils are moderately extensive.  The series concept and main acreage is in MLRA 26, while other acreage occurs in MLRAs 24 and 27 in Nevada and MLRA 25 in Idaho.
