VANDA SERIES

The Vanda series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from semiconsolidated sedimentary bedrock or from glaciolacustrine or glaciofluvial deposits.  These soils are on alluvial fans, lake plains, sedimentary plains, drainageways, and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, calcareous, frigid Torrertic Ustorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Vanda clay, cultivated (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 4 inches, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; a massive 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick crust over weak very fine granular structure; very hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; common fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine vesicular pores; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (4 to 6 inches thick)

    Bz--4 to 12 inches, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; extremely hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine pores; few fine masses of salts; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 24 inches thick)

    Byz--12 to 60 inches, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; extremely hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine pores; many fine and medium masses of gypsum and other salts; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Cascade County, Montana; 800 feet north and 50 feet west of the SE corner of sec. 8, T. 21 N., R. 2 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil temperature - 42 to 47 degrees F.

Moisture control section - between 4 and 12 inches; dry in all parts between four-tenths and five-tenths of the cumulative days when the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F.

Depth to Byz horizon - 4 to 24 inches.

A Bw horizon is allowed above a depth of 7 inches that has characteristics similar to the A horizon.

COMPETING SERIES:

Orinoco (MT) - has a Bky horizon; has a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.

Sunburst (MT) - has Bk and Bky horizons; has electrical conductivity of less than 8 mmhos/cm; does not have a vesicular surface crust.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - alluvial fans; stream terraces; lake plains; sedimentary plains; drainageways.

Elevation - 1,900 to 4,500 feet.

Slope - 0 to 15 percent slopes.

Parent material - alluvium derived mainly from semiconsolidated sedimentary bedrock or from glaciolacustrine or glaciofluvial deposits.

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; hot, dry summers.

Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 16 inches, most of which falls in the spring and in the early part of summer.

Mean annual air temperature - 40 to 45 degrees F.

Frost-free period - 90 to 135 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Vanda soils are used mainly for range.  The potential native vegetation is mainly western wheatgrass, Nuttall alkaligrass, big sagebrush, blue grama, alkali sacaton, forbs, and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Vanda soils are extensive and occur in the eastern plains of Montana and in the states of North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Blaine County, Montana, 1969.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation records:  MT0023, MT0157.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - from the soil surface to 7 inches (Ap, Bz horizons); massive material that is extremely hard - from 4 to 60 inches (Bz, Byz horizons); particle size control section - from 10 to 40 inches (Bz, Byz horizons). The Vanda soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.

Series will be reclassified to proposed Torrertic subgroup as soon as it is approved.
