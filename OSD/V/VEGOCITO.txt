VEGOCITO SERIES

The Vegocito series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly or moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium or slope alluvium derived from stream deposits formed on Cretaceous bedrock plateau. Vegocito soils occur along stream terraces within plateau river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 410 mm and mean annual soil temperature is about 11.7 degrees C.

Calcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 3 percent from 0 to 25cm (0 to 10 in.), less than 15 percent in any horizon below 
Other features: Buried A, or C horizons (stratified layers with high amounts of sands and gravels) may occur below 100 cm depth in some pedons. 
A horizon - Hue: 7.5YR to 10YR; Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Balko(MLRA 77E), Conchovar(MLRA 35), Irwin(MLRAs 74, 76, and 112), Knifehill(MLRA 35), Lubbock(MLRA 72), Millpaw(MLRA 35), Nutreeah(MLRA 35), Ruidoso(MLRAs 38 and 39), and Tully(MLRA 76) series. 
Balko soils formed in calcareous loess and are warmer (12.8 to 13.9 oC MAAT) and wetter (432 to 584 mm MAP).
Conchovar and Knifehill soils are drier (330-406 mm MAP) with fewer frost free days (100 to 135) with Conchovar hues ranging from 2.5Y to 5YR.
Irwin, Lubbock, and Tully soils have a typic-ustic soil moisture regime with Irwin bordering on Udic.
Millpaw, Nutreeah and Ruidoso soils are drier (304-406 mm MAP) and do not receive the bulk of their growing season moisture until July.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Vegocito soils occur on lower stream terraces of plateau river valleys and formed from floodplain alluvial deposits with a fining-upward sequence and some minor amount of loess deposits at the surface. Most of these terrace positions are on landforms old enough to have a developed argillic horizon, but young enough to still have a stratified layer within 200 cm depth that includes sandy or gravelly alluvial materials. Unlike floodplains, these soils are not naturally subirrigated. These terraces can often be identified by their accessibility to flood irrigation ditch networks, whereas older stream terraces are not (this is a guide, not a rule). 
Slope range: from 0 to 3 percent but can be as high as 8 percent along terrace risers. 
Mean annual precipitation: from 381 to 457 mm (15 to 18 inches)
Mean annual soil temperature from 9.4 to 14.4 degrees C (49 to 58 degrees F)
Mean annual air temperature: from 8.3 to 12.8 degrees C (47 to 57 degrees F.) 
The frost-free season: from 130 to 175 days 
Elevation: from 1676 to 2286 m (5,500 to 7,500 feet)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Gallinas and Philmont series of MLRA 70A. The Gallinas soils are on stream terraces of riparian systems and have a fine loamy family texture class. Philmont soils are on upland landforms and its mollic epipedon is less than 50cm thick.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderate. Runoff is negligible on slopes less than 1 percent and very low on 1 to 3 percent slopes. Water table can be present in stratified zone below 100 cm in some terraces (younger-lower). Also, varied amounts of saturation can be induced in some horizons, usually above or below the contact with coarser stratified layers, from flood irrigation waters. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Principal use is for dryland and irrigated cropland and pasture. Present vegetation is blue grama, western wheatgrass, vine mesquite, alkali sacaton, arctic rush, buffalograss and minor amounts of fourwing saltbush and cacti. This series is correlated to the Low Terraces ecosite GX070A01X012.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern New Mexico, LRR G, in MLRA 70A along the Canadian Plateaus of the Southwestern Great Plains; LRU 70A.1 (Canadian Plateaus). The series is of limited extent.
