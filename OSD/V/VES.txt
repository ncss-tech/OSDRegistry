VES SERIES

The Ves series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy, calcareous, friable till. These soils are on convex knolls and side slopes on ground moraines and till plains.  Slope ranges from 3 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 685 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters; series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 20 centimeters (Ap horizon);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 20 to 56 centimeters (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons);
calcic horizon--the zone from a depth of 56 to 84 centimeters (Bk horizon);
udic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
