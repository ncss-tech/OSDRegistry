VANOCKER SERIES

The Vanocker series consists of deep to very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium from sedimentary rocks.  Vanocker soils are on gently sloping to very steep ridges and hillslopes in mountains.  They have moderately low and moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Slopes range from 2 to 80 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 585 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Inceptic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Vanocker gravelly silt loam, on a west-facing, linear slope of 38 percent under ponderosa pine forest at an elevation of 1,432 meters.  When described on June 1, 1976 the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Citadel, Hopdraw, Rockerville(T), Sawdust, and Tollflat (T) soils. 
Citadel and Tollflat (T) - are fine-textured; they generally occur below Vanocker soils on the landscape
Hopdraw - are sandy-skeletal and lack argillic horizons; they occur on similar landscape positions as Vanocker soils
Rockerville(T) - are shallow to a lithic contact; they generally occur above Vanocker soils on the landscape
Sawdust - lack argillic horizons; on similar landscape positions as Vanocker

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium to very high runoff, depending on slope; moderately low to moderately high hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for timber production, recreation and wildlife habitat, and for grazing.  Native vegetation is dominantly ponderosa pine with lesser amounts of aspen, birch, and bur oak.  Understory species include Kentucky bluegrass, needlegrass, timber oatgrass, roughleaf ricegrass, and little bluestem.  Shrubs include bearberry, oregon-grape, common juniper, buffaloberry, and snowberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Low Limestone Plateau physiographic area of the Black Hills in western South Dakota and northeastern Wyoming; LRR G, MLRA 62.  The series is extensive. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Denver, Colorado 

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Meade County, South Dakota, Southern Part, 1974. 

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - 2.5 to 7.5 cm (A horizon) 
Argillic horizon - 7.5 to 40 cm (Bt and Btk horizons)

The classification of the series was revised from Typic Eutroboralfs to Inceptic Hapludalfs due to changes in Soil Taxonomy (02/1999).
