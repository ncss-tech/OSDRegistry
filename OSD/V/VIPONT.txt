VIPONT SERIES

The Vipont series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, and residuum derived from sandstone, quartzite, and mica schist.  Vipont soils are on hills, mountains, and cuestas.  Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Vipont very stony loam--on a 46 percent south-facing slope at 1,830 meters elevation--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

(8 to 28 cm thick)

    Bt2--33 to 56 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) extremely cobbly clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and medium roots; few fine tubular pores; many distinct and faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 50 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones, and 10 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (10 to 46 cm thick)

    R--56 cm; hard bedrock; slightly fractured and weathered in the upper 5 to 13 cm.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bullump, Bullvaro, Burchflat, Camelback, Chrisflat, Demner, Dogbed, Dooh, Erig, Krenka, Leroman, Lockgate, Murain, Nutval, Snyderville, Softback, Softscrabble, Staberg, and Vetagrande series.

Bullump and Camelback soils have lithic contacts between 100 and 200 cm from the soil surface.  Bullvaro, Demner, Dooh, Nutval, and Vetagrande soils have an aridic moisture regime.  Burchflat soils have rock fragments of andesite, tuff, or tuff-breccia.  Chrisflat, Dogbed, Krenka, Murain, Snyderville, Softback, and Softscrabble soils are very deep.  Erig soils are deep to lithic contacts.  Leroman and Staberg soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Lockgate soils are deep to paralithic contacts.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vipont soils are on hills, mountains, and cuestas.  They typically occur on backslope or scarp face positions.  These soils formed in alluvium, colluvium, and residuum derived from sandstone, quartzite, and mica schist.  Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  Elevation ranges from 1,525 to 2,135 meters. The mean annual precipitation is 360 to 560 mm, the mean annual temperature is 3.9 to 7.2 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Acord, Chen, Mackey, and Winu soils.  Acord soils are clayey-skeletal, very deep, and are on fan remnants.  Chen soils are clayey-skeletal, shallow to lithic contacts, and are on adjacent slope positions.  Mackey soils do not have argillic horizons and are on adjacent slope positions.  Winu soils have cryic temperature regime and are on adjacent slope positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; very high surface runoff; moderately slow saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Vipont soils are used mainly for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The natural vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Idaho fescue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Idaho.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRAs 11, 13, and 25.
