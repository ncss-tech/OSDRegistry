VITRINA SERIES

The Vitrina series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist.  Vitrina soils are on toeslopes of eroded fan remnants.  Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Julesburg, Latierra, Mainter, Manter, Mawer, Torrington (T), and Truckton series.  Julesburg, Manter, Mainter, Mawer, Torrington, and Truckton soils all average less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and the solum.  In addition, Julesburg, Manter, and Mawer soils have sola that do not have a significant amount of medium to very coarse angular granitic sands; Torrington soils are moderately deep to soft bedrock; and Truckton soils are noncalcareous to depths of more than 60 inches.  Latierra and Mainter soils have an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vitrina soils are on toeslopes of eroded fan remnants.  They formed in alluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist.  Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,400 to 6,600 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Golondrina and Haozous soils.  Golondrina soils are loamy-skeletal and formed in colluvium on adjacent backslopes of eroded fan remnants.  Haozous soils have recent alluvial mantles over thick mollic epipedons and occur on adjacent, frequently flooded inset fans.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; low surface runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Vitrina soils are used for urban development, livestock grazing, and recreation.  The historic climax vegetation is blue grama, black grama, oak, galleta, and oneseed juniper.  The ecological site is Hills(R036XB124NM).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Vitrina soils are of small extent on the southeastern Espanola Basin part of the Basin and Range province in northcentral New Mexico.  The MLRA is 36.
