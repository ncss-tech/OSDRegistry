Aquic conditions occur from about 61 to 102 cm (24 to 40 in) from the surface for short periods during the fall and winter months.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major land use is livestock grazing.  A few areas are used for pastureland.  The native plant community for these prairie soils include grasses such as little bluestem, Indiangrass, brownseed paspalum, longtom, dropseeds, bristlegrasses, windmillgrasses, and annual grasses.  A few widely scattered, small mesquite and huisache trees have encroached in some areas.  (Ecological site name: Claypan Prairie  28-44" PZ; Ecological site number: R150AY528TX)

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Refugio County, Texas; 1984.  The name Vidauri comes from a community in Refugio County.

REMARKS:  The soils were formerly included in the Edna series.  The series type location was changed from Refugio County to Goliad County during the update of Refugio County and the initial soil survey of Goliad County.  The series family was changed 9/2007 from fine to fine-loamy with support from laboratory data (S01TX-175-002) from the type location in Goliad County and study across the series province. Soil moisture monitoring indicated aquic conditions occur below 50 cm from the surface. The gleyed colors in the Btg, Btkg, and Btnkg are considered relic and may have occurred during a wetter period.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle size control section: 10 to 60 cm (4 to 24 in).  (Bt1, Bt2, and Btg1 horizons) 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 10 cm (0 to 4 in).  (A horizon) 
Argillic horizon: 10 to 203 in.  (4 to 80 in) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, Btk, Btnk1, Btnk2 horizons)
Natric horizon: 124 to 203 cm (49 to 80 in).  (Btnk1 and Btnk2 horizons)
Episaturation:  The zone of saturation at 23 to 104 cm (9 to 41 in).  (Bt2, Btg1, and Btg2 horizons)
Aquic conditions: 81 to 104 cm (32 to 41 in) from December to March in normal years

Additional Comments:
The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data number S01TX-175-002 from Goliad County, Texas.
