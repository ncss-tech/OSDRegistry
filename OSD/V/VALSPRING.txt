VALSPRING SERIES

The Valspring series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine materials or alluvium derived from basalt. Valspring soils are on upland playa locations of volcanic fields. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Pachic Vertic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Valspring-Venport complex (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     A1--0 to 2 inches (0 to 5 cm); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky, very plastic; few very fine and fine dendritic tubular pores; many very fine roots throughout; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary

     A2--2 to 4 inches (5 to 11 cm); brown (7.5YR 4/3) clay, very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky, very plastic; many very fine roots throughout; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary

     Bt1--4 to 22 inches (11 to 57 cm); brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay, very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) moist; strong medium angular blocky; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky, very plastic; common very fine roots throughout; 10 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual smooth boundary

     Bt2--22 to 36 inches (57 to 92 cm); brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay, very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2), moist; strong medium angular blocky; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky, very plastic; few very fine roots throughout; 10 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual smooth boundary

     Btss1--36 to 46 inches (92 to 117 cm); brown (7.5YR 4/3) clay, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; strong medium angular blocky; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky, very plastic; 50 percent distinct pressure faces on all faces of peds; 3 percent gravel; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual smooth boundary

     Btss2--46 to 55 inches (117 to 140 cm); brown (7.5YR 4/3) clay, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; strong medium angular blocky; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky, very plastic; 50 percent distinct pressure faces on all faces of peds; 5 percent gravel; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual smooth boundary

A horizon
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 or 5 (3 or 4 moist)
Chroma: 2.5 or 3, dry or moist
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 2 percent
Reaction: neutral or slightly alkaline

B horizon
Hue: 5YR or 7.5YR
Value: 3 or 4 (2.5 or 3 moist)
Chroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist
Texture: clay
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 2 percent
Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR): 0 to 2

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: residuum derived from dolomite
Landform: structural benches and ridges
Slopes: 2 to 40 percent
Elevation: 6,800 to 7,400 feet
Mean annual air temperature: 43 to 49 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 14 to 18 inches
Precipitation peaks in July and August, and in winter months.  May and June are much drier.
Frost-free period: 100 to 120 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Venport, and Pinespring soils.  Venport soils are in aquic soil positions.  Pinespring soils are in stream bed and terrace positions above Valspring soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: somewhat well drained, very slow permeability

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used principally as grazing land. Native vegetation is mainly plains coreopsis, sedge, and spike muhly.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Arizona. MLRA 39.  The series is of limited extent.
