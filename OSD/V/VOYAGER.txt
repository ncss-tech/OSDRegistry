VOYAGER SERIES

The Voyager series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in eolian material and alluvium derived dominantly from granitic rock overlying lacustrine sediments.  Voyager soils are on alluvial flats and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Adelino series in the same family and the Rosamond series.  Adelino soils are moist for up to 90 days during the summer months.  Rosamond soils do not have a cambic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Voyager soils are on alluvial flats.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in eolian material and alluvium derived dominantly from granitic rock overlying lacustrine sediments.  Elevations are 2,270 to 2,375 feet.  The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and cool, slightly moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 4 to 6 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F.  Mean July temperature is about 83 degrees F., and mean January temperature is about 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 200 to 250 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Leuhman (T) soils.  Leuhman soils have natric horizon and are slightly lower in elevation on alluvial flats.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; negligible to low runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Voyager soils are used for military operations and wildlife habitat.  In the past some areas were used for irrigated cropland.  Vegetation is dominantly spinescale saltbush, shadscale, Nevada ephedra and alkali bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of California.  The series is not extensive. MLRA 30.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California

SERIES PROPOSED: Los Angeles County, California, 1988.  The name is from the Voyager airplane that was built and tested locally.

REMARKS:  The Voyager series is in MLRA 30.  The Voyager series is being mapped where it matches to areas mapped as the Rosamond series in the Antelope Valley Soil Survey.  Rosamond soils are classified as Typic Torrifluvents, fine-loamy, mixed (calcareous), thermic.  The Voyager soils have a cambic horizon and they are on alluvial flats that should not receive the amount of flooding that would be expected for Torrifluvents.

Rationale for Horizonation
The A horizon consists of eolian material blown onto the soil after the original surface horizon had eroded away.  The abrupt boundary and contrasting texture indicates a discontinuity.  The 2Btk and 2C horizons are the second sequum which is from granitic alluvium.  The 2Btk horizons have genetic development indicated by clay films and segregated carbonates.  The abrupt boundary at 28 inches deep and the finer textures below indicate a discontinuity.  The 3B horizons are the third sequum which is from lacustrine sediments indicated by the finer textures, higher pH, SAR and EC.  The 3Btb has a "b" suffix in addition to an Arabic prefix because it has genetic development, i.e. clay films.  The horizon from 40 to 50 inches is a B horizon because of removal of carbonates to the horizon below.

Classification was fine-loamy, mixed, thermic Typic Camborthid.  It has been updated according to National Soil Taxonomy Handbook Amendment No. 18.

Runoff classes based on Ksat and slope as described in "Terminology Used in Soil Survey Data Entry or Manuscript Editing of:" 9-23-94 MAV.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the profile are:

1. Ochric epipedon -- 0 to 6 inches (A)

2. Cambic horizon -- 6 to 19 inches (Btk1, Btk2).
This horizon is marginal to being an argillic horizon.  However, it should be a cambic because of the lithologic discontinuity above the horizon, the geomorphic position, and the weakness of development.  The horizon from 28 to 40" deep is not an argillic horizon because it has a lithologic discontinuity at its upper boundary and has no clay films on surfaces of peds.

3. Soil moisture and temperature regimes
These values are based on adjacent soil survey areas without direct observations.  The soil temperature is below 47 degrees F. from about December 15 to February 20, and is usually never below 41 degrees F. The soil between the depths of 4 and 12 inches is dry throughout for 275 to 310 days from about March 1 to December 15.  It is moist throughout for 10 to 50 days from about January 1 to March 1 and is moist in some or all parts for 55 to 90 consecutive days from about December 15 to March 1 when the soil is above 47.

4. Particle size class: Fine-loamy.  The 10- to 40-inch particle-size control section averages 24 percent clay based on field estimates.

5. This soil is not in the Fluventic subgroup despite the stratification below 28 inches.  Colors do not suggest a significant change in organic carbon with depth.
