VERMDIG SERIES

The Vermdig series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from andesite, tuff-breccia, and tuff.  Vermdig soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 500 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4.4 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Animas series.  Animas soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vermdig soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on toeslope positions.  They formed in slope alluvium derived from andesite, tuff, and tuff-breccia.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 2,290 to 2,595 meters.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 410 to 610 mm, the mean annual temperature is 2.8 to 5.6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Aspocket and Monibasin soils.  Aspocket and Monibasin soils have mollic epipedons more than 40 cm thick and have bedrock within 100 to 152 cm of the soil surface.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; very high surface runoff; moderately slow permeability (moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity).  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 75 and 100 cm (moderately deep free water occurrence class) from March to July.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  Episaturation is occasionally present within the upper 15 to 38 cm from March to May.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Vermdig soils are used for rangeland, recreation, watershed, and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is mainly silver sagebrush, bluegrass, and mat muhly.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern California, on the east side of the Sierra Nevada Range.  These soils are not extensive with about 125 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRAs 22A and 26.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 33 cm (A, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons).
Argillic horizon - The zone from 5 to 152 (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, and Bt5 horizons).
Aquic conditions - The conditions of endosaturation and reduction in horizons between 99 and 152 cm in normal years (Bt4 and Bt5 horizons).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 5 to 55 (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons and part of the Bt3 horizon).

The revision of October 2003 updated the taxonomic class from Fine-loamy, isotic Aquic Argicryolls.  The isotic mineralogy class was based solely on the field determined values for sodium fluoride pH.  Laboratory data on 15 bar water to clay ratio does not exist to verify the isotic mineralogy class.
