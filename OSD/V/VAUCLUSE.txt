MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: NcNeil Branch, Mississippi Agricultural Experiment Station, Pearl River County, Mississippi; 1950.

REMARKS: Vaucluse soils have a Bt horizon more than 6 inches thick that is compact, dense, and brittle in 30 to 60 percent of the mass. The brittleness is thought to be due to masses of oxidized iron. This horizon commonly has weak or moderate, medium or coarse subangular blocky structure but in some pedons it appears to be massive. It contains fine roots but medium and coarse roots are not usually present in the brittle part. Since establishment, the series has been classified as: Typic Hapludults, Fragic Paleudults, Typic Fragiudults, Typic Kanhapludults, and (2005) Fragic Kanhapludults.  Further study of the soil is needed to accurately determine the dominant diagnostic characteristics.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 15 inches (Ap horizon)
Argillic and kandic horizon--the zone between a depth of 15 and 58 inches (Bt and Btx horizons).
Fragic soil properties--the zone from 29 to 58 inches (Btx horizon)
