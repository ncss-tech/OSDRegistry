VAMP SERIES

The Vamp series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. The Vamp soils are on low terraces and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquicambidic Haplodurids

TYPICAL PEDON: Vamp silt loam--pasture. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     A--0 to 8 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak thick platy structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine medium roots; common fine and very fine tubular pores, many very fine interstitial pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 10 cm thick)

     C--8 to 25 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots common fine and very fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.6); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 25 cm thick)

     2Ab--25 to 38 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.4); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 15 cm thick)

     3C1--38 to 79 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.4); clear smooth boundary. (25 to 60 cm thick)

     3C2--79 to 91 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; common fine distinct dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) mottles; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine interstitial pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 25 cm thick)

     4Bqkm--91 to 107 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) strongly silica-cemented duripan, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; very hard, extremely firm; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 18 cm thick)

     5C--107 to 152 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) and light olive gray (5Y 6/2) stratified loam, sandy loam and loamy sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) and olive gray (5Y 4/2) moist; massive; slightly sticky and slightly plastic; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

TYPE LOCATION: Washoe County, Nevada; approximately 660 feet west and 250 feet north of the S1/4 corner of sec. 29, T. 19 N., R. 20 E.; USGS Mount Rose NE 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle;latitude 39 degrees 28 minutes 39 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 45 minutes 51 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.4775000 latitude, -119.7641667 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually saturated at depths of 80 to 100 cm during most years.
Mean annual soil temperature: 11 to 12 degrees C.
Depth to duripan: 50 to 100 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  15 to 18 percent clay.

A horizon
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y in some pedons.
Value:  5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist,
Chroma:  1 through 3.

C horizon
Value:  5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist,
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Texture: Average fine sandy loam or loam.  Stratified dominantly with silt loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam and loam, but thin strata of loamy sand, clay loam and silty clay loam are in some pedons.

Bqkm horizon
Strongly silica-cemented duripan is underlain by highly stratified material ranging from loamy sand to silt loam.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Vamp soils are on floodplains and terraces at elevations of 1,345 to 1,405 meters. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in mixed alluvium. The climate is semiarid; mean annual precipitation is 180 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C.; and the frost-free season is 100 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Truckee and Voltaire soils. Truckee and Voltaire soils have mollic epipedons and lack duripans.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained; slow runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity to the duripan.

USE AND VEGETATION: Vamp soils are used principally for pasture, wildlife and urban development. The vegetation is principally saltgrass, rabbitbrush, black greasewood, pepperweed and wiregrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Valleys in southwestern Nevada. The soils are of small extent. MLRA26.
