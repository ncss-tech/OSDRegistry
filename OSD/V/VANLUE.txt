VANLUE SERIES

The Vanlue series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in stratified loamy and silty glaciolacustrine material 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) thick overlying till. They are on lake plains and in shallow lacustrine areas on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Vanlue soils are on lake plains and in shallow lacustrine areas on till plains of late Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Vanlue soils formed in stratified loamy and silty glaciolacustrine material 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) thick and in the underlying till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 914 mm (27 to 36 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 165 days. Elevation is 213 to 244 meters (700 to 800 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the moderately well drained Jenera soils and the somewhat poorly drained Tiderishi soils on slight rises and low knolls, and the very poorly drained Rensselaer soils in depressions and drainageways.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm (0.5 to 1.5 feet) between December and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and glaciolacustrine substratum, and moderately low in the till substratum. Permeability is moderate in the glaciolacustrine material, moderately slow in the lower part of the solum and in the glaciolacustrine substratum, and moderately slow or slow in the till substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: A large proportion is under cultivation, primarily corn, soybeans, wheat, and hay. A few areas are used for specialty crops, such as tomatoes and sugar beets, or remain in native woodland. Native vegetation is deciduous forest, principally ash, beech, elm, maple, and hickory.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Ohio, and possibly northeastern Indiana and southern Michigan; MLRA 99. The series is of small extent.
