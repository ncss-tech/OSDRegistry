VERLAND SERIES

The Verland series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils formed in clayey and loamy sediments of the Beaumont Formation of Pleistocene age.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, hyperthermic Oxyaquic Vertic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Verland silty clay loam--pasture. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 in); dark gray (10YR 4/1) silty clay loam, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; common fine pores; few worm casts; few strong brown organic stains; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. (8 to 41 cm [3 to 16 in])

    Bt1--15 to 76 cm (6 to 30 in); gray (10YR 5/1) clay, gray (10YR 6/1) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and plastic; few fine roots; common fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) and few fine distinct brown (10YR 5/3) iron concentrations; few pressure surfaces; thin clay films on surfaces of peds; few dark concretions 2 to 5mm across; few brown organic stains; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary. (15 to 102 cm [6 to 40 in])

    Bt2--76 to 132 cm (30 to 52 in); gray (10YR 6/1) clay, light gray (10YR 7/1) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and plastic; few fine roots; few fine distinct dark gray (10YR 4/1) and common fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redox features; few pressure surfaces; few medium pitted concretions of calcium carbonate 5 to 10 mm across; thin clay films on surfaces of peds slightly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. Combined thickness of lower Bt's (20 to 152 cm [8 to 60 in])

    Bt3--132 to 152 cm (52 to 60 in); gray (5Y 6/1) clay, light gray (5Y 7/1) dry; moderate fine blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and plastic; few fine roots; common fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) iron concentrations; few medium dark concretions; 10 to 20 mm across; thin clay films on surfaces of peds; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: 
These are the Baldwin and Viterbo series in the same family and the closely similar Dacosta series.
Baldwin soils: have a lithological discontinuity, are poorly drained, receive more rainfall and formed in Mississippi River alluvial deposits.
Viterbo soils: receive more rainfall and are more acid.
Dacosta soils: have a mollic epipedon.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Galveston County, Texas; 1985. The name is coined.

REMARKS: These soils formerly were included with the Midland series.  Classification changed from Vertic Ochraqualfs to Chromic Vertic Epiaqualfs 11/2000 based on typifying pedon description. Another classification change from Chromic Vertic Epiaqualfs to Oxyaquic Vertic Hapludalfs based on new version of Keys to Soil Taxonomy. Further study and characterization data of the series is needed to verify hydrology and classification.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 in) (A horizon)
Argillic Horizon: 15 to 152 cm (6 to 60 in) (Btg horizons)
Vertic features: COLE more than 0.09 in upper 102 cm (40 in)

ADDITIONAL DATA: none
