VAMONT SERIES

The Vamont series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey fluviomarine deposits derived from the Beaumont Formation.  These nearly level soils are on uplands.  Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 20.0 degrees C (68 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1321 mm (52 in).

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
The range in characteristics includes 50 percent or more of the pedon.
Solum thickness is more than 203 cm (80 in).
This cyclic soil ranges from about 1.2 to 3.7 m (4 to 12 ft) from the top of the microhigh to the center of the microlow.  Undisturbed areas have gilgai microrelief with microhighs 15 to 46 cm (6 to 18 in) higher than microlow.
Texture is clay or silty clay.  Slickensides and wedge-shaped peds begin at a depth ranging from 20 to 64 cm (8 to 25 in) below the soil surface.
The soil is usually moist, but during the summer in some years cracks 2.5 to 5 cm (1 to 2 in) wide extend from the surface to depths more than 51 (20 in).
Iron-manganese concretions, 2 to 5 mm across, range from none to common throughout. 

Soil Moisture: An udic soil moisture regime.
The soil moisture control section is 10 to 30 cm (4 to 12 in).
These soils remain moist in some part of the soil moisture control section throughout the year in normal years.
Mean annual soil temperature: 20.6 to 21.7 degrees C (69 to 71 degrees F).

Runoff: high on 0 to less than 1 percent slopes and very high on 1 to 5 percent slopes. 
Ponding: soil is ponded for less than two weeks and aquic conditions may occur during the months of January to March in the microlows. Microhighs become saturated during this time but do not have aquic conditions or reduce. The microlows make up less than 50 percent of the pedon.

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major uses: woodland, pasture with some areas in rice cultivation.
Native vegetation: woodlands are mainly loblolly pine and red oak.  Grasses are mainly species of andropogon, paspalum and panicum.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle size control section: 25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in) (A, Bw, and Bssg horizons)
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 in) (A horizon)
Oxaquic feature: are saturated with water for 30 or more days in most years. In 2 to 4 years out of 10 these soils have aquic soil conditions.
Vertisol feature: Slickensides at a depth of 48 to 203 cm (19 to 80 in) with cracks that extend to a depth of 51 cm (20 in) or more during dry periods.

Additional Comments:  Vamont soils were formerly included with the Vaiden series.  These soils were formerly classified as Aquentic Chromuderts and were reclassified to Oxyaquic Hapluderts 10/94 based on amendment 16 to Soil Taxonomy.  The series was reclassified in April 2000 from Hapluderts to Dystruderts based on lab data.  The series type location was moved to Hardin County, April 2000, to reflect a more central location in the series province with lab data.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Data from the Texas A&M University Soil Characterization Laboratory on sample S98TX199-001; Hardin County, Texas.
