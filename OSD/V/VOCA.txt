VOCA SERIES

The Voca series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium and residuum from grus and granite of pre-Cambrian age. These gently sloping to strongly sloping soils are on undulating plains and footslopes of ridges and hills. Slopes are 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C (66 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm (26 in).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Castell, Click, Lou, and Katemcy soils.
Castell soils: occur on similar surfaces.
Click soils: have loamy-skeletal control sections and occur on shoulders and summits of ridges and hills underlain by pre-Cambrian granite grus 
Katemcy soils: are 50 to 100 cm (20 to 40 in) to schist bedrock and occur on similar surfaces.
Lou soils: have fine-loamy control sections and occur on backslopes, shoulders and summits of ridges and hills 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is slow. Runoff is low on slopes less than 1 percent, medium on 1 to 5 percent slopes, and high on 5 to 12 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for rangeland. A limited acreage is used for growing small grains and sorghums for grazing. Native vegetation consists of mid grasses and short grasses, such as little bluestem, silver bluestem, purpletop, sideoats grama, threeawn, Arizona cottontop, windmillgrass, and sand dropseed. Post oak, blackjack oak, and live oak trees occur in places. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Texas; Southwest Plateaus and Plains Range and Cotton Region, LRR-I; MLRA 82A-Texas Central Basin. This series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED: McCulloch County, Texas; 1970. The name Voca is from a community in southern McCulloch County. 

REMARKS: 
The Voca series type location was redescribed and sampled for characterization in 2009.  It was previously described with a paralithic contact within 150 cm (60 in). The series concept was changed to very deep with no bedrock based on a pit at the type location and other observations.  The activity class was changed to active based on NSSL data.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 in) (A1 and A2 horizons)
Argillic horizon: 23 to 203 cm (9 to 80 in) (Bt1, Bt2, and BCt horizons)

ADDITIONAL DATA: Lab data available from the National Soil Survey Laboratory on pedon number 87TX299001 (samples 87P02410 to 87P02415) from Llano County, TX; Properties and Reconstruction of Pedon 584TX-299-01, Larry T. West, 1984; and Type location in McCulloch County, TX pedon number S09TX307001 (samples 09N02898-09N02903).
