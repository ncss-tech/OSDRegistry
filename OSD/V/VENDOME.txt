VENDOME SERIES

The Vendome series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, knolls and plains.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Aridic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Vendome sandy loam, in grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise indicated.)

    A--0 to 6 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw--6 to 12 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 11 inches thick)

    Bk1--12 to 18 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) cobbly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; 20 percent cobbles 5 percent pebbles; thin lime coats on bottoms of pebbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 13 inches thick)

    2Bk2--18 to 30 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely cobbly loamy sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain structure; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; 35 percent cobbles, 40 percent pebbles; thin lime coats around pebbles; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 20 inches thick)

    2Bk3--30 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely gravelly loamy sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain structure; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; 15 percent cobbles, 60 percent pebbles, thin lime coats around pebbles; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Jefferson County, Montana, 1998.

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretation Records:  MT1017 and MT1016.  Diagnostic features and horizons recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the surface to 6 inches (Ap horizon); a cambic horizon from 6 to 12 inches (Bw horizon); horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation from 12 to 60 inches (Bk1, 2Bk2, 2Bk3 horizons); particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bw, Bk1, 2Bk2 and 2Bk3 horizons).  Vendome soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
