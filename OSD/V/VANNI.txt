VANNI SERIES

The Vanni series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in colluvium derived mainly from limestone, sandstone, and some shale.  These soils are on foothills and have slopes of 10 to 60 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual temperature is 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, carbonatic, frigid Typic
Calcixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Vanni loam, on north facing slightly convex slopes of 24 percent, in rangeland.  When described the soil was moist throughout.  (Colors are for air dry soils unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 7 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; 10 percent gravel; strongly calcareous, lime occurs as flakes; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (7 to 13 inches thick)

    B2--7 to 11 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) heavy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; many fine pores; 3 percent gravel; strongly calcareous, lime occurs as flakes; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 14 inches thick)

    C1ca--11 to 18 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; many fine pores; 3 percent gravel; very strongly calcareous, lime occurs as flakes; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4) gradual, wavy boundary.  (7 to 11 inches thick)

    C2ca--18 to 35 inches; white (10YR 8/2) loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure, slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; 3 percent gravel; very strongly calcareous, lime occurs as flakes; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (9 to 17 inches thick)
    C3ca--35 to 50 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky; few fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; 3 percent gravel; very strongly calcareous, lime occurs as flakes; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 15 inches thick)

    C4--50 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky; many fine and very fine pores; 3 percent gravel; very strongly calcareous; lime occurs as flakes; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Rich County, Utah; about 1 1/3 miles southwest of Laketown; 2,300 feet south and 300 feet east of the NW corner of Section 1, T. 12 N., R. 5 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum and the depth to the calcic horizon typically is about 13 inches but ranges from 7 to 22 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 13 inches thick and moderately or strongly calcareous.  The 10 to 40 inch depths averages 40 to 60 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  The mean annual soil temperature is 37 to 44 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F.  The soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days during the summer months.

The A1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 dry, 3 moist and chroma of 3 to 4 dry, 2 to 3 moist.  It commonly is loam and less commonly very stony loam.  Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 50 percent, with 0 to 15 percent as gravel, 0 to 20 percent as cobble and 0 to 10 percent as stone.  The A horizon is mildly or moderately alkaline.

The B2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry, 2 to 4 moist.  It commonly is loam and less commonly silt loam or gravelly loam with 0 to 30 percent gravel.  The B2 horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline and strongly or very strongly calcareous.

The Cca horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 8 dry, 4 to 7 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry, 3 to 5 moist.  Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 25 percent with 0 to 25 percent as gravel and 0 to 5 percent as cobble.  The Cca horizon is moderately to very strongly alkaline and very strongly calcareous.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Mower series.  Mower soils have shale or sandstone between depth of 20 and 40 inches.
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vanni soils are on foothill slopes that are convex to concave in shape.  Slope gradient commonly is 10 to 30 percent, but ranges to 60 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium weathered mainly from limestone, calcareous sandstone, and some shale.  The mean annual temperature varies from 35 to 42 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation varies from 13 to 17 inches.  The freeze-free period is 50 to 85 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Falula, Slinger, and Cutoff soils.  The Falula soils are less than 20 inches to bedrock.  Cutoff and Slinger soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section.

DRAINEGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; runoff is medium or rapid; permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is dominantly bluebunch wheatgrass, low sagebrush, black sagebrush, juniper, and balsamroot.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Vanni soils are of small extent; about 3,000 acres have been mapped in northeastern Utah.
