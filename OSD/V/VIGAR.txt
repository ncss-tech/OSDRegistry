VIGAR SERIES

The Vigar series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in colluvium. These soils have moderately slow saturated hydraulic conductivity.  These soils are on toe slopes and have slopes of 2 to 9 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 11 degrees C, and mean annual precipitation is 890 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquic Pachic Argiudolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Vigar loam - on a 3 percent slightly concave south-facing slope in pasture. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   A1--0 to 13 centimeters; black (10YR 2/1) loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; moderate very fine granular structure; friable; many fine roots; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.

   A2--13 to 51 centimeters; black (10YR 2/1) loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; moderate fine granular structure; friable; many fine roots; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.

   A3--51 to 61 centimeters; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; firm; many fine roots; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizons is 30 to 76 centimeters.)

   BA--61 to 89 centimeters; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; few fine distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) redoximorphic concentrations; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; firm; many fine roots; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 30 centimeters thick)

   Btg--89 to 119 centimeters; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam; common fine distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) redoximorphic concentrations; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; firm; common faint clay films on faces of peds; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary.

   Bt--119 to 152 centimeters; brown (10YR 4/3) clay loam; many fine distinct dark gray (10YR 4/1) redoximorphic depletions; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; common faint clay films on faces of peds; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.

TYPE LOCATION:  Major Land Resource Area 109  Iowa and Missouri Heavy Till Plain; Scotland County, Missouri Subset; about 1.5 mile south of Granger; 940 feet south and 1,220 feet west of the northeast corner of sec. 14, T. 65 N., R. 10 W.  USGS Wyaconda Quadrangle; 40 degrees 26 minutes 42 seconds north latitude; 91 degrees 58 minutes 12 seconds west longitude; NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Solum thickness - 100 to 152 centimeters or more.
Mollic epipedon thickness - 60 to 90 centimeters, but ranges to 100 centimeters. Reaction - moderately acid to neutral.

A horizon:
Value - 2 or 3, 4 or 5 dry
Chroma - 1 or 2
Texture - loam, but silt loam and silty clay loam are included.

BA horizon:
Value - 2 to 4
Chroma - 1 to 3
Texture - loam or clay loam.

Bt horizon (upper part):
Hue - 10YR or 7.5YR
Value - 3 to 5
Chroma - 1 to 4
It contains some yellowish brown redoximorphic concentrations, and in most pedons, gray or dark gray redoximorphic depletions.

Bt horizon (lower part):
Hue - 10YR or 7.5YR
Value - 4 or 5
Chroma - 1 to 3,
Texture - loam, clay loam or silty clay loam with more than 15 percent sand.
It has variable amounts of gray redoximorphic depletions.

Some pedons have a BC or 2BC horizon.

COMPETING SERIES:  None. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material  colluvium
Surface Morphometry:
	Slope Shape  concave to linear
	Hillslope Position - toeslope
Slope - 2 to 9 percent
Mean annual air temperature - 9 to 13 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation - 840 to 1020 millimeters

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Arbela, Colo, Gara, Lindley, Purdin, Winnegan, and Zook soils.
Arbela - are on terraces below the Vigar soils, have E horizons, and mollic epipedons thinner than 60 centimeters.
Colo and Zook - are on flood plains and do not have an argillic horizon. 
Gara and Lindley - are upslope from the Vigar soils, do not have a mollic epipedon, and formed in till.
Purdin and Winnegan  are on dissected side slopes and low convex interfluves upslope from the Vigar soils and in the Oxyaquic Hapludalfs subgroup. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage Class - An apparent water table has an upper limit of 61 to 91 centimeters during November to April (moderately well drained).
Runoff  medium
Saturated hydraulic conductivity - moderately slow.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used for corn, soybeans, and pasture and meadow. Native vegetation is tall prairie grasses.
