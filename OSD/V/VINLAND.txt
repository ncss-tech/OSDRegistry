VINLAND SERIES

The Vinland series consists of shallow over shale, somewhat excessively drained upland soils formed in residuum weathered from interbedded sandy and silty shales. Slopes range from 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 89 centimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Typic Hapludolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Vinland silty clay loam in native grassland. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

  A--0 to 15 centimeters; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) dry; moderate medium and fine granular structure; hard, friable; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary. (10 to 28 centimeters thick) 

  Bw--15 to 28 centimeters; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; few small fragments of shale; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary. (10 to 25 centimeters thick) 

  C--28 to 41 centimeters; brown (10YR 4/3) and dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silty clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; massive; hard, friable; many small shale fragments; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. (0 to 23 centimeters thick) 

  Cr--41 to 61 centimeters; weathered interbedded sandy and silty shale 

TYPE LOCATION: Shawnee County, Kansas; about 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of Topeka; 69 meters (225 feet) west and 732 meters (2,400 feet) north of the southeast corner of sec. 32, T. 13 S., R. 14 E. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Solum thickness and depth to bedrock: 25 to 51 centimeters 
Mollic epipedon: 18 to 38 centimeters thick
Texture: fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam
Rock fragments up to 8 centimeters: 0 to 15 percent anywhere in the solum 

A horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 2 or 3, 3 to 5 dry
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: silty clay loam
Reaction: moderately acid to slightly alkaline 

Bw horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR to 5Y
Value: 2 to 5, 3 to 6 dry
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: silty clay loam or loam
Reaction: moderately acid to moderately alkaline 

C horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR to 5Y
Value: 4 to 7, 5 to 8 dry
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, and silty clay loam and their shaly counterparts
Reaction: moderately acid to moderately alkaline 

COMPETING SERIES: This includes the Heeland series.
Heeland soils contain more sand and less clay in the series control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform: sloping to steep erosional upland
Slopes: plane to convex gradients of 4 to 30 percent
Parent material: residuum weathered from interbedded sandy and silty shale 
Mean annual temperature: 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 81 to 97 centimeters Thornthwaites Annual P-E Index: 58 to 68

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Basehor, Elmont, Martin, Sibleyville, and Oska soils. 
Basehor, and Sibleyville, soils are on similar nearby landscapes. 
Elmont, Martin, and Oska soils occur higher on the slopes and ridgetops. 
Elmont and Martin also occur on foot slopes. 
Elmont, Martin, Sibleyville, and Oska soils lack bedrock within 51 centimeters and have argillic horizons. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage: somewhat excessively drained
Runoff: medium or rapid
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: moderately high 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used as range, pasture, or hayland. 
Native vegetation is tall grasses and a few trees. 
Dominant trees are oak and hickory. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Kansas; extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Shawnee County, Kansas, 1972. 

REMARKS:
Modified format by LRM in 2/2006 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

09/2008 GJJ removed English units and made some format changes.
