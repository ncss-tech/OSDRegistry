VEAZIE SERIES

The Veazie series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Veazie soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Cumulic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Veazie loam, cultivated field.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap1--0 to 5 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 24 inches thick)

    Ap2--5 to 11 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many fine and medium irregular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 12 inches thick)

    Bw--11 to 32 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 21 inches thick)

    2C--32 to 60 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) very gravelly sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; single grain; loose; few very fine roots; many very fine through medium irregular pores; neutral (pH 6.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  Union County, Oregon; about 100 feet north of river and 100 feet west of road in the SW1/4 SW1/4 section 35, T.2S., R.38E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist and are dry for 70 to 90 consecutive days during the summer, xeric soil moisture regime.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches thick.  Depth to the very gravelly 2C horizon is 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  Organic matter is 2 to 6 percent in the surface and decreases irregularly with depth.  The upper part of the control section has 10 to 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand, but less than 50 percent fine and coarser sand.  

The Ap1 horizon has chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  Texture is loam or silt loam with 0 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles.  It is slightly acid to neutral.  

The Ap2 horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and 1 to 3 dry.  Texture is loam or silt loam with 0 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles.

The Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It has 0 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles.

The 2C has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry and is sand or loamy sand with 35 to 75 percent rock fragments.  In some pedons, there are mottles between 40 and 60 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Dryck and Yakima series.  Dryck and Yakima soils have an aridic soil moisture regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Veazie soils are on flood plains broken by old stream channels at elevations of 750 to 4,000 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  The soils formed in stratified alluvium of mixed mineralogy.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 25 inches.  The mean summer temperature is 64 degrees F.  The mean winter temperature is 30 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F.  The frost free period is 50 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Boyce, Ricco and Voats soils.  Boyce soils are poorly drained and are fine-silty in the upper part of the control section.  Ricco soils are poorly drained and fine textured.  Voats soils have a mollic epipedon 10 to 20 inches thick and are sandy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability in the upper coarse-loamy material and very rapid below.  These soils are frequently to occasionally flooded for brief periods during the snow melt and spring runoff; where protected by man made structures flooding is rare.

USE AND VEGETATION:  This soil is used mainly for irrigated hay and pasture.  Other uses are livestock grazing and wildlife.  Native vegetation is bluebunch wheatgrass, basin wildrye, sedges, rushes and willows.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central and eastern Oregon and southeastern Washington; MLRA 8, 9, 10, 43.  The soils are of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Prineville Area, Crook County, Oregon, 1963.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - from the surface to 32 inches 

Xeric soil moisture regime.

Cumulic feature - a mollic epipedon that is 32 inches thick and an irregular decrease in organic carbon with increasing depth based on the nature of the parent material.

Contrasting particle-size - occurring at 32 inches.

Particle-size control section - from 10 to 40 inches.
