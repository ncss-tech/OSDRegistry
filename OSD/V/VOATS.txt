05/2016--The Voats official series was used in an update project of some riparian areas southeast of Pendleton in Umatilla County, Oregon. Wide ranges in climate were populated in NASIS due to the nature of the lotic riparian areas along several km of a stream. Flooding is rare in incised stream channels in the project areas.

6/2016--This official series description was updated according to SSR1 Technical Note 11--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015).
