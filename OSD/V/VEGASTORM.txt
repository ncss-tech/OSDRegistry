VEGASTORM SERIES

The Vegastorm series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium over lacustrine sediments. Vegastorm soils are on alluvial flats. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, carbonatic, thermic Petronodic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Vegastorm gravelly fine sandy loam, rangeland and wildlife habitat. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered by approximately 30 percent pebbles, consisting of mainly calcium carbonate nodules.

(12 to 20 inches thick) 

	3Bkq2--42 to 60 inches; pale yellow (5Y 8/2) loam, light gray (5Y 7/2) moist; massive; moderately hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine interstitial pores; 20 percent weakly cemented thin, discontinuous lenses; 10 percent irregularly shaped calcium carbonate and silica nodules (rigid, rigid, very strongly cemented); violently effervescent (55 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the fine earth fraction); strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. Kurstan (NV) series is similar. Kurstan soils have less than 40 percent calcium carbonate in the control section and lack lacustrine sediments. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Vegastorm soils are on alluvial flats. These soils formed in mixed alluvium over lacustrine sediments. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Elevations are 2,400 to 3,100 feet. The climate is low-latitude desert, with mild winters and very hot summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with a lesser secondary peak in summer typical of the Mojave Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 7 inches; mean annual air temperature is 57 to 63 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 180 to 240 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Pahrump and Wodavar soils. Wodavar soils have indurated petrocalcic horizons and a loamy-skeletal control section.  Pahrump soils are loamy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low runoff; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly white bursage, shadscale, creosotebush, range ratany and Indian ricegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southern Nevada; MLRA 30. These soils are not extensive.
