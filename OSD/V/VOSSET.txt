VOSSET SERIES

The Vosset series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived rom mixed igneous rocks.  Vosset soils occur on alluvial fans and have slopes of 4 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Calcic Pachic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Vosset very gravelly sandy loam - range. (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 2 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak thin and very thin platy structure parting to weak fine and very fine granular; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine vesicular and intersititial pores; about 2 percent stones on surface; 15 percent cobbles, 30 percent pebbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick)

    B1--2 to 4 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak thin platy structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; common fine, medium and few very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent stones, 10 percent cobbles, 35 percent pebbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 3 inches thick)

    B2t--4 to 14 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) extremely stony sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate coarse blocky structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few coarse and medium, common fine and very fine roots; few fine and very fine random tubular and common fine and very fine interstitial pores; few moderately thick clay films on faces of peds and on rock fragments; 15 percent stones, 15 percent cobbles, 35 percent pebbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary. (6 to 10 inches thick)

    B3--14 to 27 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; single grained; loose, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine interstitial pores; many fine and very fine random tubular pores; 15 percent stones, 15 percent cobbles, 55 percent pebbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 13 inches thick)

    C1ca--27 to 34 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; single grained; loose; few fine and very fine roots; few medium, common fine and many very fine interstitial pores; 15 percent stones, 15 percent cobbles, 55 percent pebbles; moderately calcareous, lime disseminated and as coatings on the underside of pebbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); gradual wavy boundary. (7 to 9 inches thick)

    C2--34 to 60 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand, very dark brown (7.5YR 2/2) moist; single grained; loose; few fine and very fine roots; few medium, common fine, many very fine interstitial pores; 10 percent stones, 15 percent cobbles; 55 percent pebbles; slightly calcareous, lime disseminated and as coatings on the underside of rock fragments and weakly cemented in places; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Iron County, Utah; 1 mile southwest of the Buckhorn enclosure along the roadside; in the NE1/4 of section 9, T. 32 S., R. 8 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon extends to a depth of 20 to 30 inches or more.  The solum above the layer of carbonate accumulation is 14 to 30 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Rock fragments range from 40 to 65 percent in the A1 and B2t horizons, 50 to 85 percent in the C1ca and C2 horizons.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 49 to 50 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 68 to 70 degrees F.

The Al horizon as value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry.

The B2t horizon has hue of lOYR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.  It ranges from very gravelly sandy clay loam to extremely stony sandy clay loam.

The Cca and C horizons have hue of lOYR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry. Texture of individual layers ranges from extremely gravelly or very gravelly coarse sandy loam, to extremely gravelly or very gravelly loamy coarse sand, and to very gravelly sandy clay loam. The Cca and C horizons are mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Hyrum and Pait soils.  Hyrum and Pait soils lack horizons of carbonate accumulation.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vosset soils occur on old alluvial fans at elevators of 6,200 to 6,800 feet.  Slopes range from 4 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 13 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 48 to 50 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 105 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Doyce, Ocambee, Rypod and Hoye soils.  Doyce and Hoye soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section and have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick. Ocambee soil contains more than 35 percent clay in the control section and has a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick.  Rypod soils have a calcic horizon and a frigid temperature regime.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow surface runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Vosset soils are used for rangeland wildlife habitat and recreation.  Vegetation is dominantly big sagebrush, threeawn, bluegrama and sideoats grama grasses, pinyon, juniper and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Utah.  This series is inextensive.
