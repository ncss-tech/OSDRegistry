VERDIGRIS SERIES

The Verdigris series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in silty alluvium on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1041 mm (41 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 14 degrees C (58 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, thermic Cumulic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Verdigris silt loam, in a cultivated field at an elevation of 253 meters (830 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 inches); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) dry; weak medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary.

 A--18 to 71 cm (7 to 28 inches); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable; scattered worm casts; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary. [Combined thickness of the A horizon is 28 to 86 cm (11 to 34 inches).]

 AC--71 to 117 cm (28 to 46 inches); dark brown (10YR 3/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) dry; weak medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable; scattered worm casts; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary. [23 to 76 cm (9 to 30 inches) thick]

 C--117 to 152 cm (46 to 60 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; massive; slightly hard, friable; few fine pores; few fine faint dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) masses of oxidized iron; slightly acid.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Arrington series. Arrington soils are in regions with mean annual precipitation of more than 1194 mm (47 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Verdigris soils are on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The soils formed in silty alluvium. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1194 mm (35 to 47 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 14 to 18 degrees C (57 to 65 degrees F). Elevation is 140 to 475 meters (460 to 1560 feet) above mean sea level. 
Thornthwaite Annual P-E Index ranges from 62 to 82.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cleora, Hepler, Lightning, Mason, Osage, Radley, and Wynona soils. Cleora soils are in the coarse-loamy family. Hepler soils are in similar position and are somewhat poorly drained. Lightning soils are in similar positions, in the fine family, and poorly drained. Mason soils have a regular decrease in organic matter or has less than 0.3 percent organic matter (50 inches) below the soil surface. Osage soils are on broad floodplains and in the fine family and poorly drained. Radley soils have mollic epipedons less than 61 cm (24 inches) in thickness. Wynona soils are somewhat poorly drained.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high. Permeability is moderate. These soils are subject to flooding.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. Corn, sorghum, alfalfa, and wheat are the principal crops. The remainder is used as woodland, rangeland, or pastureland. Native vegetation is grass or lowland deciduous forest with an understory of grass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 76, 112, 116, and 118, and LRU 84A in southeastern Kansas, northeastern Oklahoma, and southwestern Missouri. The type location is in MLRA 112. The series is extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Montgomery County, Kansas, 1913.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 71 cm (28 inches) (Ap and A horizons).

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

12/2015 revision: added metric units and geographic coordinates; sand and clay contents to RIC; added MLRAs 116 and 118 to extent.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Lab data is available for the typical pedon (User Pedon ID 1978KS125017 or Lab Pedon Number 78KS125017) from the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE.
