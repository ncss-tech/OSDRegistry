VAUGHN SERIES

The Vaughn series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy and gravelly alluvium. These soils are on level to nearly level flood plains in the Cretaceous Western Gulf Coastal Plain Major Land Resource Area, MLRA 135B. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Typic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Vaughn gravelly loamy sand, 0 to 3 percent slopes, occasionally flooded in woodland. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

	A--0 to 8 cm (0 to 3 in); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loamy sand; weak medium granular structure; very friable; about 15 percent by volume well-rounded sandstone gravel; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary.

	BA--8 to 25 cm (3 to 10 in); yellowish brown ( 10YR 5/4) gravelly sandy loam, weak fine and medium granular structure; very friable; about 15 percent by volume well-rounded sandstone gravel; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. 

	Bt--25 to 69 cm (10 to 27 in); reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) gravelly sandy loam; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine faint patch clay films on lower faces of peds; about 15 percent by volume well-rounded sandstone gravel;very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.

	2BC--69 to 112 cm (27 to 44 in); brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly loamy sand; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine and medium granular structure; friable; about 40 percent by volume well rounded sandstone gravel and about 10 percent by volume well-rounded sandstone cobbles; strongly acid.

	2C--112 to 203 cm (44 to 80 in); brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly loamy sand; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine and medium granular structure; friable; about 40 percent by volume well rounded sandstone gravel and about 10 percent by volume well-rounded sandstone cobbles; strongly acid.

COMPETING SERIES: No competing series in the same taxonomic class.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Vaughn soils are on flood plains of the Cretaceous Western Coastal Plain, MLRA 135B and in the transitional area to the Ouachita Mountains, MLRA 119. They formed in loamy and gravelly alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 45 to 55 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 63 degrees to 75 degrees F. Thornthwaite annual P-E indices are greater than 64.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Gurdon, Guyton, Murfreesboro, Ochlockonee, Ouachita and Pikecreek soils.
Gurdon soils are on similar landscapes and are somewhat poorly drained.
Guyton soils are on lower landscape positions and are poorly drained.
Murfreesboro soils on higher stream terrace positions and have a fine-loamy control section.
Ochlockonee are on similar landscape positions but lack an argillic horizon.
Ouachita soils have a fine-silty control section and lack an argillic horizon.
Pikecreek soils are on similar landscapes and have a sandy-skeletal control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Vaughn soils are well drained. Runoff is negligible to low and permeability is moderately. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for native pasture and woodland. The vegetation is primarily southern red oak, sweetgum, American sycamore, white oak, and loblolly pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Cretaceous Western Gulf Coastal Plain of southwest Arkansas and possibly southeast Oklahoma. The series is of moderate extent.
