VOLDSETH SERIES

The Voldseth series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium derived from sedimentary, igneous, or metamorphic rock. These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans and valley floors in intermontane basins. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Groveland, Hereimcreek, Martinsdale, and Meagher soils.  The Groveland soils do not have a loamy-skeletal subsoil and are on similar positions.  The Hereimcreek soils have gleyed horizons and are on terrace treads and drainageways.  Martinsdale and Meagher soils do not have redox features.   

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained, low runoff, moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Voldseth soils are used for rangeland and irrigated and nonirrigated cropland. The potential native vegetation is mainly rough fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, green needlegrass, needleandthread, western wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, prairie junegrass, forbs, and shrubs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Voldseth soils are of small extent in west-central Montana. MLRA 43B, 44B, and 46.

SERIES PROPOSED: Meagher County, Montana 2007.  The Voldseth name is a named reservoir on the Lennep Topographic Quadrangle. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 24 cm (Ap and Bt1 horizons).
Argillic horizon - the zone from 14 to 60 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).
Calcic horizon - the zone from 60 to 150 cm (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons).
Particle-size control section - the zone from 14 to 60 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).

Voldseth soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime. 

Redoxomorphic features attributed to irrigation practices.
