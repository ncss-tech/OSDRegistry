VEETEE SERIES

The Veetee series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in residuum fine-grained limestone and dolomite.  Veetee soils are on summits and sideslopes of structural benches on plateaus. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 33 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, semiactive, frigid Aquic Paleudalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Veetee loam - subalpine forest (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     A1--0 to 6 inches (0 to 15 cm); brown (7.5YR 5/4) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4), moist; weak fine subangular blocky parting to strong very fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common fine, medium, and coarse roots throughout, many very fine, and fine tubular and irregular pores; 10 percent gravel; noneffervescent; moderately acid, (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary

     A2--6 to 14 inches (15 to 36 cm); brown (7.5YR 5/4), gravelly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4), moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many fine, medium, and coarse roots throughout, common very fine, fine, and medium, and few coarse tubular pores, 25 percent gravel; noneffervescent; moderately acid, (pH 6.0); abrupt wavy boundary

     Bt--14 to 30 inches (36 to 76 cm); reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6), clay, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), moist; moderate coarse prismatic parting to strong fine angular blocky; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky, very plastic; few fine, medium, and coarse roots throughout; common medium and coarse tubular pores, 25 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 5 percent gravel; noneffervescent; moderately acid, (pH 5.6); many coarse redox and few fine concentrations; clear wavy boundary

     Btss--30 to 43 inches (76 to 109 cm); yellowish red (5YR 5/6), clay, yellowish red (5YR 4/6), moist; moderate medium prismatic parting to strong fine angular blocky; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky, very plastic; few fine and medium roots throughout; few fine and medium tubular pores, 50 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 5 percent gravel; noneffervescent; moderately acid, (pH 5.6); few fine redox depletions; clear wavy boundary

     B't--43 to 59 inches (109 to 150 cm); yellowish red (5YR 5/6), gravelly clay, yellowish red (5YR 4/6), moist; weak coarse prismatic parting to moderate fine angular blocky; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky, very plastic; few fine and medium roots throughout; few fine and medium tubular pores, 25 percent faint clay films on all faces of peds; 20 percent gravel; noneffervescent; moderately acid, (pH 5.6); many redox depletions; abrupt wavy boundary

     R--59 inches (150 to 175 cm); fractured dolomite bedrock

TYPE LOCATION: Coconino County, Arizona; located about 7.4 kilometers (4.6 miles) northeast of Bright Angel Point, Arizona; USGS Quadrangle Little Park Lake; Latitude 35.25972, Longitude -112.02054 Datum WGS84.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: soil moisture control section, in normal years has some moisture retained throughout the year.  Typic udic moisture regime
Mean annual soil temperature - 38 to 42 degrees F
Depth to bedrock - 40 to 60 inches
Depth to argillic - 5 to 20 inches
Depth to redoximorphic features - 10 to 35 inches

A horizons
Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR
Value: 4 to 6 dry, 2.5 to 4 moist
Chroma: 3 or 4 dry, 2 to 4 moist
Fine-earth texture: sandy loam, fine sandy loam
Reaction: strongly acid to neutral

Bt horizons
Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR
Value: 3 to 6 dry or moist
Chroma: 4 to 8, dry or moist
Fine-earth texture: clay
Reaction: very strongly acid to slightly acid
Redoximorphic features: few to many, fine to coarse, faint to prominent mottles; few to many, fine to coarse, faint to distinct depletion zones with a chroma of 2 or less.
Other features: Some argillic horizons may lack slickensides.
Some pedons have E horizons.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: residuum, fine-grained sandstone, limestone, and chert
Landform: summits and sideslopes of hills and ridges on plateaus
Slopes: 0 to 5 percent
Elevation: 8600 to 9200 feet
Mean annual temperature: 36 to 41 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 30 to 35 inches
Precipitation pattern: Wettest months: December through April.  Snow cover typically lasts until May.
Driest month: June, early July
Frost-free period: 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hikai and Angelbright soils.  Angelbright soils are skeletal and do not have an argillic horizon. Hikai and Angelbright soils do not have an aquic feature.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained, medium to high runoff, very slow permeability

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for recreation, wildlife habitat. Native vegetation includes Subalpine Fir, Engelmann spruce, White fir, Douglas-fir, and Quaking aspen.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Kaibab Plateau above 8600 feet in north central Arizona; MLRA 35. The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Soil survey of Kaibab National Forest, Arizona, Coconino County, AZ, 2024

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon (1 to 5 inches)
Argillic horizon (5 to 35 inches)
Aquic features: (12 to 30 inches) that in normal years is saturated with water for 20 consecutive days, or 30 or more cumulative days in March and April following the start of snowmelt.
Redoximorphic features: Consists of mottles, iron oxide concretions, and depletion zones with a chroma of 2 or less.
Name is taken from VT Ranch in history.
