VINGO SERIES

 The Vingo series consists of deep, well drained, moderately
 rapidly permeable soils formed in sandy materials of eolian
 origin.  These soils are on nearly level to sloping uplands.
 Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Paleustalfs

 TYPICAL PEDON:  Vingo loamy fine sand--rangeland.
                 (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

      A1--0 to 18 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loamy fine
 sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak subangular
 blocky and granular structure; loose, very friable; few roots;
 neutral; gradual smooth boundary.  (5 to 20 inches thick)

      B21t--18 to 48 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) fine sandy
 loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic
 structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; soft, very
 friable; few roots and pores; sand grains bridged with clay; few
 wormcasts; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (17 to 35 inches
 thick)

      B22t--48 to 100 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/8) sandy clay
 loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/8) moist; weak medium subangular blocky
 structure; soft, very friable; sand grains bridged with clay;
 patchy clay films; few faint films and threads of calcium
 carbonate; calcareous; moderately alkaline.

 TYPE LOCATION:  Dallam County, Texas; SW corner of sec. 44, Block
 5, CSS Survey; 1 mile northwest of Dalhart on U. S. Highway 87 to
 Sedan Road, then 26 miles west and 100 feet north of Sedan Road
 into rangeland.

 RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 60 inches.
 Depth to secondary carbonates ranges from 37 to 80 inches.

 The A horizon is light brown (7.5YR 6/4), brown (7.5YR 5/2, 5/4;
 10YR 5/3), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), light yellowish brown (10YR
 6/4), or yellowish brown (10YR 5/4).  It is loamy fine sand, fine
 sand, or fine sandy loam.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.

 The B21t horizon is yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), brown (7.5YR 5/4),
 reddish brown (5YR 5/4), or reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6; 5YR 6/6).
 It is fine sandy loam.  The clay content ranges from 14 to 18
 percent.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.

 The B22t horizon is yellowish red (5YR 5/6, 5/8), strong brown
 (7.5YR 5/6), or reddish yellow (5YR 6/6; 7.5YR 6/6).  It is sandy
 clay loam or fine sandy loam and is mildly or moderately alkaline.
 It ranges from noncalcareous to calcareous.  A Btca horizon is
 present at depths greater than 48 inches in some pedons.

 Competing Series:  These include the Brownfield, Dalhart, Dallam,
 Particia, Pratt, Springer, and Vona series.  Brownfield, Patricia,
 Pratt, and Springer soils have mean annual soil temperatures
 greater than 59 degrees F.  In addition, Brownfield and Patricia
 soils have Bt horizons with more than 18 percent clay.  Dalhart
 soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the B2t horizon and a solum
 thickness ranging from 28 to 45 inches.  Dallam soils have 22 to
 35 percent clay in the B2t horizons.  Pratt soils have banded Bt
 horizons.  Springer soils are more moist and receive more than 19
 inches of annual precipitation.  Vona soils are of a drier
 environment and are dry for longer periods of time.

 GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vingo soils are on undulating or hummocky
 landscapes.  Ridges are up to 10 feet high with sideslopes ranging
 up to 8 percent.  The soil formed in sandy materials of eolian
 origin although the lower Bt horizon may not be genetic to the
 overlying soil.  The climate is semiarid, and the mean annual
 precipitation varies from 16 to 19 inches.  Thornthwaite annual
 P-E indices range from 24 to 32.  Mean annual air temperature
 varies from 50 degrees to 57 degrees F.

 GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Dalhart
 and Dallam series and the Perico and Valentine series.  Perico
 soils are calcareous throughout and have more than 18 percent clay
 in the Bt horizons.  Valentine soils lack Bt horizons.

 Drainage and Permeability:  Well drained; very slow surface
 runoff; moderately rapid permeability in the upper B2t horizon and
 moderate in the lower part.

 USE AND VEGETATION:  Used primarily for rangeland.  Native
 vegetation consists of sideoats grama, little bluestem,
 switchgrass, Indiangrass, yucca, and sand sagebrush.  A few areas
 are cropped to grain sorghum and wheat.

 DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western part of Texas High Plains north
 of the Canadian River and possibly in adjoining areas of New
 Mexico, Oklahoma, and southeastern Colorado.  The series is of
 moderate extent.

 SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Dallam County, Texas; 1970.

 REMARKS:  Vingo soils would formerly have been classified in the
 Brown great soil group.
