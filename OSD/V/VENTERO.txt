VENTERO SERIES

The Ventero series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in herbaceous organic material over loamy alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and mica schist .  Ventero soils are on flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 8 to 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, euic, frigid Terric Haplohemists

TYPICAL PEDON: Ventero mucky peat, 0 to 1 percent slopes, in grassland; (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

   Oi--0 to 8 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), peat; very dark brown (10YR 2/2), moist; about 80 percent rubbed fiber and raw herbaceous material; loose, loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine roots throughout; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 15 inches thick)

   Oe--8 to 23 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1), mucky peat, very dark brown (10YR 2/2), moist; about 65 percent rubbed fiber and raw herbaceous material; loose, loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine roots throughout; noneffervescent; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 25 inches thick)

   A--23 to 38 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1), silty clay loam, black (N 2.5/0), moist; 28 percent clay; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable, soft, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; common very fine roots throughout; common very fine dendritic tubular pores; noneffervescent; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 20 inches thick)

   Oa--38 to 44 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2), muck, very dark brown (10YR 2/2), moist; about 15 percent rubbed fiber and raw herbaceous material; loose, loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine roots throughout; noneffervescent; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick)

   Cg--44 to 80 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), very fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), moist; 16 percent clay; massive; very friable, soft, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common very fine roots throughout; common very fine dendritic tubular pores; visible fine sand grain-sized mica; noneffervescent; slightly acid (pH 6.2).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the McLangor and the Tacoosh series.
McLangor soils lack a peat surface.
Tacoosh soils have 10 to 20 percent woody material in the histic epipedon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: herbaceous organic material over loamy alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and mica schist 
Landform: Flood plain
Slopes:  0 to 1 percent
Elevation:  7,500 to 8,500 feet
Mean annual air temperature: 39 to 43 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 8 to 12 inches
Precipitation pattern: Precipitation peaks in July and August occurring as intense summer thunderstorms 
Frost-free period: 85 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Fuertes series.
Fuertes have mollic epipedons and are on stream terraces.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained, low runoff, moderately slow permeability

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used principally as livestock grazing, hayland, and wildfife habitat. Principal native plants are rushes and sedges.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Colorado, high intermountain valleys. LLR E, MLRA 51.  The series is of low extent.
