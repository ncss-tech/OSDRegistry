VOLASH SERIES

The Volash series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash over basalt. Volash soils are on plains. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy, amorphic, frigid Humic Vitrixerands

TYPICAL PEDON: Volash ashy loam - forested, on a 5 percent north-facing slope at an elevation of 2,370 feet. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. All textures are apparent field textures.)

 Oi--0 to 0.5 inches; slightly decomposed needles, leaves, and twigs.

 Oe--0.5 to 1 inch; moderately decomposed needles, leaves, and twigs.

 A1--1 to 5 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) ashy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic and weakly smeary; many very fine and fine roots; many fine irregular and many very fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 6 inches)

 A2--5 to 13 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) ashy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic and weakly smeary; many very fine and fine, and common medium roots; many very fine irregular and many very fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 9 inches thick)

 BA--13 to 26 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) ashy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic and weakly smeary; common very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine irregular and many very fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual smooth boundary. (11 to 16 inches thick)

 Bw1--26 to 37 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) ashy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic and weakly smeary; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine irregular and many very fine tubular pores; 3 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual smooth boundary. (10 to 15 inches thick)

 Bw2--37 to 49 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) ashy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic and weakly smeary; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine irregular and common very fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (10 to 14 inches thick)

 2R--49 inches; basalt

TYPE LOCATION: Klickitat County, Washington; about 3 miles southwest of Trout Lake; 100 feet south and 1,200 feet east of the northwest corner, section 32, T. 6 N., R. 10 E. (Latitude 45 degrees, 58 minutes, 10 seconds N. and Longitude 121 degrees, 35 minutes, 13 seconds W.)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F. The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts for 45 to 60 consecutive days within the 4 months that follow the summer solstice in 6 or more years out of 10. The 0 to 40 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.60 to 0.90 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 30 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 2.0 to 3.0 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 98 percent, and 15 bar water retention of 8 to 12 percent. Depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches. The particle-size control section has 10 to 18 percent field estimated clay and 0 to 10 percent rock fragments . The umbric epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick. Soil reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout.
The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
The Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 4 to 6 dry.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Glen (T), Kreft (T), Sugarbowl, Timberhead and Troutlake series.
Glen series  greater than 60 inches to bedrock; dry for 60 to 75 consectutive days following the summer solstice; pscs with 20 to 30 percent glass and 1.0 to 2.0 percent acid oxalate extractable Al + 1/2 Fe
Kreft series  greater than 60 inches to bedrock; dry for 60 to 75 consectutive days following the summer solstice; pscs with 30 to 60 percent glass and 2.0 to 3.0 percent acid oxalate extractable Al + 1/2 Fe
Sugarbowl series  greater than 60 inches to bedrock; MAST 40 to 43 degrees F; umbric epipedon 10 to 19 inches thick; base saturation (NH4OAc) of less than 50 percent throughout
Timberhead series - greater than 60 inches to bedrock.; pscs with 20 to 35 percent rock fragments; 50 to 85 percent pararock fragments below 40 inches
Troutlake series  greater than 60 inches to bedrock; mollic epipedon 8 to 16 inches thick; base saturation  (NH4Oac) of 60 to 75 percent within upper 30 inches

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Volash soils are on upland plains at elevations of 1,800 to 2,800 feet. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Volash soils formed in volcanic ash over basalt. Summers are cool and dry, winters are cold and wet, with snow cover from December through April. The mean annual precipitation is 52 to 57 inches. The mean January temperature is 24 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is 64 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is 75 to 95 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chemawa, Kingtain, and Trouter soils. Chemawa soils are mesic and are on mountains. Kingtain soils are ashy-skeletal and are on mountains. Trouter soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock, are mesic and are on plains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing, and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is Douglas-fir, grand fir, western larch, and ponderosa pine, with an understory of prince's pine, elk sedge, vine maple, creambush oceanspray, pachystima, common snowberry, Pacific dogwood, trailing blackberry, western hazel, deerfoot vanillaleaf, and longtube twinflower.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Klickitat County, Washington. MLRA 6. The series is of small extent.
