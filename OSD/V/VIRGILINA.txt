MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Halifax County, Virginia, 2004

REMARKS: This series was formerly included with Iredell, Zion, Orange, Wilkes, and Wynott soils. Zion soils are well drained and have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Orange soils have redoximorphic features in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon and have a paralithic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches. Zion and Orange soils are mesic due to the thermic/mesic break in MLRA 136. Wynott soils are well drained and have a paralithic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.
Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 11 inches (A and E horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone between depths of 11 and 32 inches (Btss and Bt horizons)
Lithic contact--the occurrence of unweathered bedrock at a depth of 32 inches (upper boundary of the R horizon)
