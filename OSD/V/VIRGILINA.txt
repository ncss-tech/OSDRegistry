Distribution: Virginia and possibly North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia
Extent: Small

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Halifax County, Virginia, 2004

REMARKS: 
This series was formerly included with Iredell, Zion, Orange, Wilkes, and Wynott soils. Zion soils are well drained and have a lithic contact at a depth of 51 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches). Orange soils have redoximorphic features in the upper 25 centimeters (10 inches) of the argillic horizon and have a paralithic contact at a depth of 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches). Zion and Orange soils are mesic due to the thermic/mesic break in MLRA 136. Wynott soils are well drained and have a paralithic contact at a depth of 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches).
The September 2025 revision reformatted the description to semi-tabular.  No data was changed.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 28 centimeters (11 inches) (A and E horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone between the depth of 28 to 81 centimeters (11 and 32 inches) (Btss and Bt horizons)
Lithic contact--the occurrence of unweathered bedrock at a depth of 81 centimeters (32 inches) (upper boundary of the R horizon)
