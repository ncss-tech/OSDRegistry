VIGIL SERIES

The Vigil series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Vigil soils are on flood-plain steps.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 406 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 8.9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Oxyaquic Ustifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Vigil very gravelly loamy fine sand, on a south facing, simple, 1 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 1,951 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on August 28, 2005 the soil was moist from 0 to 203 cm.  The surface is covered with about 5 percent cobbles.

    A--0 to 8 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2), very gravelly loamy fine sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; very friable, soft, nonsticky, nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots throughout; 35 percent gravel, and 10 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 20 cm thick)

    C1--8 to 46 cm; brown (10YR 5/3), extremely gravelly loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots throughout; 45 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, and 1 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual smooth boundary.  

    C2--46 to 173 cm; brown (10YR 5/3), stratified extremely gravelly coarse sand to extremely cobbly loamy coarse sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; few fine and very fine roots throughout; 35 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles, and 3 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual smooth boundary. (combined thickness of C1, C2 - 45 to 230 cm)

    C3--173 to 203 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) stratified extremely gravelly coarse sand to extremely cobbly loamy coarse sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; few medium distinct brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) dry, and yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist, masses of oxidized iron on bottom of rock fragments; 35 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles, and 3 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4).

COMPETING SERIES:  
Abiquiu (NM) - have a mean annual soil temperature greater than 10.0 C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform - flood-plain steps 
Elevation - 1,860 to 2,350 meters
Slopes - 0 to 3 percent
Parent material - alluvium derived from mixed sources
Mean annual air temperature - 7.2 to 10.0 degrees C.
Mean annual precipitation - 350 to 460 mm

Frost-free period - 100 to 125 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, low runoff, rapid permeability.  These soils are rarely flooded for short periods during the months of May and June.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation consists of cottonwood, thinleaf alder, blue grama, western wheatgrass, squirreltail, and sand dropseed.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana. 

SERIES PROPOSED:  Archuleta County, Colorado, Archuleta soil survey area, 2005.  The name is from a mesa in the survey area.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Redoximorphic concentrations - 173 to 203 cm (C3 horizon)
Endosaturation - saturated from 173 to 203 cm (C3 horizon)
Particle size control section - 25 to 100 cm (part of the C1 and C2 horizons)

Vigil soils have a mesic temperature regime and are in an ustic soil moisture regime with an oxyaquic subclass.

Permeability is estimated at 15.0 to 51.0 cm/hr (rapid).
