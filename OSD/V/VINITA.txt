VINITA SERIES

The Vinita series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed from shales interbedded with thin layers of sandstone of Pennsylvanian age.  These very gently sloping to steep soils are on ridges and side slopes of uplands in the Cherokee Prairies (MLRA 112).  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 40 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is 60 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, thermic Aquic Hapludults

TYPICAL PEDON: Vinita loam--in rangeland.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A--0 to 8 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; hard, friable; sandstone fragments less than 3 inches in diameter make up 10 percent by volume, and fragments 3 to 12 inches in diameter make up 5 percent by volume; very strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (6 to 10 inches thick)

     2Bt--8 to 16 inches; variegated pattern of reddish brown (5YR 4/4), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), and grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay; moderate medium and fine blocky structure; very hard, very firm; clay films on faces of peds; very strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (4 to 15 inches thick)

     2BCt--16 to 28 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay; many medium and fine distinct gray (10YR 6/1) and light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) redoximorphic depletion masses and prominent yellowish red (5YR 4/6) and red (2.5YR 4/6) redoximorphic concentration masses; moderate medium blocky structures; extremely hard, very firm; clay films on faces of peds; few shale fragments; very strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (6 to 15 inches thick)

     2Cr--28 to 34 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) shale with layers of clay that have many medium distinct gray (10YR 5/1) redoximorphic iron depletion masses and yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redoximorphic iron concentration masses; extremely hard, very firm; very strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Craig County, Oklahoma; about 6 miles west of Vinita; in rangeland on the south side of U.S. Highway 60; 1,320 feet south and 2,500 feet east of the northwest corner of sec. 22, T.25N., R.19E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  A discontinuity typically occurs between the A and 2Bt horizons or between the BA and 2Bt horizons.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam. Sandstone fragments less than 3 inches in diameter make up 0 to 10 percent by volume, and fragments 3 to 12 inches in diameter make up 0 to 10 percent by volume.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.

Some pedons have BA horizons.  Where present, the BA horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silty clay loam or clay loam and has a clay content of 27 to 35 percent.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.  Thickness of the BA horizon ranges from 0 to 8 inches.

The 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Redoximorphic iron concentration masses are in shades of gray, brown, or red, and redoximorphic iron depletion masses with chroma of 1 or 2 are always present.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay and has a clay content of 35 to 55 percent. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.

The 2BCt or 2BC horizon has color, texture, and reaction similar to the 2Bt horizon, but the 2BCt or 2BC horizon usually has a weaker grade of structure, less distinct clay films on faces of peds, and contain a few shale fragments.  The base saturation is less than 35 percent by the sum of cations.

The 2Cr horizon has colors in shades of brown or gray.  It is shale with thin strata of clay, and some pedons are underlain with sandstone.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are Peawick, Sacul, and Stapp series. Peawick, Sacul, and Stapp soils have a solum that is more than 102 cm (40 inches) thick.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vinita soils are on very gently sloping to steep ridges and side slopes of uplands in the Cherokee Prairies.  They formed in shales interbedded with thin layers of sandstone of Pennsylvanian age.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  The climate is humid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 37 to 43 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 62 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices is 64 to 80.  The Frost Free Days range from 200 to 220.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bates, Collinsville, and Dennis soils.  Bates, Collinsville, and Dennis soils usually occur on higher landscapes.  Bates, Collinsville, and Dennis soils have more than 50 percent base saturation throughout by the ammonium acetate method.  In addition, Bates soils have a fine-loamy control section. Collinsville soils lack argillic horizons, have a lithic contact within 20 inches, and have a loamy control section.  Dennis soils have a solum more than 60 inches thick.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Vinita soils are somewhat poorly drained.  Runoff is medium to very high, and permeability is slow.  A perched water table is at a depth of 12 to 24 inches from November through April.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for range.  Native vegetation is tall grass prairie.  Scattered sumac and hawthorne occur on a minor percent of the area.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Cherokee Prairies of Oklahoma.  The series is moderately extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Craig County, Oklahoma; 1972.

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretation Record:  Series  OK0075
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 8 inches (A horizon)
Argillic horizon - the zone from 8 to 28 inches (2Bt, 2BCt
horizons)
Udult feature - the occurance of base saturation less than 35 percent in horizon just above the paralithic contact (2BCt horizon).
Aquic condition: the argillic horizon has redoximorphic iron depletion masses with chromas of 2 or less and redoximorphic iron concentration masses with chromas of 4 or more (2Bt, 2BCt horizons)
