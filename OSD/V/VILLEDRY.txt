Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.

The name is coined and shortened to represent a dry version of the Villegreen series which has been reclassified as an Aridic Haplustalf.  Villedry replaces the Villegreen series in the ustic-aridic moisture regime of mlra 69. 

10/2008 LAN WAW updated the format to include metric and updated horizon nomenclature during final correlation of Las Animas County soil survey.
This updates the activity class from active to superactive as supported by lab data. It also changes the BCk horizon to a Bk1 horizon.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by lab sample(s) numbers S99CO-071-007.
