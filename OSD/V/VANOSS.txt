VANOSS SERIES

The Vanoss series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium of Pleistocene age. These soils occur on treads of stream terraces in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 15 degrees C (60 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 920 mm (36 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, thermic Udic Argiustolls

  Bt2--69 to 94 cm (27 to 37 in); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary.  

  Bt3--94 to 127 cm (37 to 50 in); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; few distinct clay films on faces of peds; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizon 41 to 127 cm [16 to 50 in]) 

  C--127 to 241 cm (50 to 95 in); pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; hard, friable; many medium faint grayish brown (10YR 5/2) and brown (10YR 5/3) redox depletions with clear boundaries; few distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron with clear boundaries; moderately acid.
