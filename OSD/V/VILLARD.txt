VILLARD SERIES

The Villard series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 280 cm, and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid Typic Endoaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Villard silt loam, pasture (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 5 cm; undecomposed and slightly decomposed layer of fibric material; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 8 cm thick)

    Ag--5 to 18 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) silt loam, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; moderate thin platy structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; few small gravel; common fine prominent brown (7.5YR 4/4) redox concentrations; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 13 cm thick)

    Bg1--18 to 30 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) silty clay loam, gray (10YR 6/1) dry; weak thin platy structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; common fine prominent brown (7.5YR 4/4) redox concentrations; slightly effervescent; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 38 cm thick)

    Bg2--30 to 58 cm; olive gray (5Y 5/2) silty clay loam, light gray (5Y 7/2) dry; weak thin platy structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; many fine and medium prominent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) redox concentrations; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual smooth boundary. (25 to 38 cm thick)

    Bg3--58 to 86 cm; gray (5Y 5/1) loam, gray (5Y 6/1) dry; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many fine and medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) redox concentrations; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 30 cm thick)

    2C--86 to 150 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly sand, yellow (10YR 7/6) dry; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 55 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2).

TYPE LOCATION:  Lewis and Clark County, Montana; 2,100 feet east, and 700 feet south of the NW corner of sec. 10, T. 10 N., R. 3 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil temperature - 5.5 to 8.3 degrees C.
Moisture control section - between 10 and 30 cm from the mineral soil surface.
Depth to 2C horizon - 50 to 100 cm from the mineral soil surface.
Depth to seasonal high water table - 30 to 60 cm from the mineral soil surface.
Where color values of 5 dry and 3 moist occur the horizon is too thin to meet the requirements of a mollic epipedon when mixed to a depth of 18 cm.
