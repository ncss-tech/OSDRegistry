VAUGHNSVILLE SERIES

The Vaughnsville series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are deep to dense till. They formed in loamy glaciolacustrine material 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) thick and in the underlying till. These soils are on beach ridges on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 864 mm (34 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Adamstown, Beech, Blakeslee, Cazenovia, El Dara, Funkstown, Hilton, Kidami, Lima, Miami, Mt. Zion, Pevely, Rainsville, Rawson, Richland, Shawtown, and Summitville series. All of these soils except Cazenovia and Summitville series have hue yellower than 5YR in the upper part of the series control section. Cazenovia soils formed entirely in till and do not have a densic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Summitville soils formed in colluvium and residuum and have rock fragments of shale or siltstone lithology.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Vaughnsville soils are on beach ridges on lake plains of late Wisconsin age. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Vaughnsville soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loamy glaciolacustrine material and in the underlying fine or moderately fine textured till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 914 mm (27 to 36 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 165 days. Elevation is 183 to 244 meters (600 to 800 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the well drained Belmore, Fox, Oshtemo, and Shawtown soils along backslopes of beach ridges. The somewhat poorly drained Aurand and very poorly drained Mermill soils are on less prominent footslopes and toeslopes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 61 to 107 cm (2 to 3.5 feet) between January and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is very low to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or moderately low in the solum, and low in the substratum. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the loamy material, slow or moderately slow in the lower part of the solum, and slow or very slow in the substratum. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. Principal crops are corn, soybeans, wheat, oats, and hay. Native vegetation is mixed deciduous forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Ohio; MLRA 99. The series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Putnam County, Ohio, 1930.

REMARKS: Vaughnsville was formerly classified as Aquic Hapludalfs.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 20 cm (Ap horizon).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 20 to 76 cm (Bt horizon).
Densic contact: at 114 cm (top of the 2Cd horizon).
Aquic conditions: iron depletions with chroma of 2 in all horizons below a depth of 51 cm.

Supporting laboratory data is needed to confirm the presence of densic materials in the 2Cd horizon. 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory characterization data (HK-20) from The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory is available for the original typical pedon, which is from the same general area.

Representative data mapunit is DMU ID 130064.
