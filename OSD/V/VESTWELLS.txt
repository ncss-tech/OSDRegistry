VESTWELLS SERIES

The Vestwells series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils. Vestwells soils that formed in sandy and loamy eolian deposits from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. They are on nearly level to very gently sloping plains.  The mean annual precipitation is 406 mm (16 in) and the mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F). Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Runoff is negligible on 0 to 3 percent slopes. Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used almost entirely for rangeland. Native climax vegetation is tall and mid grasses, with tall grasses tending to dominate. This site is dominated by little bluestem and sand bluestem along with taller dropseed species. The remainder is mid and short grasses such as sideoats grama, sand dropseed, hooded windmillgrass, sand lovegrass, sand paspalum, fall witchgrass, hairy grama, needle and thread, and perennial threeawn. Sand sage, shinoak, and skunkbush are also present. This soil has been correlated to the Sandy (R077DY046TX) range site in MLRA-77D.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern High Plains, Southern Part (MLRA 77D in LRR H); of eastern New Mexico. The series is minor in extent.
