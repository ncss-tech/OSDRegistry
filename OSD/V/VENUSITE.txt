VENUSITE SERIES

The Venusite series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in granitic alluvium. The Venusite soils are on alluvial fans and fan aprons. Slope ranges from 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, nonacid, thermic Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  On Venusite-Uxo association, 2 to 15 percent slopes at an elevation of 3,550 feet. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on August 13, 1997, the soil was dry throughout.)  The soil surface is partially covered by 60 percent gravel, 1 percent cobbles, and 4 percent stones.

   A -- 0 to 3 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, few fine roots throughout; noneffervescent; 60 percent gravel, 1 percent cobbles, and 4 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick)

   Bw -- 3 to 10 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine, few medium roots throughout; noneffervescent; 40 percent gravel, 1 percent cobbles, and 1 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 8 inches thick)

   C1 -- 10 to 23 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; moderately hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, few fine roots throughout; noneffervescent; 50 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, and 1 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.

   C2 -- 23 to 32 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, few fine roots throughout; noneffervescent; 45 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. 

   C3 -- 32 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) stratified extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand and extremely gravelly coarse sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots throughout; noneffervescent; 45 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Fig (T AZ), Nolena (T NV), and Wikieup (T AZ) series. Fig soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 4 to 20 inches. In addition, Fig soils are moist in some part of the soil moisture control section for more than 20 days cumulative between July and September. Nolena and Wikieup soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 inches or less. In addition, Wikieup soils are moist in some part of the soil moisture control section for more than 20 days cumulative between July and September.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Venusite soils are on alluvial fans and fan aprons. Slope ranges from 2 to 15 percent. The soils formed in material from granitic alluvium. Elevations are 3,200 to 4,000 feet. The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm winters. Most precipitation comes in the winter but in some areas it is sporadic. The mean annual precipitation is 4 to 7 inches. The mean annual temperature is 61 to 66 degrees F. Mean July temperature is about 78 degrees F., and mean January temperature is about 42 degrees F. The frost-free season is 240 to 300 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Khyber (T),  and Uxo (T) soils. Khyber soils are on fan remnants and have argillic horizons. Uxo soils are on similar landscape positions and have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very low or low runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Venusite soils are used for military exercises and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly creosotebush, Nevada ephedra, California buckwheat, blackbrush and desert needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mojave Desert of southeastern California. MLRA 30. The series is of small extent.
