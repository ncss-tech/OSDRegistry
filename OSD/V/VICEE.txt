VICEE SERIES

The Vicee series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metavolcanic rocks.  Vicee soils are on mountains. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 686 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TYPE LOCATION:  Carson City County, Nevada; in the Carson Range about 3 miles west of Carson City; approximately 152 meters west and 152 meters north of the southeast corner of section 15, T. 15 N., R. 19E.; USGS Carson City 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; 39 degrees 9 minutes 28 seconds north latitude and 119 degrees 49 minutes 38 seconds west longitude, NAD83; UTM zone 11N, 255718E, 4338083N, NAD83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Mollic epipedon thickness - 18 to 38 centimeters.

Depth to bedrock - 100 to more than 152 centimeters to a paralithic contact.

Mean annual soil temperature - 6 to 8.5 degrees C.

Soil moisture - These soils are usually moist but are dry during late summer and autumn; Xeric moisture regime.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 10 to 18 percent;
Rock fragments: 10 to 20 percent, mainly gravel.  Lithology of fragments is metavolcanic rock.

Base saturation - 50 to 75 percent.

Sodium fluoride pH - 8.5 to 9.0 in more than one-half of the control section.


A and AC horizons
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y.
Value:  4 through 6 dry; after mixing the upper 18 cm the dry value is 5 in some pedons.
Chroma: 1 through 3, dry or moist.
Organic matter content: 1 to 4 percent.


C horizons
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y.
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 1 through 3, dry or moist.
Texture: Very fine sandy loam,loam, or gravelly very fine sandy loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vicee soils are on mountains.  Elevations range from 1,829 to 2,286 meters.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metavolcanic rocks.  The climate is continental with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 508 to 889 millimeters, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 40 to 75 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cagwin, Koontz, Sutro, and Toiyabe soils.  Cagwin soils have a sandy control section and have bedrock within a depth of 50 centimeters.  Koontz soils have a loamy-skeletal control section and have bedrock within a depth of 50 centimeters.  Sutro soils have bedrock within a depth of 100 centimeters.  Toiyabe soils have a sandy control section and have bedrock within a depth of 50 centimeters.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; high surface runoff; moderate permeability (moderately high or high saturated hydraulic conductivity).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Vicee soils are used for timber production, wildlife habitat, and watershed.  The vegetation is principally a forest canopy of Jeffrey pine, red fir, incense cedar, manzanita, and snowbrush ceanothus.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  These soils are not extensive with about 1,093 hectares of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 22A.
