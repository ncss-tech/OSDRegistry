VICTORIA SERIES

The Victoria series consists of very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey deltaic and marine sediments in the Beaumont Formation of Late Pleistocene age.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on the South Texas coastal plain.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 in).

Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 76 to 127 cm (30 to 50 in) or more in the microlows and 31 to 76 cm (12 to 30 in) in the microhighs.
The soils are calcareous throughout, except for the A horizon which is noncalcareous in microlows in some pedons that are not cultivated.
Mean annual soil temperature: 22.2 to 22.8 degrees C (72 to 73 degrees F)
Depth to salt and gypsum accumulations: 127 to 165 cm (50 to 65 in)

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Arroyada, Catarina, Coquat, Cotulla, Dosrios, , Lasalle, Mercedes, Montell, Monwebb, and Victine series.
Arroyada and Coquat soils: are somewhat poorly drained, have an ochric epipedon, and formed in Holocene age alluvium on flood plains.
Catarina soils: are moderately well drained, have an ochric epipedon, and formed in clayey alluvium and colluvium derived from sediments of Eocene age. 
Cotulla soils: have an ochric epipedon, formed in thick beds of calcareous, saline, clayey sediments that are, in places, interbedded with shale and sandstone, and occur in areas with mean annual precipitation ranging from 48 to 66 cm (19 to 26 in).
Dosrios soils: are moderately well drained, have a densic layer, and are formed in moderately saline clayey marine sediments overlying clayey residuum derived from mudston of Tertiary age.

Edroy soils: are poorly drained and are in depressions

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is very slow.  Runoff is highmedium on 0 to 1 percent slopes and very high on 1 to 3 percent slopes.  Water enters the soil rapidly when it is dry and cracked and very slowly when it is moist.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used for crop production with some areas used for livestock grazing and forage production.  Some areas in crop production have supplemental irrigation where suitable water is available.  Crops are mainly grain sorghum, cotton, and corn with some small areas in vegetables.  Native grasses are mainly little bluestem, seacoast bluestem, fourflower trichloris, vine-mesquite, and indiangrass.  Improved pasture is mainly coastal bermudagrass or Kleingrass.  Native woody plants are invaders and consist mainly of mesquite trees, spiny hackberry, huisache, brazil, and lotebush.  The ecological site is Blackland, PEZ 3124-44 (R150AY526TX).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Gulf Coast Prairies (MLRA 150A in LRR T) in the Coastal Bend area of South Texas.  The series is extensive.

REMARKS: This is a Benchmark Series.
Classification changed from Udic Pellusterts to Typic Haplusterts in 11/2000 based on typical pedon description.  The series type location was moved in 05/2005 to a site with characterization data.  Classification changed 05/2005 from Typic Haplusterts to Sodic Haplusterts based on characterization data from several pedons across the series province.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon: 0 to 94 cm (0 to 37 in). (Ap, Bss1, and Bss2 horizons)
