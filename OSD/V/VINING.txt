VINING SERIES

The Vining series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on basalt plains and terraces.  They formed in eolian material and alluvium from mixed sources.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Vining very stony fine sandy loam - sagebrush and grass.
 (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 4 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) and brown (10YR 5/3) pale brown (10YR 6/3 crushed) very stony fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2 crushed) moist; weak very thin platy structure parting to weak very fine granular; slightly hard, very friable; many very fine and common fine roots; many very fine irregular and tubular pores; about 3 percent angular stones and 7 percent angular cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)

    Bw1--4 to 7 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) pale brown (10YR 6/3 crushed) very fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2 crushed) moist; weak coarse and medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, few fine, and medium roots; many very fine pores; 3 percent basalt stones and 7 percent angular cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)

    Bw2--7 to 13 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) pale brown (10YR 6/3 crushed) fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2 crushed) moist; weak coarse and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, few fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine irregular and common very fine tubular pores; 5 percent basalt stones and angular cobbles and few gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 13 inches thick)

    C--13 to 27 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) cobbly fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; few firm krotovinas (cicada); 20 percent basalt stones, angular cobblestones, and angular gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 27 inches thick)

    2R--27 inches; basalt; lime coating on surface and in pores; calcareous material in cracks.

TYPE LOCATION:  Blaine County, Idaho; 25 feet north of road; 2,640 feet east and 660 feet north of the southwest corner of section 27, T. 8 S., R. 26 E.

A horizon
Value - 5 through 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma - 2 or 3 dry or moist
Reaction - neutral or slightly alkaline

Bw horizon
Value - 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist
Chroma - 2 through 4 dry or moist

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Adkins, Bijorja, Chedehap, Clems, Drewsey, Haybourne, Irrigon, McClenden, Prosser, Rebel, Royal, Scooteney, Sohappy, and Wiehl series.  Adkins, Chedehap, Clems, Drewsey, Haybourne, McClenden, Rebel, Royal, and Scooteney are more than 40 inches deep to a lithic or a paralithic contact.  Bijorja and Irrigon have mean annual soil temperatures of 53 degrees F. or more.  Wiehl are over a paralithic contact.  Prosser soils have a very fine sandy loam control section.  Sohappy soils are deep to a duripan.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vining soils are on level to hilly basalt plains and terraces covered by eolian and alluvial material of mixed origin.  Most slopes are short and irregular.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent, but are principally from 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 2,500 to 5,000 feet.  The climate is semiarid and has relatively dry summers.  Average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches, and the average annual air temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F.  Frost free season is 80 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Escalante, Portneuf, Quincy, Royal, and Trevino soils.  All of these except Trevino are deeper than 40 inches.  Trevino soils are less than 20 inches deep to bedrock.  These soils are all on landscape positions similar to Vining soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, slow or medium runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used primarily for rangeland.  Vegetation in the potential natural plant community is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, Thurber needlegrass, Indian ricegrass, and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Idaho and Southeastern Oregon.  The series is moderately extensive.
