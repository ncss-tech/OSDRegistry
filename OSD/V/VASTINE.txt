VASTINE SERIES

The Vastine series consists of very deep, poorly to somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium, and fine-loamy over sandy and gravelly alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and mica schist.  Vastine soils are on low stream terraces and floodplains with slopes 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:   Vastine loam - grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 10 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft, very friable; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual smooth boundary.  (10 to 24 inches thick)

    Bg--10 to 30 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; many large prominent mottles of dark gray (N 4/) and olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly plastic; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (14 to 34 inches thick)

    2Cg--30 to 60 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) sand, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; common medium distinct olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) mottles; single grained; loose; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).

Gerrard soils have sandy-skeletal substratums at depths of 10 to 20 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform: Low stream terraces and flood plains
Slopes: 0 to 5 percent
Elevation: 7,500 to 8,200 feet (2,286 to 2,743 meters)
Water table: 1 to 2 feet (0.30 to 0.61 meters); keeps soil wet in most seasons
Mean annual air temperature: 40 to 46 degrees F (4.4 to 7.8 degrees C)
Mean summer temperature: 59 to 61 degrees F (15.0 to 16.1 degrees C)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Medano and Nortonville soils.  Medano soils are coarse-textured.  
Nortonville soils have a calcic horizon.
Gerrard soil have sandy-skeletal substratums at depths of 10 to 20 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly to somewhat poorly drained; low runoff; moderate and moderately slow permeability.
Typically the water table fluctuates with the height of the water in the adjacent streams.
These soils are sometimes flooded in the spring.
Water tables may drop as much as 5 feet in the driest parts of the year.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally as native pastureland and for irrigated meadows.  Occasionally, some areas are used for small grains.  Principal native plants are sedges, rushes, saltgrass, and other water-tolerant grasses and plants.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  High mountain valleys of central Colorado and adjacent parts of New Mexico; LLR E, MLRA 51. The series is of moderate extent.

REMARKS:  
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
This soil is saturated from 10 to 80 inches (25 to 203 cm) and has redoximorphic features in this part of the pedon. 
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 10 inches, (0 to 25 cm) (A horizon).

The superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Lakewood MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data.
