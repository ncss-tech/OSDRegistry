VEET SERIES

The Veet series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium derived from andesitic, welded tuff, and granitic rocks. Veet soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, fan skirts, inset fans, and axial stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 225 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON: Veet very gravelly sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

 A--0 to 13 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few medium and coarse and many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 25 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 15 cm thick) 

 Bw--13 to 57 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common coarse and many very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 30 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (20 to 45 cm thick) 

 Bk1--57 to 89 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) extremely gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 50 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; common distinct secondary calcium carbonate pendants on bottom of rock fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (15 to 120 cm thick) 

 Bk2--89 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly loamy coarse sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 30 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; common distinct secondary calcium carbonate pendants on bottom of rock fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cewat, Darkcanyon, Drinkwater, Lonegrave, Finley, Kiona, Minat, Nibbs, Veta and Wifton series. 

All of these soils except Lonegrave and Wifton are moist for less than 10 days from June to September. Cewat soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Darkcanyon and Lonegrave soils are 50 to 100 cm deep to hard bedrock. Finley soils have secondary calcium carbonate and silica coats on bottom of rock fragments in Bw horizon and have an extremely gravelly 2C horizon. Kiona soils have textures of silt loam, very fine sandy loam or loam in the control section. Minat soils are 50 to 76 cm to bottom of Bw horizon. Nibbs soils contain 15 to 25 percent clay in the Bw horizon. Wifton soils contain 60 to 80 percent rock fragments. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Veet soils are on fan remnants, inset fans, and fan skirts. These soils formed in mixed alluvium derived from welded tuff, andesitic and granitic rock. Elevations are 1,296 to 2,286 meters. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 9 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 140 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Handpah soils on adjacent and higher older fan surfaces. Handpah soils are shallow to a hardpan. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very low to medium runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Veet soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is principally Wyoming big sagebrush, galleta, spiny hopsage and Nevada ephedra. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West central Nevada. The series is of small extent. MLRA 26, 27, 29, 28A and 28B.
