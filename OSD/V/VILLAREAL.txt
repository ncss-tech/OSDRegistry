VILLAREAL SERIES

The Villareal series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived from andesite.  Villareal soils are on mesas and scarp slopes on sides of mesas.  Slopes range from 3 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 559 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 4.4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Villareal very channery loam, on a southwest facing, simple, 12 percent slope in woodland at an elevation of 2,728 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on August 10, 1998 the soil was moist from 0 to 13 cm and dry from 13 to 48 cm.  The surface is covered by 15 percent andesite channers.

        A--0 to 13 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very channery loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; many very fine and common medium roots; few fine tubular pores; 30 percent channers and 15 percent flagstones; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 20 cm thick)

        Bw1--13 to 36 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very flaggy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic; common medium and many very fine roots; few fine tubular pores; 10 percent channers and 40 percent flagstones; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary.

        Bw2--36 to 48 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very flaggy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few fine tubular pores; 10 percent channers and 40 percent flagstones; moderately acid (pH 6.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (combined thickness of the Bw horizons is 15 to 43 cm)

        R--48 to 58 cm; indurated andesite.
