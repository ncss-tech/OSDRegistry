VOCK SERIES

The Vock series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in mixed igneous and metamorphic colluvium and alluvium.  Vock soils are on mountains and hills and have slopes of 30 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Ustic Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON: Vock very cobbly sandy loam - rangeland. (Color for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 6 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) very cobbly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel, 20 percent cobble, 10 percent stone; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 6 inches thick)

    Bw1--6 to 11 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) gravelly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots matted around rock fragments; common very fine tubular pores; 25 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 7 inches thick)

    Bw2--11 to 16 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 45 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (4 to 7 inches thick)

   2Cr--16 to 60 inches; granite.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Vock series are on mountains and hills at elevations of 5,000 to 7,000 feet.  These soils formed in mixed igneous and metamorphic colluvium and alluvium.  Slopes range from 30 to 65 percent.   The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 52 to 55 degrees F.  The frost free period is 150 to 165 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Elements series.  Elements soils are very deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; very high runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Present vegetation is turbinella oak, desert ceanothus, yellowleaf silktassel, and singleleaf pinyon.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Arizona.  This series is of moderate extent.  MLRA is 38.
