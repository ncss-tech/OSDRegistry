VENADITO SERIES

The Venadito series consists of deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium, fan alluvium, and stream alluvium derived from shale. Venadito soils are on alluvial fans on valley sides, low stream terraces, and flood plains on valley floors. Slope is 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Very-fine, smectitic, mesic Chromic Haplotorrerts

TYPICAL PEDON: Venadito clay loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, fine and coarse roots; few very fine irregular pores; vertical cracks 1.5 inches wide; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick)

    Bss--3 to 35 inches; reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) clay, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; massive; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine, fine and coarse roots; few very fine irregular pores; common intersecting slickensides; vertical cracks .25 inch wide; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (25 to 40 inches thick)

    C--35 to 60 inches; reddish brown (2.5YR 5/4) clay, reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Cibola County, New Mexico; Atarque Lake Quadrangle; about 3 miles north of the Atarque Ranch Headquarters; 500 feet east and 175 feet north of the southwest corner of Sec. 19. T. 7 N. R. 18 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture - Intermittently moist in some part of the SMCS July through September and December through March. The soil is driest in May and June. Ustic aridic soil moisture regime.

Soil Temperature: 50 to 55 degrees F.

Sodicity: SAR of less than 12

Vertical Cracks: cracks about 0.5 inches wide extend from the surface to depths of 20 to 35 inches, and remain open about 135 days

A horizon
Hue: 2.5YR, 5YR
Value: 3 to 5, dry or moist
Chroma: 3 to 6, dry or moist
Texture: sandy clay loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, clay with more than 30 percent clay

Bss and C horizons
Hue: 2.5YR, 5YR
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 3 to 6, dry or moist
Clay content: 60 to 80 percent

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competitors.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Venadito soils are on alluvial fans on valley sides, low stream terraces, and flood plains on valley floors. Slopes are 0 to 6 percent. Elevations range 6,100 to 7,500 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is 48 to 54 degrees F. The frost-free period is 110 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Catman, Flugle, Goesling, Hickman, Suwanee and Teco soils. Flugle, Goesling and Teco soils have argillic horizons. Hickman and Suwanee soils have less than 35 percent clay.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to very high runoff; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for livestock grazing and as irrigated farmland. Present vegetation is western wheatgrass and alkali sacaton.  Principal crops are alfalfa, small grains, and potatoes.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West central New Mexico. MLRA 35, LRR-D. This series is of small extent.
