VICK SERIES

 The Vick series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly
 permeable soils that formed in a thin mantle of loess overlying
 loamy and clayey Coastal Plain sediments.  These soils are on
 broad, level or nearly level, terrace uplands.  Vick soils are
 saturated above the clayey layer to a depth of 0.5 to 2 feet of
 the surface for periods of 8 to 16 weeks during winter and early
 spring.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, siliceous, active, thermic Glossaquic Hapludalfs

 TYPICAL PEDON:  Vick silt loam on a 0.5 percent slope in loblolly
 pine and hardwood woodland.

      IIB22t--25 to 36 inches; mottled light brownish gray (10YR
 6/2) and dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silty clay; moderate

 few thin clay films on surfaces of peds; few thin gray (10YR 6/1)
 silt coats on surfaces of peds in upper part; strongly acid; clear
 wavy boundary.  (5 to 15 inches thick)

      IIB23t--36 to 45 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silty
 clay loam; many medium distinct light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) and

 TYPE LOCATION:  Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana; 4 miles south of
 Centerpoint, 1.4 miles east of Ruby post office on parish road,
 150 feet south on woods trail, 10 feet west of trail.  SW1/4NE1/4,
 sec. 36, T. 3 N., R. 2 E.

 RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from
 50 to about 80 inches.  Depth to clayey IIB horizons ranges from
 20 to 35 inches.  The A and B horizons above the IIB horizon have
 3 to 10 percent total sand content.

 The A1 or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma
 of 2 to 4.  The A2 horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value
 of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Reaction ranges from very
 strongly acid to medium acid.

 The B1 and B2t horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 5, and chroma
 of 4 to 6.  Typically, the texture is silt loam, but silty clay
 loam is within the range.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid
 to medium acid.  Mottles in shades of gray and brown range from
 few to many.

 The B part of the B&A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6,
 and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  The A
 part of the B&A horizon is a grayish uncoated silt.

 The IIBt horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and
 chroma of 2, 4, or 6.  It is clay or silty clay in the upper part
 and silty clay loam in the lower part.  Reaction ranges from very
 strongly acid to medium acid.

 The IIIBt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of
 2 to 6.  It is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.  Reaction
 ranges from strongly acid to neutral.

 Competing Series:  These are the Longview series in the same
 family and the Coteau, Egypt, Fred, Frizzell, Glenmora,
 Keithville, Kolin, Metcalf, and Vidrine series.  Coteau, Egypt,
 Fred, Frizzell, Glenmora, and Longview soils lack clayey IIB
 horizons.  Keithville and Kolin soils do not have low chroma
 mottles in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.  Metcalf
 soils have more than 15 percent sand in all horizons above the
 clayey IIB horizon.  Vidrine soils have coarse-silty over clayey
 control sections and are on mounds.

 GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vick soils are on nearly level fluvial
 terraces of late Pleistocene age.  Slopes range from 0 to 2
 percent.  The soils formed in a thin layer of loess over clayey
 and loamy Coastal Plains sediments.  The climate is warm and
 humid.  The mean annual temperature is about 66 degrees F., and
 the mean annual rainfall is about 61 inches near the type
 location.

 GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Kolin
 series, and the Gore, Guyton, McKamie, and Wrightsville series.
 Gore and McKamie soils are on sideslopes and have fine textured
 control section.  Guyton and Wrightsville soils are in shallow
 depressions and are dominantly gray throughout the solum.

 Drainage and Permeability:  Vick soils are somewhat poorly
 drained.  Runoff is slow and permeability is slow.  A perched
 seasonally high water table is at a depth of 0.5 to 2 feet for
 periods of 8 to 16 weeks during December through April.

 USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of Vick soils are in woodland or
 pastureland.  Loblolly pine, shortleaf pine, southern red oak,
 post oak, and water oak, are dominant.  Soybeans are the main crop
 grown in areas that are cultivated.

 DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Louisiana.  These soils are not
 extensive.

 SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana; 1980.
