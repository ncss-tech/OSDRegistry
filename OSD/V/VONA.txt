VONA SERIES

The Vona series consists of very deep, well or somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian or partly wind reworked alluvial materials.  Vona soils are on hills, ridges, plains and uplands and are frequently parallel to major river channels.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 36 centimeters (14 inches) and means annual temperature is about 10 degrees C. (50 degrees F.)

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Vona fine sandy loam, rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

  A--0 to 13 centimeters (0 to 5 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 20 centimeters (4 to 8 inches) thick)

  AB--13 to 20 centimeters (5 to 8 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; slightly hard, very friable; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches) thick)

  Bt--20 to 61 centimeters (8 to 24 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak very coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate coarse subangular blocks; hard, friable; few distinct clay films on both horizontal and vertical faces of peds, and clay bridging between sand grains; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 66 centimeters (4 to 26 inches) thick)

  Bk1--61 to 76 centimeters (24 to 30 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak and moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; few faint clay films and a small amount of clay bridging between sand grains; few fine calcium carbonates occurring as concretions; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 23 centimeters (3 to 9 inches) thick)

  Bk2--76 to 127 centimeters (30 to 50 inches); very pale brown (10YR 7/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3); moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable; few fine secondary calcium carbonate occurring as concretions, and in thin seams and streaks; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (15 to 51 centimeters (6 to 20 inches) thick)

  Bk3--127 to 152 centimeters (50 to 60 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; single grain; loose; few fine secondary calcium carbonate concretions but less than in the horizon above; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).
