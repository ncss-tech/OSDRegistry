These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on drainageways. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 23 degrees C (73 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 533 mm (21 in).

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Zapata County, Texas, 2009. This series was proposed in Zapata County, Texas, 2009. The name comes from an arroyo in the central part of Zapata County, Texas.

REMARKS: These soils were formerly included in the Montell series. The Montell series typically are not mapped in floodplains. This series will be used for areas mapped as Montell flooded in published soil surveys.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle size control section: 25 to 102 cm (10 to 40 in) (Bnss and Bnssyz horizons). 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 in)(A horizon). 
Slickensides: 25 to 163 cm (10 to 64 in)(Bnss and Bnssz horizons).
Halic horizon: 30 to 100 cm (12 to 40 in)(Bnss and Bnssz horizons).

ADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL sample S01TX-505-002 in Zapata County, Texas. The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is based on NSSL data for sample S01TX-505-002 in Zapata County, Texas.
