VANDAMINE SERIES

The Vandamine series consists of very deep, well drained soils on backslopes and shoulders of mountains. Vandamine soils are formed in colluvial and residual material derived from argillite with a mantle of volcanic ash. Slopes are 15 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bordengulch, Bearpawmeadow, Marblepoint, and Monumentrock series.  Bordengulch and Bearpawmeadow soils are moderately deep.  Monument rock soils are deep.  Marblepoint soils formed in ash over till and rock fragments are dominated by rounded stones and cobbles.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Vandamine series consists of very deep, well drained soils on backslopes and shoulders of mountains. Vandamine soils are formed in colluvial and residual material derived dominantly from argillite with a mantle of volcanic ash. In some areas, underlying parent material may include rhyolitic tuff. Elevations are 5,400 to 7,200 feet. Slopes are 15 to 90 percent. The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 50 inches. The mean annual temperature is 33 to 41 degrees F. The frost-free period is 20 to 65 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Angelpeak and competing Bordengulch soils. Angelpeak soils have more than 14 inches of ash and are on more concave mid to lower side slope positions of mountains. Bordengulch is 20 to 40 inches to bedrock and on more convex to planar mid to upper side slopes of mountains. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; permeability is moderate. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, watershed, recreation and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is subalpine fir, lodgepole pine, western larch, big huckleberry, grouse huckleberry, prince's pine, white flowered hawkweed, sidebells pyrola, heartleaf arnica, round-leaved violet and Jacobs ladder pine grass. 
Plant Association: ALBA/VAME (subalpine fir/big huckleberry) may include ALBA/VASC/POPU3 (subalpine fir/grouse huckleberry/skunked leaved polemonium)

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Blue Mountains of northeastern Oregon; MLRA 43c. The soils are of small extent.
