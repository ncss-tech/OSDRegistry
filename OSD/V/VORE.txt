VORE SERIES

The Vore series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in silty clay loam
over sand or loamy sand derived from alluvium. Vore soils are on flood plain.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 711 millimeters. Mean annual temperature is about
10 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Aquic Udifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Vore silty clay loam, on a nearly level flood plain, at an elevation of 307.4 meters above sea level.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

 Ap--0 to 18 centimeters;  very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silty clay loam (32 percent clay), grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky and weak fine granular structure; friable; few fine dark concretions (iron oxides); few dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) peds mixed from horizon below; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (15 to 23 centimeters thick)

 C1--18 to 61 centimeters;  stratified dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) silty clay loam (34.9 percent clay); common fine distinct grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) and few fine distinct dark gray (10YR 4/1) and dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) mottles; very weak fine subangular blocky structure in some strata; friable; few dark concretions (iron oxides); firm silty clay loam strata with about 38.5 percent clay at 48 to 61 centimeters inches; few fine sand grains on peds; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (23 to 53 centimeters thick)

 2C2--61 to 152 centimeters; stratified grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) fine sand; few fine distinct dark gray (10YR 4/1) mottles; weak thick platy structure due to stratification; loose; very friable fine sandy loam strata at 61 to 74 centimeters; few fine dark concretions (iron oxides); strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Land Resource Unit (LRU) 107B-Iowa and Missouri Deep Loess Hills; Harrison County, Iowa; about 6 miles west of Missouri Valley; about 400 feet west and 300 feet south of the center of sec. 16, T. 78 N., R. 45 W.; USGS Modale topographic quadrangle; lat. 41 degrees 33 minutes 21 seconds N. and long. 96 degrees 1 minute 34 seconds W., WGS84.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture--the soil moisture control section is moist in some part from November to July
Mean annual soil temperature-- 9 to 13 degrees C
Depth to lithologic discontinuity--38 to 76 centimeters
Thickness of the solum--less than 25 centimeters 
Clay content in the particle-size control section (weighted average): 28 to 35 percent
Note--below depths of 38 to 76 centimeters, typically at about 61 centimeters, the soil is stratified loamy
fine sand or fine sand 

Ap or A horizon:
Hue--10YR or 2.5Y
Value--3
Chroma--1 or 2
Texture--silty clay loam or silty clay
Clay content--28 to 35 percent
Calcium carbonate equivalent--5 to 30 percent
Reaction--slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline
Note: some pedons do not have carbonates in the A horizon

C horizon:
Hue--10YR or 2.5Y
Value--4 to 6
Chroma--2 to 4
Texture--stratified silty clay loam
Clay content--less than 35 percent but strata less than 15 centimeters thick with 35 to 40 percent clay
are in some pedons
Sand content--less than 15 percent
Calcium carbonate equivalent--5 to 30 percent
Reaction--slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline

2C horizon:
Hue--10YR or 2.5Y
Value--4 to 6
Chroma--2 
Texture--stratified fine sand or loamy fine sand; lenses less than 15 centimeters thick of fine sandy
loam, loam, or silt loam are in most pedons; sand size is dominantly fine and medium
Clay content--less than 10 percent
Calcium carbonate equivalent--5 to 30 percent
Reaction--slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--calcareous alluvium
Landform--flood plains of the Missouri River
Slope--0 to 2 percent
Elevation--274 to 335 meters
Mean annual temperature--8 to 12 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation--660 to 813 millimeters
Frost-free period--145 to 175 days
Note: Some Vore soils may be as recent as the 1952 flood or before the large upstream dams were
completed

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the: 
Carr soils are coarser textured in the upper part and are on slightly higher elevations
Grable soils are on slightly higher elevations
Haynie soils are on slightly higher elevations and lack sandy texures below depths of 38 to 76 centimeters
Onawa soils are on lower elevations and lack sandy textures below depths of 38 to 76 centimeters
Percival soils are on lower elevations and have a clayey surface

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--moderately well
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--1.00 to 10.00 micrometers per second in the silty clay loam deposit and 10.00 to 100.00 micrometers per second in the underlying sandy deposit
Permeability--moderate in the silty clay loam deposit and rapid in the underlying sandy deposit
Surface runoff potential--slow
Flooding--rare to frequent for very brief periods during the months of November through July

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cropped to corn and soybeans, but other crops are grown. Land leveling for irrigation is common in places. Native vegetation is mixed grasses and trees but
little influence on the soil can be observed.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
LRU-- Iowa and Missouri Deep Loess Hills (107B) 
LRR--M; on the flood plains of the Missouri River; in western Iowa and possibly adjoining states 
Extent--small 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Harrison County, Iowa, 1971.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters (C1 and 2C2 horizons).
Series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (Ap, C1 and 2C2 horizons.
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 18 centimeters (Ap horizon).
Udic moisture regime.

The colors of materials appear to be inherited from the alluvium. The underlying sand may be water-bearing during some period of the year; however, these soils are not artificially drained. Laboratory data for this site are available from the Iowa State University Soil Survey Laboratory.
