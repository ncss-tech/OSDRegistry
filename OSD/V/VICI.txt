VICI SERIES

The Vici series consists of very deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in sandy eolian deposits derived from sandy alluvium from the Laverne Member, Ogallala Formation of Miocene-Pliocene age.  These soils are on undulating to rolling dunes and sandsheets emplaced over hillslopes of the Southern High Plains, Breaks (MLRA 77E).  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm (21 in), and mean annual temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, thermic Psammentic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Vici sand--on a 2 percent convex slope in improved pasture rangeland at approximately 735 m (2411 ft) elevation.

COMPETING SERIES: 
There are no other series in the same family. Similar soils are the Eda, Derby, Pratt, and Turon series.
Eda and Derby soils: have lamellae in their B horizons, but do not qualify as an argillic horizon, and occur in a more moist climeate.
Pratt and Turon soils: have sandy argillic horizons formed from lamellae and occur in a mesic temp regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent Material: Sandy eolian sediments derived from the Laverne Member of the Ogallala Formation of Miocene-Pliocene age.
Landscape: Dissected high plains
Landform: summit, shoulder, and backslopes of dunes and sandsheets
Slope: 0 to 15 percent
Precipitation Pattern: These soils are intermittently moist in September through November and March through June. July through August and December through February are the driest months. 
Mean annual precipitation: 508 to 660 mm (20 to 26 in)
Thornthwaite annual P-E Index: 32 to 40
Mean annual air temperature: 13.3 to 15.0 degrees C (56 to 59 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 180 to 210 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
These are the Ady, Delwin, Dreyfoos, Lipscomb(T), and Nobscot series.
Ady and Delwin soils: occur on slightly lower positions and have a fine-loamy argillic horizon.
Lipscomb soils: occur on similar positions and have a coarse-loamy argillic horizon
Dreyfoos soils: occur on larger dunes and do not have a diagnostic argillic horizon.
Nobscot soils: occur on adjacent areas with cover sands more than 50 cm (20 in) thick over a coarse-loamy argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage class: somewhat excessively
Permeability class: rapid
Runoff: negligible on 0 to 5 percent slopes, and very low on 5 to 15 percent slopes

USE AND VEGETATION:
Steeper sloping areas are mainly used for rangeland and less sloping areas are sometimes cultivated to wheat, grain sorghum, or hay. 
Native vegetation is predominantly, little bluestem, purple threeawn silver bluestem, side oats grama, sand bluestem, blue grama, and broom snakeweed. Sand Sagebrush is the major woody species along with lesser amounts of Chickasaw sandplum and yucca.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
General area: Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles, northwestern Oklahoma and southwestern Kansas
Land Resource Region: H - Central Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range Region

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Dewey, Ellis, Roger Mills, and Woodward Counties, OK 2018 during the "MLRA 77E - Pratt (Eda) loamy fine sand, 0 to 3 percent slopes" project. The name of the series is from a community in Dewey County, OK. The series name is pronounced using the long "I" for both vowels, as used in pronouncing the words high or sigh (i.e. "Vigh-Sigh").

REMARKS:
These soils were formerly included in the Pratt and Eda series.

Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:
  Particle-size control section: 25 to 59 cm (10 to 23 in) (Bt horizon)
  Ochric epipedon: 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in) (Ap horizon)
