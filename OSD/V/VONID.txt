VONID SERIES

The Vonid series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian deposits.  Vonid soils are on interdunes, ridges, interfluves and hills in the Upper Arkansas Valley Rolling Plains MLRA 69.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 inches (300 mm) and the mean annual air temperature is 52 degrees F (11 degrees C).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Calciargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Vonid loamy sand, one percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 5,263 feet. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(6 to 18 inches thick)

  Bk2--132 to 200 cm (52 to 79 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 1 percent fine distinct masses of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; 3 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

Marjane and Windwhistle soils: have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches (50 to 100 cm).
Palma soils: have soil moisture control section that is dry in May and June. It has hues that are dominantly 5YR.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landscape: plains

Mean annual precipitation: 279 to 356 mm (10 to 14 inches).
Highest moisture period: April through September peaking in July and August.  Driest: December through February.

Mean summer temperature: 20 to 25 degrees C. (68 to 74 degrees F.)  
Frost free period: 130 to 175 days
Elevation ranges from 1220 to 1980 meters (4,000 to 6,500 feet.)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Olney and Valent soils.  Olney soils have a fine-loamy control section and occur on lesser sloping interfluves and footslopes of hills.  Valent soils have a sandy control section, lack an argillic horizon, and occur on the summits and shoulders of dunes, ridges, and hills.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat excessively drained; high hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used as rangeland and nonirrigated cropland. Native vegetation is mainly blue grama, little bluestem, needleandthread, prairie sandreed, sand dropseed, and sideoats grama. It is in the Sandy ecological site.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Colorado; LRR G, MLRA 69. This series is extensive.

The Vonid series replaces Vona in Ustic-Aridic moisture regime.  The Vona series was reclassified from Ustic Haplargids to Aridic Haplustalfs. The name Vonid is coined from Vona.
