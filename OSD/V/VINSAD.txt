VINSAD SERIES

The Vinsad series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in mixed lacustrine materials with a loess cap influenced by volcanic ash. Vinsad soils are on flood plains and lake terraces. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 225 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Aquisalids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Vinsad very fine sandy loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     A--0 to 5 cm; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) very fine sandy loam, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) and light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) moist; moderate very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine interstitial, and few very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (3 to 13 cm thick)

(0 to 90 cm thick)

     Cz2--91 to 107 cm; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) and white (N 8/0) very fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) and pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; very hard, very firm; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular, and common very fine and fine interstitial pores; 3.4 percent salt; noneffervescent and strongly effervescent; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 50 cm thick)

     2Cz--107 to 152 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) and very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and very fine angular blocky structure very hard and soft, firm and friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular, and common fine and very fine interstitial pores; 1.2 percent salt; noneffervescent and strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3).

TYPE LOCATION:  Elko County, Nevada; approximately 1,500 feet west, 1,700 feet north of the SE corner of sec. 8, T.26N., R.54E.; USGS Garcia Flat 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 8 minutes 49 seconds N and longitude 115 degrees 54 minutes 46 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.1469444 latitude, -115.9127778 longitude. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Soil moisture: Usually saturated within 90 cm during the spring in most years. 
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.
Mean summer soil temperature: 16 to 17 degrees C.    
Depth to the lacustrine deposits: 90 to 122 cm.  
Hue: 2.5Y or 10YR. 
Value: 6 through 8 dry and 4 through 8 moist.
Chroma: 0 through 4.  
Salinity (EC): 16 to 32 mmhos/cm.
Sodicity (SAR): 0 to 12.

Particle-size control section: Clay content: 12 to 18 percent.

A horizon 
Structure: moderate or strong, coarse and medium platy or very fine and fine subangular blocky structure.  
Reaction: Neutral through strongly alkaline.

Cz horizons
Texture: Silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam.
Structure: Weak or moderate fine or medium subangular blocky or massive.  
Consistence: Soft or slightly hard with hard or very hard salt masses and nodules. 
Reaction: Neutral through strongly alkaline.
Weakly cemented lenses: Very hard or extremely hard, and firm or very firm.  
Salt: 2 to 4 percent.  

2Cz
Texture: Silty clay loam or silty clay. 
Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.
Salt: 0.1 to 1.5 percent and has a few salt nodules in some pedons.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vinsad soils are on flood plains and lake terraces at elevations of 1,710 to 1,890 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in mixed lacustrine materials with a loess cap influenced by volcanic ash.  The climate is cool, semiarid.  Mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Sader and Dianev soils.  Dianev soils lack salic horizons and have fine-loamy particle-size control sections.  Sader soils have fine-textured natric horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; slow runoff; moderate or moderately slow permeability in upper part and slow permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity in the unconformable lacustrine material.  The water table commonly fluctuates between 76 to 90 cm in the winter and spring to 183 cm in the summer and fall.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing.  The principal vegetation is greasewood, saltgrass, alkali sacaton, and rubber rabbitbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Nevada.  Vinsad soils are inextensive with about 3,500 acres.  MLRA 28B.

REMARKS:  Vinsad soils were formerly classified as Solonchak soils.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the surface to 18 cm (A and part of Cz1 horizon).
