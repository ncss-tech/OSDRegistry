REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 79 to 129 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 196 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 38 centimeters (Ap and A horizons);
albic horizon--the zone from a depth of 38 to 79 centimeters (E1 and E2 horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 79 to 168 centimeters (Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, and Btg4 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

The series was formerly included with the Coppock series. Some pedons have dark sediments over a buried, light-colored soil.

Cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data.
