GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the similar Aransas, Beaumont, Francitas, Galveston, Harris, Ijam, Mustang, Narta, Tracosa and Veston series.
Aransas, Beaumont, and Francitas soils: are slightly higher on the landscape and have slickensides throughout much of their solums.
Galveston and Mustang soils: are on slightly higher landscapes on barrier island, sandy in the control section and have a sodium adsorption ratio greater than 13.
Harris soils: are on similar landscapes, are smectitic, have slickenslides throughout and lack a mollic epipedon.
Ijam soils: are on human-altered landforms and formed from human-transported material (dredgic).
Narta soils: found slightly higher on the landscape, have a natric horizon and, are on flats on the mainland side with ochric epipedons.
Tracosa soils: found on similar landscapes, have a ESP of greater than 20 and lack mollic epipedons.
Veston soils: found slightly higher on the landscape have fine-silty control sections, have irregular decrease in organic matter with depth, and have ochric epipedons.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Special Projects Office

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Brazoria County, Texas, 1978

REMARKS:
Velasco soils were previously considered as a saline phase of the Roebuck series. The high chromas in the lower horizons are related to the red parent materials. The requirements for low chroma are waived on the assumption that the saturated zone is devoid of oxygen and the red colors remain after citrate dithionate extraction.

Typical pedon taxonomic features:
Calcareous: 0 to 200 centimeters
Cambic horizon: 76 to 203 centimeters (Bg horizon)
Mollic epipedon:0 to 76 centimeters (A and Ag horizons).
Peraquic moisture: Low-chroma redox features and reduced horizons immediately below the surface (A, Ag, and Bg horizons)
