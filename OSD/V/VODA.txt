VODA SERIES

The Voda series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on flood plains.  These soils formed in clayey alluvium over loamy sediments in areas of lake beds formerly covered by water.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 58 centimeters (23 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C. (54 degrees F.) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey over loamy, mixed, calcareous, mesic Aeric Fluvaquents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Voda silty clay loam - cultivated.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Ap--0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches); grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable; many fine roots; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (18 to 30 centimeters (7 to 12 inches) thick)

   C1--18 to 61 centimeters (7 to 24 inches); gray (5Y 5/1) silty clay, very dark gray (5Y 3/1) moist; common medium prominent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) mottles; moderate medium platy structure; few thin strata of lighter or darker colors; hard, firm; common fine roots; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (25 to 76 centimeters (10 to 30 inches) thick)

   2C2--61 to 152 centimeters (24 to 60 inches); light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; many fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) mottles; massive; slightly hard, friable; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Trego County, Kansas; about 25 kilometers (15 1/2 miles) south and 5 kilometers (3 1/4 miles) east of WaKeeney; 457 meters (1500 feet) south and 152 meters (500 feet) east of the northwest corner, sec. 1, T. 15 S., R. 23 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Texture 46 to 76 centimeters (18 to 30 inches): clay or silty clay 
Texture lower part: silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam
Mottles: 7.5YR to 5Y hue and higher value and chroma 
Free carbonates: at the surface
Reaction: moderately alkaline
Thin contrasting strata of finer and coarse material are in some pedons.

A horizon:
Hue: 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y
Value: 3 to 5, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: silty clay loam, silty clay, silt loam, or loam

C horizon: 
Hue: 7.5YR to 5Y
Value: 4 to 6, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 1 to 3
Texture: silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam

2C horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR to 5Y
Value: 5 to 7, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam
In some pedons sand or loamy sand are below depths of 40 inches.  
In some pedons a buried horizon is present.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform: nearly level bottom lands
Slope: 0 to 2 percent
Parent material: 2 feet of recently deposited clayey alluvium underlain by loamy alluvium 3 to many feet thick.  
Mean annual precipitation: 46 to 76 centimeters (18 to 30 inches)
Mean annual temperature: 10 to 15 degrees C. (50 to 59 degrees F.)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hord, Inavale, McCook, Munjor, and Roxbury soils.  
These soils do not have a clayey over loamy control section.  
Hord, McCook, and Roxbury soils are on slightly higher topographic positions and do not have mottles in their control section.  
The sandy Inavale soils are on slightly lower topographic positions.  
Munjor soils are on similar topographic positions and are coarse-loamy.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage: somewhat poorly drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: low over high  
Runoff: low

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used for cropland.
Principal crops are wheat and grain sorghum. 
Areas are used for wildlife habitat and feeding grounds.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwest and north central, Kansas.  This series is of small extent, about 8,000 acres.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Trego County, Kansas, 1986.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  
Moisture regime: Aquic
Control section: strongly contrasting particle size classes  
This soil was called Roxbury Varient and mapped in areas above large reservoirs.

Modified format by LRM in 3/2006 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.
