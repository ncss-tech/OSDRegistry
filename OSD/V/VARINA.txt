SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Johnston County, North Carolina; 1965.

REMARKS:  This series includes some of the soils that have been previously classed in the Marlboro series.  It would have been classified in the Red-Yellow Podzolic great soil group.

Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to 14 inches (Ap and E horizons)
Argillic horizon - the zone from 14 to 81 inches (BE, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Btv1, Btv2, and Btv3 horizons)
Plinthite - the zone from 38 to 81 inches (Btv1, Btv2, and Btv3 horizons)
