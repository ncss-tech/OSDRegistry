VINCOM SERIES

The Vincom series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in silty glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on dissected lake plains.  Slopes are 4 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, active, calcareous, frigid Typic Xerorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Vincom silt loam, native rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 5 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate thin platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; few very fine interstitial pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (1 to 7 inches thick)

    Bk--5 to 22 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; few fine masses of lime; strongly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.4); gradual irregular boundary. (5 to 17 inches thick)

    C--22 to 60 inches; white (10YR 8/2) silty clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; 1/4- to 1/2-inch thick varves; strong medium platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; very strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  Lake County, Montana; 1,320 feet north and 2,640 feet west of the SE corner of sec. 30, T. 22 N., R. 21 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil temperature - 43 to 47 degrees F.

Moisture control section - between 4 and 12 inches.

Depth to varves - 6 to 22 inches.

Some pedons have a 2 to 4 inch E/Bw horizon.


A horizon - Value:  6 or 7 dry; 4 or 5 moist

Clay content:  15 to 27 percent

EC:  0 to 2 mmhos/cm

SAR:  0 to 13

Reaction:  pH 7.9 to 8.4

This horizon is calcareous in some pedons.


Bk horizon - Value:  7 or 8 dry; 5 or 6 moist

Chroma:  2 or 3
Texture:  silt loam or silty clay loam

Clay content:  18 to 35 percent

Calcium carbonate equivalent:  2 to 8 percent

EC:  0 to 2 mmhos/cm

SAR:  0 to 20

Reaction:  pH 8.5 to 9.6


C horizon - Value:  7 or 8 dry; 6 or 7 moist

Chroma:  2 or 3

Texture:  silt loam or silty clay loam that consist of varves that are silty clay and very fine sandy loam

Clay content:  18 to 35 percent

EC:  0 to 2 mmhos/cm

SAR:  0 to 20

Reaction:  pH 8.5 to 9.6

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - dissected lake plains and terraces.

Elevation - 2,500 to 3,200 feet.

Slope - 4 to 65 percent.

Parent material - strongly alkaline, silty glaciolacustrine deposits.

Climate - long, cold winters; moist falls and springs; warm, dry summers.

Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 16 inches.

Mean annual temperature - 41 to 45 degrees F.

Frost-free period - 105 to 125 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Vincom soils are mainly used for rangeland and nonirrigated pastureland.  Potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, needleandthread, Sandberg bluegrass, prairie junegrass, and Rocky Mountain juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Vincom soils are moderately extensive in the "Breaks" along the "Old Lake Missoula" sediment and other similar deposits.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lake County, Montana, 1991; proposed in Lake County, Montana, 1982.

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretation Record:  MT0730.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches (A, Bk horizons); a horizon of carbonate accumulation from 5 to 22 inches (Bk horizon); and lake varves from 22 to 60 inches (C horizon).  Vincom soils have a frigid temperature regime and a xeric moisture regime bordering on aridic.
