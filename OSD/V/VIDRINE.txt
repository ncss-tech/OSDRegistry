VIDRINE SERIES

The Vidrine series consists of very deep, moderately well drained to somewhat poorly drained soils. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils, on convex circular mounds or mounded areas that have been smoothed, formed in loamy and clayey sediments of late Pleistocene age. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 19.5 degrees C (67 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1549 mm (61in).

Aldine soils: in a fine-silty over clayey family 
Orcadia soils: do not have aquic conditions in the upper part of the argillic horizon in most years and typically are more acid throughout. 
Messer soils: in a coarse-silty family 
Texla soils: in a fine-silty family 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: loamy fluviomarine deposits of Pleistocene age 
Landscape: coastal plains 
Landform: flats 
Microfeature: mounds (Mounds are 0.3 to 1.5 m [1 to 4 ft high] and about 21.3 m (70 ft) in diameter. In some areas Vidrine soils are on convex side slopes with low relief. ) 
Slope: 0 to 3 percent on mound 
Soil Moisture: Udic soil moisture regime. The soil moisture control section is dry less than 90 days in normal years. The summer months are the driest 
Mean annual soil temperature: 19.9 to 21.7 degrees C (67 to 71 degrees F) 
Mean annual air temperature range: 19.3 to 20.1 degrees C (67 to 69 degrees F) 
Mean annual precipitation range: 1499 to 1651 mm (59 to 65 in) 
Precipitation Pattern: Rainfall is fairly uniform throughout the year. 
Frost-free period: 240 to 300 days 
Elevation: 3 to 21 m (10 to 69 ft) 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Acadia (LA), Crowley (LA), Kinder (LA), Leton (TX), Mamou (LA), and Mowata (LA) series. These soils are slightly lower in intermound areas. 
Acadia and Crowley soils: do not have a glossic horizon. 
Kinder, Leton, and Mamou soils: have a fine-silty particle-size control section. 
Mowata soils: grayer colors throughout. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained to somewhat poorly drained. Permeability is slow. Runoff is medium to very high. A thin perched water table is above the Btg horizon for 2 to 4 months in winter and spring. Grayish colors caused by wetness are within the upper 25 cm (10 in) of the Btg horizon. 

USE AND VEGETATION: In cultivated areas most of the Vidrine soils (mounds) have been smoothed and are cropped to rice, row crops, and pasture. Many areas have encroachment of hardwood and pine trees. Native vegetation was mainly tall prairie grass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwest Louisiana; LRR T; MLRA 152B; The series is of large extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas. 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Evangeline Parish, Louisiana; 1970. 

REMARKS: These soils were previously mapped as mound phases of the Acadia, Crowley, and Wrightsville soils. These soils are reclassified 01/2000 from coarse-silty over clayey, mixed, hyperthermic Glossaquic Hapludalfs to fine, smectitic, hyperthermic Aquic Glossudalfs based on mineralogy of associated soils, pedon descriptions, field notes, and consultation with field staff. Temperature regime changed to thermic 11/2004 based on four year temperature study. Complete characterization and further study of the series is needed. These soils were correlated in southeast Texas until the update of MLRA 152B. The Texla series replaces the Vidrine series in southeast Texas.
 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 41 cm (0 to 16 in) (Ap and E horizons) 
Argillic horizon: 41 to 127 cm (16 to 50 in) (Bt/E, Btg1, and Btg2 horizons) 
Glossic horizon: 41 to 48 cm (16 to 19 in) (Bt/E horizon) 
Aquic conditions in upper part of argillic horizon in most years.
