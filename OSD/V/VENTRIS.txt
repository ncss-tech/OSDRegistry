VENTRIS SERIES

The Ventris series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils with very slow permeability.  They formed in residual material weathered from dolomite, limestone, or calcareous shales.  These soils are on uplands in the Ozark Highland.  Slopes range from 3 to 40 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Very-fine, mixed, active, mesic Albaquic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ventris very cherty silt loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes in woodland. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A1--0 to 5 centimeters (0 to 2 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) cherty silt loam; moderate medium granular structure; friable; many fine roots; 15 percent fragments of chert; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 15 centimeters thick)

     A2--5 to 13 centimeters (2 to 5 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) cherty silt loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine roots; approximately 15 percent fragments of chert; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 13 centimeters thick)

     2Bt1--13 to 41 centimeters (5 to 16 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay; common medium distinct light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) and reddish brown (5YR 4/4) mottles; moderate medium angular blocky structure; very firm; few fine roots; common fine pores; thin continuous clay films on faces of peds and in pores; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (15 to 38 centimeters thick)

     2Bt2--41 to 81 centimeters (16 to 32 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) clay; common medium distinct gray (10YR 6/1) mottles; moderate fine angular blocky structure; very firm; few fine roots; few fine tubular pores; thin continuous clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 15 percent fragments of limestone; common slickensides; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary.  (30 to 46 centimeters thick)

     Cr--81 to 86 centimeters (32 to 34 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) highly fractured weathered dolostone.

     R--86 centimeters (34 inches); hard level bedded dolostone bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES:  Ventris is the only series in this family. Series with common limits in definition are Cadeville, Homa, Invershiel, Marion, Orange, and Wister series.  Cadeville, Invershiel, Orange, and Wister soils have less than 60 percent clay in the control section and are thermic.  Homa soils are similar in texture but are thermic.  Marion soils have less than 60 percent clay in the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ventris soils are on broad gently sloping uplands, side slopes, and on foot slopes of hills and mountains.  Slopes range from 3 to 40 percent.  They formed in residual material weathered from dolomite, limestones, and calcareous shales of the Ozarks Highlands.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Arkana, Captina, Clarksville, Doniphan, Gassville, and Moko series.  Arkana soils have thicker mollic surface layers, dominant B horizon colors of 5YR and on similar landscapes and steeper side slopes.  Captina soils have a fine-silty control section, a fragipan, and are adjacent similar landscapes.  Doniphan soils are deeper than 10 centimeters to bedrock, have redder B horizons, low base saturation in the lower solum and on similar landscapes.  Gassville soils have redder B horizons, low base saturation in the lower solum and mostly on steeper side slopes.  Moko soils are shallow to bedrock, have a loamy-skeletal control section, and on similar landscapes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity class; very slow permeability class.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Some areas are used for pasture and hay. Most areas are in forests of redcedar, blackjack oak, post oak, and elm the native vegetation.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Ozark Highland (MLRA 116A) of Arkansas and Missouri. The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Salina, Kansas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Benton County, Arkansas; 1973.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 13 centimeters (A horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 13 to 81 centimeters (Bt horizons)
Paralithic material--the zone from 81 to 86 centimeters (Cr horizon)
Lithic contact--dolostone at 86 centimeters

The Ventris series would have been classified in the Red-Yellow Podzolic great soil group.  These soils were mapped under the field name of Colbert.  Change in classification based on University of Arkansas Soils Laboratory Data from Baxter County, Benton County, and Lawrence County, Arkansas.
