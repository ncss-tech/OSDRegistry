VICKEL SERIES

The Vickel series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from calcareous shale and sandstone.  Vickel soils are on shale hills and dissected pediments.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Camac series. The Camac series has mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 14 degrees C. and are formed in alluvium derived from quartzite over siltstone and shale residuum.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  These soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from calcareous sandstone and shale over residuum weathered from calcareous shale and interbedded sandstone. 
Landform:  shale hills and dissected pediments
Slopes:  2 to 50 percent
Elevation:  1,219 to 1,951 meters
Mean annual temperature:  7.2 to 11.7 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation:  15 to 23 cm
Precipitation pattern: Wettest months are July to October and driest months are December and June.
Frost-free period:  120 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Casmos, Chipeta, Persayo, Ravola, Sagers and Utaline series. The Casmos soils have a lithic contact with sandstone at less than 50 cm and occur on caps of shale hills and on dissected structural benches under black sagebrush.  The Chipeta and Persayo soils are shallow to weathered bedrock on adjacent hillslopes.  Ravola soils are very deep, stratified, and occur on alluvial flats or terraces downslope of the Vickel soils.  Sagers and Utaline soils are very deep and are on toeslopes of shale hills and fan remnants.
  
DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to very high runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Irrigated and cultivated areas are used for grain, alfalfa hay, and irrigated pasture. Other areas are used for rangeland. Potential vegetation is shadscale, Indian ricegrass, greasewood, galleta, and Gardner's saltbush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern Utah; LRR D, MLRA 34B; moderate extent; about 15,600 hectares (38,700 acres) in Emery County, Utah.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 124 cm.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 25 to 99 cm.  (Bk, BC and Cy horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 12 cm.  (A horizon)
Cambic horizon:  The zone from 12 to 53 cm.  (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)
Paralithic contact:  The contact with weathered shale at 99 cm.  (Cr horizon)
Other features:  Some pedons have salt accumulations below a depth of 56 cm that are up to 8 cm thick.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
