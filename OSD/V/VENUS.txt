VENUS SERIES

The Venus series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy calcareous alluvial sediments. These nearly level to moderately sloping soils occur mainly on stream terraces and footslopes of hills and ridges. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C (66 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is about 864 mm (34 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Udic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Venus loam--in cropland.

Lewisville and Nuvalde soils: have a fine-silty particle-size control section

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: thick beds of unconsolidated calcareous, loamy alluvial sediments of Pleistocene age.
Landscape: hills and dissected plateaus
Landform: Stream terraces and footslopes of hills and ridges. Some areas adjacent to the stream channel may be rarely to occasionally flooded for very brief periods in the spring and fall months
Slope: 0 to 8 percent, but are dominantly 1 to 5 percent
Precipitation Pattern: The majority of the yearly amount occurs during the fall and spring months. The winter and summer months are normally drier.
Mean annual precipitation: 711 to 1,016 mm (28 to 40 in)

Karnes soils: have an ochric epipedon and occur on similar positions 
Lewisville soils: have a fine-silty particle-size control section and occur on similar positions

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderate. Runoff is negligible on slopes less than 1 percent, low on 1 to 5 percent slopes, and medium on 5 to 8 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: Mostly cultivated, mainly to small grains. Original vegetation was tall and mid grass and widely spaced live oak and other hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Areas are in Texas and possibly in Oklahoma. LRR-I and J. Mostly in the MLRA 85-Grand Prairie and MLRA 81C-Edwards Plateau, Eastern part. The series is of large extent.
