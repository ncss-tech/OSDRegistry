VERANO SERIES


The Verano series consists of well drained soils that are very deep to sandstone bedrock.  They formed in colluvium derived from sandstone, shale, and conglomerate. Verano soils are on north-facing backslopes of plateaus. Slopes are 35 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cebolleta, Rionutria, Roy, Shanley, and Storyhill series. Cebolleta and Rionutria soils are moderately deep.  Roy soils have a horizon of carbonate accumulation Shanley soils do not have a paralithic contact within 80 inches.  Storyhill soils have a calcic horizon.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Verano soils are on north-facing backslopes of mesas. They formed in colluvium derived from sandstone, shale, and conglomerate. Slopes are 35 to 65 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,200 to 8,100 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 17 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 120 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Altezita, Esquila, and Estrada soils. Altezita soils are loamy, very shallow to sandstone bedrock, and occur on summits of plateaus. Esquila soils are clayey, shallow to sandstone bedrock, and occur on toeslopes of plateaus. Estrada soils are fine-loamy, have a thicker mollic epipedon, and occur on toeslopes of valley sides.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; very high to high surface runoff; permeability is slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: Verano soils are used for wildlife habitat and livestock grazing. Present vegetation is ponderosa pine, twoneedle pion, Gambel oak, Rocky Mountain juniper, mountain muhly, plains prickly pear, banana yucca, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Verano soils are of small extent on the northern Glorieta Slope part of the Pecos Valley section of the Great Plains physiographic province in northcentral New Mexico. The MLRA is 70A.
