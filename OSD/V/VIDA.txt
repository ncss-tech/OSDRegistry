GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 

Landform - till plains; hills. 

Elevation - 1,600 to 4,000 feet. 

Slope - 0 to 35 percent. 

Parent material - till from mixed sources. 

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers. 

Mean annual precipitation - 12 to 19 inches.  Areas with less than about 15 inches have cooler temperatures and lower evaporation. 

Mean annual air temperature - 38 to 45 degrees F. 

Frost-free period - 90 to 130 days. 

The lower elevation and higher precipitation were added for South Dakota. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.   Runoff is negligible to high depending on slope.  Permeability is moderately slow above the till and slow or moderately slow  below. (Moderately slow permeability is used in South Dakota.) 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Vida soils are used mainly for dryland crops and as rangeland.  Potential native vegetation is mainly needle-and-thread, western wheatgrass, little bluestem, threadleaf sedge, bluebunch wheatgrass and perennial forbs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Vida soils are extensive on the till plains of northern Montana, northwestern North Dakota, and till plains of northeastern South Dakota.
