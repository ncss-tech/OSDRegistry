VILLSPRINGS SERIES

The Villsprings series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains, alluvial fans and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid Typic Endoaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Villsprings silt loam, in hayland (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 4 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; slightly decomposed organic layer; strongly effervescent; clear smooth boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick)

    Ag--4 to 9 inches; olive gray (5Y 4/2) silt loam, gray (5Y 6/1) dry; moderate thin platy structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and common fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; common fine prominent brown (7.5YR 4/4) redox concentrations, moist; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 8 inches thick)

    Bkg1--9 to 19 inches; dark gray (5Y 4/1) silt loam, gray (5Y 6/1) dry; moderate thin platy structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; common medium prominent brown (7.5YR 5/4) redox concentrations, moist; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual smooth boundary. 

    Bkg2--19 to 32 inches; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) loam; gray (5Y 6/1) dry; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; common fine prominent brown (7.5YR 5/4) redox concentrations, moist; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual smooth boundary. (combined thickness of Bkg1, Bkg2 horizons - 10 to 37 inches) 

    2Bkg3--32 to 35 inches; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) very gravelly loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common medium prominent brown (7.5YR 5/4) redox concentrations, moist; 40 percent gravel; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 15 inches thick)

    3C--35 to 60 inches; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) extremely gravelly loamy sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; single grain; loose; slightly sticky and nonplastic; 65 percent gravel; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).
