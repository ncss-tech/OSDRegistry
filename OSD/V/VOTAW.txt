VOTAW SERIES

The Votaw series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils. These soils formed in sandy alluvium on nearly level to very gently sloping terraces of the Pleistocene age. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 1321 mm (52 in).

Tyden soils are loamy throughout and are on lower landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Votaw soils are moderately well drained.  Runoff is negligible.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  These soils are saturated from 64 to 89 cm (25 to 35 in) below the soil surface and have aquic conditions from December to March in most years.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used primarily for woodland and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is longleaf pine, yaupon, andropogons, panicums and paspalums.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeast Texas; LRR-T; MLRA-152B (Western Gulf Coast Flatwoods).  The series is of moderate extent.
