VIRGIL SERIES

The Virgil series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on outwash plains, stream terraces, or till plains. These soils formed in loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy outwash or sandy loam till. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 890 mm (35 inches).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Atterberry, Bethalto, Canoe, Curran, Emery, Franklin, Koszta, Millbrook, Mulvey, and Wauconda series. Atterberry, Bethalto, Canoe, and Koszta series average less than 20 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Curran soils average less than 27 percent clay in the middle part of the series control section. Emery soils do not have a layer in the lower part of the series control section that has more than 25 percent sand. Millbrook, Franklin, and Wauconda soils have horizons with more than 10 percent sand within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Mulvey soils average less than 15 percent clay and greater than 15 percent gravel in the lower part of the series control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Virgil soils are nearly level or gently sloping low broad summits on outwash plains, stream terraces, and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. These soils formed in 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) of loess or other silty sediments and in the underlying loamy outwash or sandy loam till. The dominant clay mineral in the loess is smectite, and in the outwash or till is illite. Summers are hot and winters are cold.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 6.7 to 12.2 degrees C (44 to 54 degrees F).  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 760 to 1070 mm (30 to 42 inches).  Frost-free days range from 120 to 190 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Batavia, Drummer, Elburn, Emery, Harvard, Kendall, Millbrook, Plano, St. Charles, and Thorp soils.  The well drained Batavia soils are on adjacent, slightly higher parts of the landscape. The poorly drained Drummer soils are on lower parts of the landscape and have a mollic epipedon.  Elburn soils have a mollic epipedon and are on similar parts of the landscape nearby but generally are on broad landscape areas farther from the drainageways.  Emery soils are on adjacent dissected till plains and average less than 20 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section.  The well drained Harvard soils are on adjacent, slightly higher parts of the landscape and formed in loess less than 102 cm (40 inches) thick.  Kendall soils are on similar parts of the landscape nearby but generally are adjacent to or nearer the drainageways and do not have a dark colored surface layer.  Millbrook soils are on similar parts of the stream terraces and outwash plains where the loess is thinner. The well drained Plano soils have a mollic epipedon and are on adjacent, slightly higher parts of the landscape. The well drained St. Charles soils are on adjacent, slightly higher parts of the landscape and do not have dark colored surface layer.  The poorly drained Thorp soils have a mollic epipedon and are on lower parts of the landscape.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. An intermittent apparent high water table is at a depth of 31 to 61 cm (1.0 to 2.0 feet) below the surface in most years.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the upper part of the solum and high (14.11 to 42.34 micrometers per second) in the lower part. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of solum and ranges moderate to moderately rapid in the lower part. The potential for surface runoff is low to medium as related to slope.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. Corn, soybeans, small grain, and forages for hay are the principal crops. Native vegetation is mixed grasses and trees. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin. LRR's K and M, MLRA's 95A, 95B, 108A, 108B and 115C.  The series is of moderate extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Kendall County, Illinois, 1941. 

REMARKS: A gravelly substratum phase is recognized. This soil will be investigated during MLRA update activities. Possibly a new series will be developed. 

Diagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon -from a depth of 0 to 33 cm (0 to 13 inches) (Ap and E horizons) 
Albic horizon--from a depth of 18 to 33 cm (7 to 13 inches) (E horizon)
