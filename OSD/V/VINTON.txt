VINTON SERIES

The Vinton series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.   Vinton soils are on flood plains and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, thermic Typic Torrifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Vinton loamy sand-cropland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap--0 to 12 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loamy sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 12 percent fine gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 16 inches thick)

    C1--12 to 24 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) stratified loamy sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 10 percent fine gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 20 inches thick)

    C2--24 to 36 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many fine irregular and few very fine tubular pores; 10 to 15 percent fine gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 20 inches thick)

    C3--36 to 48 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loamy sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine irregular pores; 10 to 15 percent fine gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 18 inches thick)

    C4--48 to 60 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) fine sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; single grained; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine irregular pores; few fine gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Pima County, Arizona; intersection of Continental Road and Highway 89 - in the San Ignacio De La Canoa Land Grant - 75 feet south of Continental Road, 500 feet east of U. S. Highway 89 - in the northwest corner of field; west of Continental, T. 18 S., R. 13 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture:  Usually dry but may be intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July-September and December- February.  Driest during May and June. Typic aridic soil moisture regime.

Rock Fragments:  Usually nongravelly, but may range to 20 percent in any one horizon

Organic Matter:  Less than 1 percent that decreases irregularly with depth

Reaction:  Neutral to moderately alkaline

Stratification:  Usually .5 to 2 inches thick of finer or coarser material. Some strata may range to 5 inches thick

A horizon
Hue:  7.5YR, 10YR
Value:  4 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist
Chroma:  2 through 4, dry or moist

C horizon
Hue:  7.5YR, 10YR
Value:  4 through 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma:  2 through 4, dry or moist
Texture:  loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sand; contains strata of finer or coarser material

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Franconia (AZ), Manet (CA), Villa (CA), and Vineland (T) (CA) series.    Franconia, Manet, and Villa are in the Mohave Desert and Vineland is in the San Joaquin Valley.  All are moist in the soil moisture control section for less than 20 days cumulative between July and September.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vinton soils are on flood plains at elevations of 1,750 to 5,300 feet.  These soils formed in stratified alluvium from mixed sources.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 7 to 12 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 56 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 165 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Anthony, Brazito, and Gila soils.  Anthony and Gila soils are coarse-loamy.  Brazito soils are coarser than loamy fine sand in all parts.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained.  Very low and low runoff.  Moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Vinton soils are used for grazing and irrigated cropland.  The present vegetation is mesquite, catclaw and annual grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern and west central Arizona, southern New Mexico, and west Texas. This soil occurs in LRR-D, MLRAs are 40, 41, and 42. This series is moderately extensive.
