VICKING SERIES

The Vicking series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium and residuum from andesite, dacite, basalt, tuff, sandstone, quartzite and shale. Vicking soils occur on fan remnants, foothills and mountain slopes and have slopes of 1 to 60 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 19 inches (483 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F (4.4 degrees C).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Vicking soils are at elevations of 5,300 to 7,850 feet (1,615 to 2,390 m). They occur on fan remnants, foothills and mountain slopes.  Slope gradients are 1 to 60 percent. These soils formed in residuum, alluvium and colluvium principally from andesite, dacite, basalt, and tuff with minor amounts of sandstone and shale. The climate is subhumid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 25 inches (305 to 635 mm), although ranges of 12 to 16 inches (305 to 406 mm) are most typical. The mean annual temperature is 36 to 44 degrees F (2.2 to 6.7 degrees C). , The freeze-free period ranges from 50 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Acord, Cloud Rim, Hades, Gridge, Isbell and Yeates Hollow soils. Acord and Yeates Hollow soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments and more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Cloud Rim, Hades and Isbell soils lack a horizon of carbonate accumulation. Gridge soils have a lithic contact less than 20 inches (50 cm).

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium or high runoff; slow or moderately slow permeability; moderately low to moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used principally as rangeland for livestock and wildlife. The principal native vegetation is big sagebrush, yellowbrush, bitterbrush, pinyon, juniper, bluebunch wheatgrass, and oak brush. These soils are correlated to Upland ecological sites in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Utah and southern Idaho. This series is of moderate extent. MLRA 13 and 47.
