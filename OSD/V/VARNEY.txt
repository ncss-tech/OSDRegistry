VARNEY SERIES

The Varney series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, slope alluvium or slide deposits.  These soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, stream terraces, strath terraces, escarpments, knolls, hills and landslides.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcidic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Varney clay loam, in cropland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 5 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine and fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 9 inches thick)

    Bt--5 to 16 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common fine tubular pores; continuous, faint clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.3); clear irregular boundary. (5 to 15 inches thick)

    Bk1--16 to 28 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly sandy clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine pores; 15 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; common fine masses of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); gradual smooth boundary.

    Bk2--28 to 48 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) gravelly sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak, coarse, prismatic structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; 15 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; few fine masses of calcium carbonate, and finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 25 inches thick)

    BC--48 to 60 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) stratified gravelly sandy loam and gravelly loamy sand, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; 20 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).
