VILLY SERIES

The Villy series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid Typic Fluvaquents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Villy silty loam, grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--2 inches to 0; root mat consisting of many live fibrous roots; abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 3 inches thick)

    A--0 to 7 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silty clay loam, light gray (10YR 6/2) dry; moderate thin platy structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 7 inches thick)

    C1g--7 to 22 inches; gray (N 5/) silty clay loam, light gray (N 7/) dry; massive; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (13 to 18 inches thick)

    C2g--22 to 34 inches; dark gray (N 4/) silty clay loam, gray (N 6/) dry; massive; hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); gradual smooth boundary. (10 to 15 inches thick)

    2Abg--34 to 40 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silt loam, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick)

    2Cbg--40 to 60 inches; gray (5Y 5/1) silty clay loam, light gray (5Y 7/1) dry; massive; hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - flood plains.

Elevation - 3,500 to 7,000 feet.

Slope - 0 to 2 percent.

Parent material - calcareous alluvium.

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers.

Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 14 inches.

Mean annual temperature - 38 to 45 degrees F.

Frost-free period - 80 to 120 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Villy soils are used mainly as grazing for livestock.  Some areas are drained and used for irrigated crops.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Villy soils are of moderate extent.  They occur in valleys in southwest Montana, Utah, and Wyoming.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Broadwater County, Montana, 1971.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations records:  MT0513, MT0514, MT0710, and MT0910.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches mixed (A, Cg horizons); redoximorphic features from 2 to 60 inches (Cg, 2Abg, 2Cg1, 2Cg2 horizons).  Villy soils have a frigid temperature regime and aquic features.
