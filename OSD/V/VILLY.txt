VILLY SERIES

The Villy series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 310 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid Typic Fluvaquents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Villy silty loam, grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 5 cm; root mat consisting of many live fibrous roots; abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 8 cm thick)

    A--5 to 23 cm; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silty clay loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; moderate thin platy structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 18 cm thick)

    Cg1--23 to 61 cm; gray (N 5/) silty clay loam, light gray (N 7/) dry; massive; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (33 to 46 cm thick)

    Cg2--61 to 91 cm; dark gray (N 4/) silty clay loam, gray (N 6/) dry; massive; hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); gradual smooth boundary. (25 to 38 cm thick)

    2Abg--91 to 106 cm; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silt loam, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 20 cm thick)

    2Cbg--106 to 157 cm; gray (5Y 5/1) silty clay loam, light gray (5Y 7/1) dry; massive; hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).
