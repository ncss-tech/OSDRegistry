VENAGRO SERIES

The Venagro series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in 100 to 150 centimeters of loamy eolian material and in the underlying till. Venagro soils are on nearly level to gently sloping till plains and high terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 610 centimeters (24 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C (41 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Venagro loam, on a west facing, gently sloping terrace, in a cultivated field.  When described the soil was moist throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)
