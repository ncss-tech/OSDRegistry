VORSID SERIES

The Vorsid series consists of very shallow or shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from granodiorite, gneiss, and/or schist.  Vorsid soils are on pediments.  Slopes range from 3 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 331 mm (13 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 2.8 degrees C (37 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy, mixed, superactive Lithic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Vorsid gravelly sandy loam, on a northwest facing, 3 percent slope in grassland at an elevation of 2637 meters (8650 feet).  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  Described on April 9, 1991.

 	A1--0 to 8 cm (0 to 3 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 25 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary.

	A2--8 to 20 cm (3 to 8 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/3) gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 25 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (combined thickness of the A horizons: 18 to 30 cm)

	R--20 to 46 cm (8 to 18 inches); indurated granodiorite.

TYPE LOCATION:  Park County, Colorado; about 16 kilometers (10 miles) southwest of Lake George; located about 300 feet north and 1,000 feet west of the southeast corner of Sec. 24, T. 13 S., R. 73 W.; Spinney Mountain USGS quad; lat. 38 degrees 54 minutes 11 seconds N. and long. 105 degrees 30 minutes 12 seconds W., NAD 27

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture:  The soil moisture control section is usually dry in late spring and early summer, moist in some part in late July and August, and intermittently dry in fall; ustic regime bordering on aridic.
Mean annual soil temperature:  2.8 to 5.0 degrees C (37 to 41 degrees F.)
Mean summer soil temperature:  10.6 to 14.4 degrees C (51 to 58 degrees F.)
Depth to lithic contact:  18 to 51 cm to granodiorite, gneiss,  and/or schist (7 to 20 inches)
Thickness of the mollic epipedon:  18 to 30 cm (7 to 12 inches)
Lithology of rock fragments: granodiorite, gneiss, schist

Particle-size control section (weighted averages):  
  Clay content:  15 to 18 percent
  Rock fragment content:  20 to 30 percent
  Mica content: 20 to 45 percent (estimated)

A horizons
Hue: 2.5Y to 7.5YR 
Value: 4 or 5 dry; 2 or 3 moist 
Chroma: 2 or 3 dry; 2 or 3 moist 
Clay content: 10 to 19 percent
Gravel content: 5 to 35 percent, indurated
Organic matter content: 1.0 to 4.0 percent

Bw horizon, present in some pedons
Hue: 2.5Y to 7.5YR 
Value: 4 or 5 dry; 4 moist 
Chroma: 2 to 4 dry; 2 or 3 moist 
Texture: gravelly sandy loam
Clay content: 10 to 19 percent
Gravel content: 5 to 35 percent, indurated
Reaction: neutral (pH 6.6 to 7.3)
Organic matter content: 0 to .5 percent

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Dickle, Hanagita, Hazton, Heisspitz, Jenkinson, Lotex, Paddy, Skisams, Spliten, Splitro, Tuggle, Udelope series.  Dickle, Hazton, Lotex, and Tuggle soils have a udic moisture regime. Hanagita, Heisspitz, Jenkinson, Paddy, Skisams, Spliten, Splitro, and Udelope series have rock fragments that are not granodiorite or schist. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium derived from granodiorite, gneiss, and/or schist
Landform:  pediments
Slopes:  3 to 20 percent
Elevation:  2621 to 2835 meters (8600 to 9300 feet)
Mean annual temperature:  1.7 to 3.9 degrees C (35 to 39 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation:  305 to 356 mm (12 to 14 inches)
Precipitation pattern:  Monthly precipitation is lowest in winter and greatest in July and August.
Frost-free period:  50 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Martland series.  The Martland soils are moderately deep over schist, gneiss, monzonite, and quartzite.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  well drained, moderately rapid permeability

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation consists mainly of Arizona fescue, Indian ricegrass, blue grama, mountain muhly, needleandthread, western wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Colorado; LRR E, MLRA 48B; small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Park County, Colorado; Teller-Park soil survey area, Colorado; 2010.  The name is coined.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 20 cm.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 0 to 20 cm.  (A1, A2 horizons)
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 20 cm.  (A1, A2 horizons)
Lithic contact:  The contact with granodiorite at 20 cm.  (R layer)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
