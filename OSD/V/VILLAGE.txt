VILLAGE SERIES

The Village series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in 50 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) of loess and the underlying clayey pedisediment or residuum. These soils are on convex ridgetops and side slopes on dissected uplands. Slopes range from 5 to 25 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C (47 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 83 centimeters (33 inches).
