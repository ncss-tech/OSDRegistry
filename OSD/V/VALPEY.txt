VALPEY SERIES

The Valpey series consists of very deep well drained soils formed in volcanic ash over mixed colluvium from basalt, rhyolite and tudd on mountain sideslopes. Slopes range from 5 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy over loamy, glassy over isotic, frigid Alfic Humic Vitrixerands

TYPICAL PEDON: Valpey ashy sandy loam - upland forest, on a 10 percent  convex slope, north aspect, at an elevation of 5760 feet. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

        Oi--0 to 2 inches, slightly decomposed pine litter

        A1--2 to 5 inches, brown (10YR 4/3) ashy sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate thin and medium platy structure; very soft, very friable, non-sticky and non-plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine vesicular pores; 5 percent gravel,  moderately acid (pH 5.8); abrupt smooth boundary.

        A2--5 to 19 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) ashy sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and non-plastic; many very fine, fine and medium, and common coarse roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel, moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizons is 14 to 20 inches.)

        2Bt1--19 to 40 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky stucture; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; common faint clay films bridgingsand grains; 10 percent gravel, 4 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (20 to 30 inches thick)

        2Bt2--40 to 62 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) sandy clay loam; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure, hard, firm, slightly sticky, and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; common faint clay films bridging sand grains; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2)
