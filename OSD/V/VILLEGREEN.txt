VILLEGREEN SERIES

The Villegreen Series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess over sandstone.  These soils are on plains, ridges and interfluves. Slopes range 0 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Calcidic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Villegreen loam, on a southwest convex slope of 1 to 4 percent.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 6 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)

    BA--6 to 9 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate very fine subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 3 inches thick)

    Bt--9 to 15 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) silty clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common continuous clay films on faces of peds; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 13 inches thick)

    Btk--15 to 24 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) silty clay loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4); weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few patchy distinct clay films on faces of peds; violently effervescent; few soft masses of lime; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 10 inches thick)

    2Bk--24 to 32 inches; white (10YR 8/1) channery loam, light gray (10YR 7/1) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 25 percent channery sandstone fragments; violently effervescent; 20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear irregular boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)

    2R--32 inches; hard sandstone, calcareous in seams.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Acantilado, Cahona(CO), Canina, Kucu (CO), and Plughat (CO) series.  Acantilado soils are greater than 60 inches to bedrock and have colors 5YR or redder in the argillic horizon.  Cahona, Canina, and Kucu series: do not have a lithic contact.
Plughat soils: have a lithic contact at dephts of 40 to 60 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform: plains, ridges, interfluves. 
Slopes: range from 0 to 12 percent.  
Parent material: loess and residuum of weathered sandstone.

Mean annual precipitation:  14 to 16 inches; approximately 2/3 of which falls during the months of March through August.  
Mean annual temperature:  50 to 54 degrees F.
Frost free period: 120 to 155 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Baca, Plughat and Wiley soils.  Baca and Wiley soils are greater than 60 inches to a lithic contact.  Plughat soils have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Slow runoff. Permeability is moderate or moderately slow.
