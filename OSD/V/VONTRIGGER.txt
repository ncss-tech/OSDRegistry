GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Vontrigger soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. The soils formed in alluvium derived from granitoid. Elevation ranges from 890 to 1400 meters. The mean annual precipitation is 125 to 175 mm. The mean annual air temperature is about 13 to 17 degrees C. The frost-free period is 210 to 320 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Caruthers, Jumborox and Morongo soils. Caruthers and Jumborox soils are found on similar landforms. Caruthers soils are deep to a petrocalcic horizon and Jumborox soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section. Morongo soils are on nearby fan aprons and are sandy throughout the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: well drained; high runoff; saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low in the upper part and high in the lower part.

USE AND VEGETATION: Vontrigger soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is Cooper's goldenbush, blackbrush, burrobush, creosotebush, Nevada jointfir, big galleta and Mojave yucca.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Basin and Range of California, U.S.A.; MLRA 30. The series is of moderate extent.
