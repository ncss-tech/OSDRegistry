VIBORAS SERIES

The Viboras series consists of moderately deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous, sodic clayey residuum weathered from siltstone and shale. These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on valley floors and valley sides.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 533 mm (21 in).

COMPETING SERIES: The Runn (TX) series is in the same family. Similar soils are the Bayfield (CO), Catarina (TX), Lasalle (TX), and Maverick (TX) series. 
Bayfield soils: are in a mesic soil temperature regime.
Catarina and Lasalle soils: have slickensides and are very deep.  
Maverick soils: have hue of 10YR and yellower and do not have vertic properties.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: calcareous, sodic, clayey residuum weathered from shale and siltstone 
Landform: valley floor and sides
Slope: 0 to 5 percent
Mean annual air temperature: 21 to 23 degrees C (70 to 74 degrees F).
Mean annual precipitation: 406 to 610 mm (16 to 24 in)
Frost-free period: 280 to 360 days
Elevation: 76 to 274 m (250 to 900 ft)
Thornthwaite annual P-E indices: 20 to 32

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Catarina, Jimenez, Maverick, Moglia, Montell, and Quemado soils.
Catarina soils: are in broad nearly level valleys at lower positions
Jimenez and Quemado: soils are gravelly and are on ridges and hilltops of higher positions
Maverick soils: are on higher positions on the more erosive and sloping surfaces 
Montell soils: have intersecting slickensides and are on broad valleys at lower positions

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. Permeability is very slow. Runoff is high on slopes less than 1 percent and very high on 1 to 5 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used primarily for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation in excellent condition is composed of 90 percent grasses, 5 percent woody plants, and 5 percent forbs. In excellent
condition, mid grasses such as twoflower trichloris, Arizona cottontop, plains bristlegrass, pink pappusgrass, and alkali sacaton dominate; mesquite, guayacan, fourwing saltbush, and lotebush are dominant woody plants; the major forb is velvet bundleflower. As retrogression occurs, woody plants increase in density and curlymesquite increases or invades. Other plants that increase or invade the site are Texas varilla, cacti, and screwbean mesquite. The ecological site is Saline Clay 18-25 PZ (R083BY432TX).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Rio Grande Plain, Texas. LRR I, MLRA 83B. The series is of moderate extent.
