COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--Coarse-loamy estuarine deposits 
Landscape--Coastal lagoons in Semiarid coastal plain, Puerto Rico
Landform--submerged mainland beach.
Mean Annual Air Temperature--22 to 31 degrees C (72 to 88 degrees F)
Mean Annual Precipitation--508 to 1,145 millimeters (20 to 63 inches)
Mean Annual Water Temperature--26 to 32 degrees C (79 to 90 degrees F)
Water salinity range--28 to 43 parts per thousand

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Majaguas and Placeres soils.
Majaguas soils--are on lagoon bottoms and have finer soil textures.
Placeres soils--have a loamy-skeletal particle size and occur in distinctly different estuarine tidal stream landforms. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--Subaqueous (permanently submersed)
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--Moderately high to high
Soil moisture regime--Peraquic
Soil is continuously inundated by saline and brackish water

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses--Used for wildlife habitat, recreational boating, fishing, swimming, marinas, mooring fields, and commercial shellfish habitat.  These soils provide improved water quality and flood / storm surge water storage. Dominant Vegetation--Common subaquatic vegetation (SAV) species include Thalassia (Turtle grass), Syringodium (manatee grass), halimeda (watercress algae), and Halofila (paddle grass) 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
General area--Located along coasts and bays of Puerto Rico.
Land Resource Region--Z - Caribbean Region
MLRA--273 - Semiarid Coastal Plains
Extent--Small

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: SPECIAL PROJECTS OFFICE

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Humacao Area, Puerto Rico Eastern Part (PR689); Salinas Municipality, Puerto Rico; 2026. The name is from the commonly found Spanish word for oysters (ostiones) found in Mar Negro area where it was originally recognized.

REMARKS: This subaqueous series is mapped in areas previously published as water in Puerto Rico Soil Survey publications.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon--
Peraquic soil moisture regime--Positive soil water potential (permanently submerged) at the soil surface. (under 50 to 300 centimeters of salt water).
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 21 centimeters (0 to 8 inches).
High n-value--Slightly to very fluid, in layers from 20 to 100 centimeters
