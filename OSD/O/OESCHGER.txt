OESCHGER SERIES

The Oeschger series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from sandstone with minor amounts of siltstone and gravelly conglomerate. Oeschger soils are on mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 110 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1525 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, isomesic Typic Dystrudepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Oeschger loam - on a southwest facing convex slope of 50% under coast redwood, tanoak, Pacific madrone, blueblossom, and Douglas iris at 185 meters elevation. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted. When described on May 13, 2005, the soil was moist throughout.)

 A--0 to 18 centimeters; brown (10YR 4/3) loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and common fine roots throughout; many very fine and common fine irregular pores; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 60 centimeters thick)

 Bt1--18 to 50 centimeters; brown (10YR 4/3) fine sandy loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots throughout; many fine and common very fine irregular pores; common faint brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay films bridging sand grains; 2 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); gradual smooth boundary.

 Bt2--50 to 79 centimeters; brown (10YR 4/3) fine sandy loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots throughout; common fine, very fine, and coarse irregular pores; few faint brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay films on all faces of peds; 15 percent fine distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4) mottles around rock fragments; 5 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.6); gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 20 to 150 centimeters thick)

 C1--79 to 125 centimeters; olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) paragravelly fine sandy loam, pale yellow (2.5Y 7/3) dry; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots throughout; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 15 percent fine distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4) mottles around rock fragments; 20 percent paragravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); gradual wavy boundary.

 C2--125 to 160 centimeters; olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) paragravelly fine sandy loam, pale yellow (2.5Y 7/3) dry; massive; moderately hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots throughout; very few irregular pores, 25 percent paragravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8). (combined thickness of the C horizons is 0 to 100 centimeters thick)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section is not dry in any part for as long as 90 cumulative days in normal years. The soils have a udic soil moisture regime.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Oeschger soils are on mountain slopes and ridges. Slopes are 15 to 110 percent. Elevations are 30 to 640 meters. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from sandstone with minor amounts of siltstone and gravelly conglomerate. The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1140 to 2160 millimeters. Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C, mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C, and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C. Frost free season is about 240 to 300 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Nanningcreek (T), and Scotiabluffs (T), soils. Nanningcreek soils have redoximorphic features between 50 and 100 centimeters of the mineral soil surface.  Scotiabluffs soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Nanningcreek soils are on linear to concave positions on mountain slopes. Scotiabluff soils are on convex positions on ridges and mountain slopes.  

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained, medium to high runoff, moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: 
This soil is used for timber production, wildlife habitat, watershed, and recreation. Natural vegetation includes redwood, Douglas-fir, Sitka spruce, grand fir, tanoak, red alder, Pacific madrone, California hazel, California huckleberry, salal, thimbleberry, red huckleberry, and western swordfern.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coastal Redwood Belt; MLRA 4B. The series is not extensive.
