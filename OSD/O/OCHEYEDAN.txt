MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana; MLRA SSO 10-6 (Atlantic, Iowa)

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Clay County, Iowa, 1973. 

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 36 centimeters (Ap and A horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 36 to 112 centimeters (Bw1, Bw2, Bw3, and 2BC horizons);
udic moisture regime. 

This series concept previously did not recognize soil saturation in the lower third of the series control section. Based on redoximorphic features and field observations, the concept was changed to that of a soil with saturation in the lower part of the pedon in spring.

A lacustrine substratum phase has been correlated in Clay County, Iowa and is of very minor extent. It is on a lake plain. 

In parts of the MLRA this drainage class is called well drained based on the Soil Survey Manual.  Drainage class is a state interpretation. 

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
