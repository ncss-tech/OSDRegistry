OSGOOD SERIES

The Osgood series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian sand.  Osgood soils are on uplands and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 30 centimeters (12 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C. (50 degrees F.) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Arenic Ustic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Osgood sand, rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

  A1--0 to 25 centimeters (0 to 10 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; single grained; soft, loose; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.  (20 to 36 centimeters (8 to 14 inches) thick)

  A2--25 to 56 centimeters (10 to 22 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grained; soft, loose; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (30 to 41 centimeters (12 to 16 inches) thick)

  Bt1--56 to 71 centimeters (22 to 28 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; very few thin clay films on some peds; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 25 centimeters (4 to 10 inches) thick)

  Bt2--71 to 86 centimeters (28 to 34 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocks; hard, firm; very few thin clay films on peds; neutral; clear wavy boundary.  (15 to 25 centimeters (6 to 10 inches) thick)

  Ck--86 to 107 centimeters (34 to 42 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable; visible lime occurs in fine threads and soft masses; calcareous, moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.  (15 to 30 centimeters (6 to 12 inches) thick)

  C--107 to 152 centimeters (42 to 60 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grained; soft, loose; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Weld County, Colorado; 427 meters (1,400 feet) east and 168 meters (550 feet) north of the southwest corner of Sec. 13, T. 4 N., R. 63 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Coarse textured A1 horizon thickness: 53 to 76 centimeters (21 to 30 inches)
Rock fragments of gravel size: 0 to 15 percent by volume, but are typically less than 1 percent

A horizon:
Hue: 2.5Y to l0YR
Value: 5 or 6, 4 or 5 moist,
Chroma: 2 or 3
Reaction: neutral or moderately alkaline

B2t horizon:
Hue: 2.5Y to 7.5YR
Value: 5 or 6, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: usually sandy loam
Clay content: averages 15 to 30 percent
Silt content: 5 to 35 percent 
Sand content: 50 to 80 percent
Reaction: neutral or moderately alkaline

C horizon:
Hue: 2.5Y to 10YR
Reaction: moderately alkaline
Visible secondary calcium carbonate: present in some pedons but its presence is not definitive for the series

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform: concave and very nearly level upland areas that are dominated by deposits of eolian sand
Slope: 0 to 5 percent  
Parent material: eolian material and probably represent two distinct periods of soil formation, although the presence of buried soil horizons is not clearly evident in all profiles
Average annual precipitation: 30 centimeters (12 inches), with peak periods during the spring and early summer
Average annual temperature: 8 to 13 degrees C. (47 to 56 degrees F.)
Mean summer temperature: 19 to 23 degrees C. (66 to 74 degrees F.)
Frost-free season: 140 to 150 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Haxtun and Valent and Vona soils.  
Haxtun soils have a mollic horizon thicker than 51 centimeters (20 inches).  
Osgood soils frequently form a toposequence with the soils of the Valent series which lack an argillic horizon.
Vona soils lack A horizons with texture coarser than loamy fine sand that are thicker than 51 centimeters (20 inches).

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage: well drained
Runoff: low 
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: high to very high

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally as native rangeland.  Principal native vegetation is sand bluestem, sand sage, and bluegrama.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern Colorado.  The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Southern Weld County, Colorado, 1976.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon are:

Soil last updated by the state 7/76.

Modified format by LRM in 7/2006 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.

Updated horizon suffix changing ca to k. Changed B11t and B12t to Bt1 and Bt2. Changed A11 and A12 to A1 and A2.
Updated classification from Arenic Ustollic Haplargids to Arenic Ustic Haplargids.  
Added CEC activity class of superactive based on geographic associated soils.
