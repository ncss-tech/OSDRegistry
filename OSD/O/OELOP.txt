OELOP SERIES

The Oelop series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and eolian material derived from sandstone and shale.  Oelop soils are on stream terraces, mesas, plateaus and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Oelop loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

   A--0 to 3 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; few fine irregular pores; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)

   Bt1--3 to 8 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and medium roots; few fine tubular pores; common moderately thick clay films on faces of peds and in pores; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 9 inches thick)

   Bt2--8 to 16 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few very fine and medium and common fine roots; few fine tubular pores; common moderately thick clay films on faces of peds and in pores; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 15 inches thick)

   Bk1--16 to 34 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few fine irregular pores; slightly effervescent with disseminated calcium carbonate; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 26 inches thick)

   Bk2--34 to 44 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and irregular pores; strongly effervescent; calcium carbonate occurs as few fine irregular filaments; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 30 inches thick)

    Bk3--44 to 64 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine irregular pores; strongly effervescent; calcium carbonate occurs as few fine irregular filaments; moderately alkaline.
