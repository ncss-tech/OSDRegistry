OZAUKEE SERIES

The Ozaukee series consists of moderately well drained soils that are moderately deep or deep to a densic contact with till (Cd). They formed in as much as 46 cm (18 inches) of loess and in the underlying dense till on ground and end moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 950 mm (37.4 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 9.7 degrees C (49.5 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Alexandria, Brushcreek, Lairdsville, Lucas, Morley, Schoharie, and St. Clair series. Alexandria and Morley soils average less than 50 percent silt content in the lower part of the series control section. Brushcreek and Lairdsville soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Lucas soils do not have rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Schoharie and St. Clair soils have more than 35 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on ground and end moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. These soils formed in as much as 46 cm (18inches) of loess and in the underlying dense till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 800 to 1067 mm (31.5 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 6.5 to 11.6 degrees C (43.7 to 52.9 degrees F). The frost free period ranges from about 125 to 195 days. Elevation ranges from 146 to 310 meters (479 to 1017 feet) above sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ashkum, Blount, Hochheim, Kewaunee, Manawa, Mequon, Pewamo, and Theresa soils. The somewhat poorly drained Blount and Mequon soils and the poorly drained Ashkum and Pewamo soils form a drainage sequence with Ozaukee soils. Where the silty clay loam till of the Ozaukee borders on reddish clay drift, the well drained and moderately well drained Kewaunee and somewhat poorly drained Manawa soils occur. The well drained Theresa and Hochheim soils are nearby where the silty clay loam till borders on till with a loam texture. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The potential for surface runoff ranges from medium to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low to moderately high (0.42 to 1.41 micrometer per second). Permeability is slow. These soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 61 to 107 cm (2 to 3.5 feet) for 1 month or more per year in 6 or more out of 10 years. 

USE AND VEGETATION: The less sloping areas are mostly used for cropland. Common crops are corn, soybeans, small grain, and hay. The more sloping areas are mostly used for pastureland and woodland. Native vegetation is mixed hardwood forest. Common trees are northern red oak, American basswood, white ash, and sugar maple. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 95B, 97, 108A, and 110 in northeastern and east-central Illinois, northwestern Indiana, and southeastern Wisconsin. This soil is of moderate extent.

REMARKS: A new typical pedon was added with this update to better reflect the drainage and classification. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
ochric epipedon - 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 inches) (A and E horizons);
argillic horizon - 25 to 97 cm (10 to 38 inches) (Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3, 2Bt4, and 2Bt5 horizons);

densic contact - 97 cm (38 inches) (2Cd horizon). 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to Soil Survey Sample numbers 58WI089001 and 58WI131001 for NSSC-KSSL data on two Ozaukee pedons. Refer to Soil Survey Sample numbers 58WI059003 and 58WI101004 for data sampled as Morley which now correlates to Ozaukee. All four pedons are also in Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 17 on pages 112-115 and 144-147. Also refer to Lab Pedon Numbers 63IL043001, 68IL043001, and 77IL019032 for additional NSSC-KSSL data.
