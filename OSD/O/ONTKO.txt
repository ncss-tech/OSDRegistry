ONTKO SERIES

The Ontko series consists of very deep, very poorly or poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from tuff, diatomite, and volcanic ash.  Ontko soils are on flood plains and in basins.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ontko soils are on flood plains and in basins.  The soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from tuff, diatomite, and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  Elevations range from 4,100 to 4,400 feet.  The climate is characterized by cold moist winters and cool dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches.  The mean winter (December-February) air temperature is about 30 degrees F., the mean summer (June-August) air temperature is about 61 degrees F., and the mean annual air temperature is 42 to 48 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 40 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dilman, Klamath and Yonna soils. Dilman soils are on a slightly higher flood plain position adjacent to Ontko soils.  Klamath soils are on a slightly lower flood plain position than Ontko soils, are fine-silty and lack the aquandic properties.  Yonna soils are on a higher flood plain position than Ontko, are somewhat poorly drained and are loamy over ashy or ashy-pumiceous, aniso.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly or very poorly drained; moderately slow permeability in the upper part over moderately rapid through the Bw horizon, over very rapid in the 2C horizon.  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between the soil surface and 1 foot from March to May.  Flooding occurs in some areas from March to May.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Ontko soils are used for native meadow hay and pasture, irrigated pasture and hay, and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is meadow plants that are dominantly tufted hairgrass, redtop, meadow barley, rush, sedge, and Kentucky bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Pumiceous ash-mantled areas of central and southern Oregon.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRAs 6 and 21.
