OWOSSO SERIES

The Owosso series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy glaciofluvial deposits and the underlying loamy till on till plains and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C (49 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, semiactive, mesic Typic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Owosso sandy loam, on a convex, 4 percent slope in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 2Bt2 [IIB23t]--64 to 74 cm (25 to 29 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots; thin brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; 2 percent gravel; few cobblestones; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. [10 to 25 cm (4 to 10 inches) thick]

 2C1 [IIC1]--74 to 89 cm (29 to 35 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; 3 percent gravel; few cobblestones; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. [0 to38 cm (15 inches) thick]

COMPETING SERIES: These are Chenault, Kalamazoo, Nollville, and Sisson series. Chenault soils have more than 5 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Kalamazoo soils have textures that average more than 52 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Nollville soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Sisson soils have less than 2 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Owosso soils are on till plains and moraines of Wisconsinan age. The slope gradient commonly is 2 to 12 percent but the range is 0 to 25 percent. The Owosso soils formed in loamy glaciofluvial deposits and the underlying loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 940 mm (29 to 37 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.3 to 11.7 degrees C (47 to 53 degrees F). Mean summer temperature is about 21.1 degrees C (70 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The somewhat poorly drained Metamora soils and the poorly drained Corunna soils are in a drainage sequence with Owosso soils. The Kendallville and Metea soils, the moderately well drained Miami soils, the poorly drained Brookston soils, and the somewhat poorly drained Conover soils are associated on moraines. Boyer and Oshtemo soils are on adjoining outwash plains.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Potential for surface runoff is very low to high depending on slope gradient. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the glaciofluvial deposits and moderately high in the till. Permeability is moderately rapid in the sandy loam A and B horizons, and moderately slow in the 2B and 2C horizons.

USE AND VEGETATION: A large part, especially on slopes of less than 12 percent, is under cultivation. Principal crops are corn, small grains, soybeans, and hay. A smaller part is in permanent pasture or forest. Native vegetation is forest, chiefly of oaks, hickory, beech, and maple.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 97, 98, 111B, and 111C in southern Michigan and northern Indiana. This series is of moderate extent.
