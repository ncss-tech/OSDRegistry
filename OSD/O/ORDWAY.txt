ORDWAY SERIES

The Ordway series consists of deep, well drained, slow to moderate permeable soils that formed in moderately thin calcareous gypsiferous and fine to moderately fine textured materials weathered from gypsiferous shales.  These nearly level to moderately sloping soils are on hills, ridges, and upland plains.  Slopes range 0 to 12 percent or more.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON: Ordway clay - grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

  A--0 to 4 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) light clay, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; strong very fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, sticky, plastic; calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)

  B--4 to 16 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) clay, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure that parts to moderate medium subangular blocks; slightly hard, very friable, sticky, plastic; peds are very hard, firm; few thin glossy patches on some faces of peds; calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 27 inches thick)

  Bkz--16 to 35 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) clay, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; massive; very hard, firm, sticky, plastic; visible secondary calcium carbonate and much calcium sulfate occurring as concretions, as crystals, in thin seams and streaks, and in finely divided forms; calcium sulfate content approximately 4 percent; calcium carbonate equivalent approximately 10 percent; calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 33 inches thick)

  2Cr--35 to 50 inches; soft very gypsiferous shale.  Gypsum occurring mostly in large crystals and seams in the parent shales.  Parent shales are sometimes mottled and streaked with reddish brown colors.

TYPE LOCATION: Crowley County, Colorado; approximately .1 mile north and 50 feet west of the southeast corner of Sec. 24, T. 20 S., R. 57 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth to calcic horizon: 7 to 26 inches 
Depth to the paralithic contact: 20 to 40 inches 
Exchangeable sodium: 0 to 15 percent

Particle-size control section (weighted average): 
Clay content: 35 to 60 percent
Silt content: 20 to 55 percent 
Sand content: 0 to 45 percent 
Rock fragments: 0 to about 5 percent 
Size: gravel

A horizon:
Hue: 5Y to 7.5YR 
Value: 5 to 8 dry, 3 to 7 moist 
Chroma: 1 to 4 
Reaction: moderately to strongly alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye) 

B horizon:
Hue: 5Y to 7.5YR 
Value: 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist 
Chroma: 1 to 6 
Reaction: moderately or strongly alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).
Note: Subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur in some pedons. 

C horizon:
Hue: 5Y through 7.5YR 
Gypsum content: 1.5 to about 8 percent 
Calcium carbonate accumulation: 3 to 14 percent

COMPETING SERIES:
Currently there are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent Material: moderately thin calcareous gypsiferous and fine to moderately fine textured materials weathered from gypsiferous shales 
Landform: nearly level to moderately sloping hills, ridges, and upland plains 
Slope: 0 to 12 percent or more
Mean annual temperature: 50 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: about 12 inches 
Precipitation pattern: peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer months 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Gaynor and Pultney soils.
Gaynor soils lack a cambic horizon and contain less than 1.5 percent gypsum by weight.
Pultney soils lack a cambic horizon and have bedrock at depths of less than 20 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage: well drained
Runoff: medium to rapid 
Permeability: moderate to slow 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used as grazing land or irrigated or dry cropland. Native vegetation is blue grama, buffalo grass, snakeweed, and cactus.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Colorado.  Series is of moderate extent.
