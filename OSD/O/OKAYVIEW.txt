OKAYVIEW SERIES

The Okayview series consists of shallow to soft bedrock, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from welded tuff. The Okayview soils are on rock pediments and mountains. Slopes are 4 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy, glassy, mesic, shallow Vitritorrandic Argixerolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Okayview gravelly ashy coarse sandy loam, rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered with approximately 10 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones. Lithology of the fragments is welded tuff. 

 A--0 to 8 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly ashy coarse sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate thick platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine, few fine and medium roots; common very fine, few fine and medium vesicular pores; 15 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles and 2 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.9); abrupt smooth boundary. (8 to 13 cm thick) 

 Bt1--8 to 18 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) ashy sandy clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong coarse subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine, common fine and medium roots; few very fine and fine irregular and tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.9); clear smooth boundary. 

 Bt2--18 to 28 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) ashy coarse sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong coarse subangular blocky structure parting to strong medium subangular blocky; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine, common fine and medium roots; few very fine and fine irregular and tubular pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt1 and Bt2 horizons is 18 to 38 cm.) 

 Crt--28 to 53 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) moderately weathered welded tuff, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; excavation difficulty is moderate; many distinct and few prominent clay films in fracture planes; few fine roots in fracture planes; few very fine irregular and tubular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.5) 

TYPE LOCATION: Lincoln County, Nevada; on the east side of the Fairview Range, about 6 miles south of Pony Springs, 0.5 miles west of State Highway 93, and 30 feet west of an unimproved road; about 200 feet south and 1,700 feet west of the northeast corner section 17, T.4 N., R. 66 E.; USGS Bristol Range NE 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 12 minutes 55 seconds N and longitude 114 degrees 35 minutes 55 seconds W; NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist for short periods in winter and early spring and intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative from July through September due to convection storms; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C. 
Thickness of the mollic epipedon: 25 to 36 cm.
Depth to argillic horizon: 8 to 13 cm.
Thickness of the argillic horizon: 18 to 38 cm.
Depth to weathered bedrock: 25 to 50 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 18 to 27 percent.
Rock fragments: 5 to 15 percent mainly gravel.
Mineralogy: 30 to 50 percent volcanic glass in the 0.02 to 2 mm fraction and averages 0.02 to 0.04 percent Al plus 1/2Fe, extracted by ammonium oxalate. 

A horizon
Value: 4 or 5 dry; 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.
Structure: Granular, platy or subangular blocky. 
Mineralogy: 25 to 30 percent volcanic glass in the 0.02 to 2 mm fraction and averages 0.01 to 0.09 percent Al plus 1/2Fe, extracted by ammonium oxalate.

Bt horizons
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.
Texture: Ashy coarse sandy loam, ashy sandy clay loam and ashy sandy loam.
Clay content: 18 to 27 percent.
Rock fragment content: 5 to 15 percent, some sub-horizons contain up to 20 percent gravel.
Structure: Medium to coarse subangular blocky. 

Crt horizon
Clay films: Few to many, distinct to prominent, coating the surface of bedrock fractures.
Bedrock: Slightly or moderately weathered.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ashcamp and Cormol series. 

The Ashcamp soils contain 12 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are not moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative from July to September due to convection storms. Cormol soils contain 30 to 45 percent paragravel and 0 to 15 percent gravel in the lower part of the argillic horizon and are not moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative from July to September due to convection storms. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Okayview soils are on rock pediments and mountains. These soils formed in residuum derived from welded tuff. Slopes are 4 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,640 to 2,210 meters. The mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cath, Nevu, Ponyspring and Zoda series. Cath soils are on fan remnants and have a mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 14 degrees C and contain a horizon with a firm and brittle matrix. Nevu soils are on fan remnants and are moderately deep to a duripan. Ponyspring soils are on fan remnants and are very deep. Zoda soils are on fan remnants and are moderately deep to a duripan. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; runoff is medium;moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Okayview soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The potential native vegetation includes bluebunch wheatgrass, Indian ricegrass, muttongrass and mountain big sagebrush. This pedon is correlated to Ecological Site R028AY064NV, Shallow Loam 10-14 P.Z. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South central Nevada. Okayview soils are not extensive. MLRA 28A.
