OREJANO SERIES

The Orejano series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from volcanic rock. Orejano soils are on plateaus and have slopes of 4 to 35 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Orejano gravelly sandy loam, 4 to 35 percent slopes - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

       A--0 to 2 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/3) very gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; 55 percent gravel; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 3 inches thick)

       Bt1--2 to 7 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) gravelly clay, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; strong fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; many fine and medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; 25 percent gravel; few faint clay films lining pores and on faces of peds; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.

       Bt2--7 to 12 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) very gravelly sandy clay, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; strong very fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine and medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; 50 percent gravel; few faint clay films lining pores and on faces of peds; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (The combined thickness of the argillic horizon is 8 to 34 inches thick)

       BC--12 to 18 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) very gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine and medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; 50 percent gravel; few faint clay films lining pores and on faces of peds; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick)

       2C1--18 to 28 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) extremely gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; massive; hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine irregular pores; discontinuously weakly cemented; 80 percent gravel; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 12 inches thick)

       2C2--28 to 60 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) very gravelly loamy coarse sand, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; massive; hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine irregular pores; weakly cemented; 55 percent gravel; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.2).  (20 to 35 inches thick)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Orejano soils are on plateaus at elevations of 4,700 to 5,400 feet. They formed in alluvium from volcanic rock. Slopes range from 4 to 35 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches. The mean annual air temperature is about 48 to 57 degrees F. The frost-free period is 135 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cabezon, Thunderbird, Valena and Thimble soils. Cabezon, Valena and Thimble soils are less than 20 inches to bedrock. Thunderbird soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock.  .

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Orejano soils are used mainly for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat and recreation. Vegetation is banana yucca, desert ceanothus, desert needlegrass, flattop buckwheat, singleleaf pinyon and turbinella oak.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Arizona. MLRA 38. These soils are of limited extent.
