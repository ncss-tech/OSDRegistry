OSHONE SERIES

The Oshone series consists of well drained, moderately deep to a duripan soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from welded tuff and volcanic ash.  They are on terraces.  Permeability is very slow.  Slope ranges from 1 to 10 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 360 mm, and the average annual temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Budlewis, Forvic, Hatpeak, Manard, Peevywell and Rastus series.  Budlewis and Manard soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Budlewis, Peevywell, and Rastus soils have an abrupt textural change between the A and B horizon.  Forvic soils have a mollic epipedon that is 50 to 75 cm thick.  Hatpeak and Peevywell soils have a duripan thickness of more than 25 cm.  Manard soils have a duripan that is 3 to 10 cm thick, and have a lithic contact within 100 cm.  In addition, Peevywell soils have a base saturation greater than 75 percent throughout the upper 75 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Oshone soils are on terraces.  The slope ranges from 1 to 10 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium and colluvium from welded tuff and volcanic ash.  Elevations are 1,680 to 1,865 meters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 300 to 410 mm, and the average annual temperature is 5.6 to 7.2 degrees C.  The frost free season is 90 to 105 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Amboat, Aninto, Bancy, Brose, Chayson, Congle, Doodlelink, Forvic, Ruclick, Tock, and Tucker soils.  Amboat and Brose soils occur on summits.  Aninto soils occur on terrace sideslopes.  Amboat and Aninto soils are very deep, and are clayey-skeletal.  Brose soils are shallow to bedrock.  Bancy, Chayson, and Tock soils occur on lower terraces.  Bancy soils are shallow to a hardpan.  Chayson soils are fine-loamy.  Tock soils have 35 to 45 percent clay in the Bt horizon.  Congle and Doodlelink soils occur on sideslopes and breaks, are Pachic, and very deep.  Forvic soils occur on higher terraces, and are Pachic.  Ruclick soils occur on dipslopes, are skeletal, and moderately deep to bedrock.  Tucker soils occur on alluvial terraces, and are somewhat poorly drained.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained, medium runoff; very slow saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Oshone soils are used for rangeland.  Native vegetation is Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, low sagebrush, and mountain big sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Oshone soils are of moderate extent in south central Idaho. MLRA 25.
