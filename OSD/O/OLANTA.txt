OLANTA SERIES

The Olanta series consists of deep, moderately well drained, moderately rapidly permeable, loamy soils that formed in marine sediments.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.
TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Humic Hapludults
       (Colors are for moist soil.)
    Ap--0 to 7 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loamy
sand; weak fine granular structure; very friable; common fine
roots; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (6 to 10 inches
thick)
     E--7 to 11 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loamy
sand; weak fine granular structure; very friable; few fine roots; many fine pores; medium acid; clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 10
inches thick)
     Bt1--11 to 25 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) sandy loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine and medium pores; sand grains coated and bridged with clay; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 15 inches thick)
     Bt2--25 to 34 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) sandy loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; many fine
and medium pores; sand grains coated and bridged with clay; few nodules of plinthite; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to
15 inches thick)
     BC--34 to 42 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loamy sand;
few medium faint pale brown (10YR 6/3) and few medium distinct
strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) mottles; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; very friable; very strongly acid; gradual wavy
boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick)
     C1--42 to 65 inches; mottled yellow (10YR 7/6), light gray
(10YR 7/2), and white (10YR 8/1) sand; few fine distinct strong
brown (7.5YR 5/6) mottles; single grained; loose; very strongly
acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 30 inches thick)
     C2--65 to 75 inches; light gray (10YR 7/1) sand; common
medium faint pale brown (10YR 6/3) mottles; single grained; loose; very strongly acid.
TYPE LOCATION:  Florence County, South Carolina; 1.75 miles
northeast of Lake City, 0.9 mile east of intersection of U. S.  Highway 378 and South Carolina Highway 85, 0.4 mile north of South Carolina Highway 85 on local road, 175 feet west of road.
RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 28 to 45 inches.
The soil ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the A
horizon and is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout the rest of the profile.  Content of silt in the particle size control section is less than 20 percent.
The A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or neutral, value of 2
or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The E horizon has hue of 10YR, value
of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is sand or loamy sand in the A and E horizons.  The Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Some pedons have few to common mottles in
shades of brown and red, and some pedons have grayish mottles in
the lower part.  Texture is sandy loam.  The BC horizon, where present, has colors like the Bt horizon.  It is loamy sand.
The C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or neutral, value of 5 to 8,
and chroma of 1 to 8 with common to many mottles in shades of
brown, yellow, or gray.  It is sand or loamy sand.
COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  Benndale, Dellrose, Dragston, Foreston, Harleston, Harpeth, Humphreys, Johns, Latonia, Rumford, and Sequatchie soils are
similar series in other families.  Benndale and Harleston soils
have sola thicker than 60 inches and Bt horizons with more than 20 percent silt.  Dellroe, Harpeth, and Humphreys soils have Bt
horizons with more than 18 percent clay.  Dellrose, Dragston, and Harpeth soils have mixed mineralogy.  Foreston, Johns, Kalmia, Latonia, and Rumford soils have Ap horizons with color values of 4
or higher, or the A horizon is less than 6 inches thick if its
color value is less than 3.5.  Johns and Stallings soils have gray mottles in the upper Bt horizon.  Porters and Tusquitee soils have mixed mineralogy and mean annual soil temperatures of less than 59 degrees F.  Sequatchie soils have Bt horizons with loam or sandy
loam textures and more than 20 percent silt.
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Olanta soils are on nearly level slopes in
the lower Coastal Plain.  The soils formed in sandy marine
sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual air
temperature is 64 degrees F., the average annual rainfall is 45 inches; and the frost-free growing season is about 219 days.  GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the similar Foreston
and Johns series, plus the Chipley, Kenansville, Lumbee, and
Scranton series.  Chipley, and Scranton soils have a sandy
particle size control section.  Lumbee soils are poorly drained.  Kenansville soils have a sandy A horizon more than 20 inches
thick.
DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Olanta soils are moderately well
drained.  Surface runoff is slow.  Permeability is moderatey
rapid.  Depth to a fluctuating water table ranges from about 30 to
60 inches.
USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of these soils have been cleared
and are used for cotton, corn, and tobacco.
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The lower Coastal Plain of North
Carolina and South Carolina.  The series is of small extent.
