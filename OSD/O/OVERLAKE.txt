OVERLAKE SERIES

The Overlake series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in eolian sand deposited over calcareous, loamy, lacustrine sediments in sandhill interdunes.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 43 centimeters (17 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C. (52 degrees F.)

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy over loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Calciustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Overlake sand on a convex, 1 percent slope, in rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

  A--0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; loose; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (13 to 20 centimeters (5 to 8 inches) thick)

  C--15 to 79 centimeters (6 to 31 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; single grain, loose; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (38 to 81 centimeters (15 to 32 inches) thick)

  2Bk--79 to 114 centimeters (31 to 45 inches); very pale brown (10YR 8/2) very fine sandy loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; 8 percent calcium carbonates; many fine carbonate threads; violent effervescence; strongly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (25 to 51 centimeters (10 to 20 inches) thick)

  2C--114 to 203 centimeters (45 to 80 inches); light gray (10YR 7/2) fine sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; few fine faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) relic iron masses; massive; slightly hard, very friable; 6 percent calcium carbonates; many fine and medium carbonate threads; violent effervescence; strongly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Dundy County, Nebraska. 518 meters (1700 feet) north and 396 meters (1300 feet) east of the southwest corner of Sec. 22, T. 3 N., R. 41 W.  USGS Haigler NW topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees, 12 minutes, 37 seconds North and longitude 101 degrees, 56 minutes, 34 seconds West.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

2C horizon:

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform: sandhill interdunes
Parent materials: eolian sand deposited over calcareous, loamy lacustrine sediments  
Slopes: 0 to 3 percent  
Average annual precipitation: 36 to 46 centimeters (14 to 18 inches)  
Mean annual air temperature: 8 to 12 degrees C. (46 to 54 degrees F.)  
Frost free days: 130 to 175 per year

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dailey, Jayem, Laird, and Valent soils.  
Dailey soils are somewhat excessively drained, are sandy throughout the control section, and are slightly higher on the landscape.  
Jayem soils have coarse-loamy in the series control section and are higher on the landscape.  Laird soils have the loamy, lacustrine material at depths of 5 to 20 inches, and are usually on slightly lower, concave landscape positions. 
Valent soils are excessively drained, sandy throughout the series control section, and are on hummocky dunes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage: well drained  
Runoff: low
Saturated hydraulic conductivity:    rapid over moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of the acreage of this soil is in irrigated cropland.  Corn and alfalfa are the principal crops.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwestern Nebraska and northeastern Colorado.  The series is moderately extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Dundy County, Nebraska, 1995.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon:  
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches) (the A horizon)  
Cambic horizon: 79 to 114 centimeters (31 to 45 inches) (the 2Bk horizon)

Overlake soils were previously mapped with the Dunday, loamy substratum phase, soils in the 1963 soil survey of Dundy County.  The iron masses in these soils are not due to present soil-water conditions.  The seasonal high water table is currently at depths below 10 feet.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  National Soil Survey Laboratory data available for pedon S88NE-057-21 (sampled as Laird).

Modified format by LRM in 10/2005 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.
