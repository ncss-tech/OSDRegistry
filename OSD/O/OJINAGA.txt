OJINAGA SERIES

The Ojinaga series consists of soils that are very shallow and shallow to a petrocalcic horizon. The soils are well drained and moderately rapidly permeable above and below a very slowly permeable petrocalcic horizon. They formed in gravelly pedisediments and occur on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 70 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cheosa (TX), Guvo (AZ), and Hickiwan (AZ) series.  Guvo and Cheosa soils have a lithic contact within 40 inches of the surface. Hickiwan soils have very thick petrocalcic horizons.  Guvo and Hickiwan are in the Typic Aridic soil moisture regime.  Cheosa soils have conglomerate bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ojinaga soils are on fan remnants.  They formed in gravelly pediment alluvium.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  Elevation ranges from 1,800 to 4,000 feet.  The mean annual air temperature is 68 to 72 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 240 to 280 days.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches.  Precipitation falls during afternoon thunderstorms mostly from July to September. The driest months are March and April. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chillon (P TX) and Corazones series. Chillon and Corazones soils occur on lower, younger geomorphic surfaces and do not contain a petrocalcic horizon. Chillon soils contain cambic horizons, whereas Corazones soils contain calcic horizons.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained to excessively drained. Runoff is high on slopes less than 1 percent and very high on slopes greater than 1 percent. Permeability is moderately rapid above and below the very slowly permeable petrocalcic horizon.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used as ephemeral rangeland. Vegetation physiognomy is desert shrubland. Dominant woody plants are creosotebush, mesquite, leatherstem, lechuguilla, and ocotillo. Grasses include chino grama and fluffgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West Texas. MLRA 42. The series is moderately extensive.
