OLIN SERIES

The Olin series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in 60 to 91 centimeters (24 to 36 inches) of loamy sediments and in the underlying glacial till. These soils are on interfluves and side slopes on dissected till plains. Slopes range from 2 to 14 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (48 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 84 centimeters (33 inches).

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Linn County, Iowa, 1970

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters (10 to 39 inches) (A, Bw1, Bw2, and 2Bw3 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (0 to 59 inches) (Ap, A, Bw1, Bw2, 2Bw3, and 2BC1 horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 48 centimeters (0 to 19 inches) (Ap and A horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 48 to 203 centimeters (19 to 80 inches) (Bw1, Bw2, 2Bw3, 2BC1, and 2BC2 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

The difference in saturated hydraulic conductivity tends to move water laterally in wet seasons, and seepy spots are in some areas for short periods.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

The type location was changed from Linn County, Iowa to Black Hawk County, Iowa as the former pedon classified as Pachic Hapludolls.

The majority of pedons observed in the field have mollic epipedons less than 50 centimeters thick.

The MLRA 104 Steering Committee approved property edits to this series in February 2004.
