OBRIEN SERIES

The Obrien series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till. These soils are on hills and escarpments. Slopes are 15 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Obrien clay loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A1--0 to 5 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 8 inches thick)

    A2--5 to 21 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (11 to 25 inches thick)

    Bk1--21 to 37 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine roots; common very fine pores; common fine masses and threads of lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.

    Bk2--37 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine pores; many fine masses and threads of lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Obrien soils are used as rangeland. The potential plant community is bearded wheatgrass, rough fescue, slender wheatgrass, tall needle grasses, other perennial grasses, other perennial forbs, quaking aspen, serviceberry, common chokecherry, and other shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Obrien soils are of small extent in north-central Montana.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Hill County, Montana, 1994; proposed in Hill County, Montana, 1992.

REMARKS: Soil interpretation record: MT1352. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: a mollic epipedon from the surface to 21 inches (A1, A2 horizons); accumulation of carbonates from 21 to 60 inches (Bk1, Bk2 horizons); and a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (A2, Bk1, part of Bk2 horizon). Obrien soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
