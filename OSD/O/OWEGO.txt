Flooding--occasionally to very rarely flooded for brief to extremely brief duration, flooding from streambank overflow is limited where dams and levees have been constructed to protect areas

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are cultivated. The principal crops are corn, small grains, and soybeans. Most areas are drained by surface ditches or land grading. The native vegetation is big bluestem, little bluestem, western wheatgrass, prairie cordgrass, sedges, river bulrush and other species of the tall grass prairie that are tolerant of excessive wetness. See Additional Data section for native vegetative cover in Iowa.
