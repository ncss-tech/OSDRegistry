OXCOREL SERIES

The Oxcorel series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with surficial deposits of loess.  Oxcorel soils are on fan remnants and plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Beeox and Dorper series.

Beeox soils have natric horizons 15 to 38 cm thick and do not have very gravelly horizons within 100 cm of the soil surface.  Dorper soils are 25 to 50 cm to the base of the natric horizon and have mean annual soil temperatures of 12 to 14 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Oxcorel soils occur on fan remnants and plateaus.  They typically occur on summit, shoulder, and backslope positions.  They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with surficial deposits of loess.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1220 to 1980 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 125 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Grassval, Orovada, Ricert, and Zaidy soils.  All of these soils have less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control sections.  In addition, Grassval soils are shallow to an indurated duripan and Zaidy soils are moderately deep to a strongly cemented duripan.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Oxcorel soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly shadscale, bud sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, Sandberg's bluegrass, and small rabbitbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northcentral Nevada.  These soils are extensive with about 200,000 acres of the series mapped to date.  The series concept and main acreage is in MLRA 24, while other acreage occurs in MLRA 28B.
