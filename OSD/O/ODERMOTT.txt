ODERMOTT SERIES

The Odermott series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in sediments primarily from acid igneous sources.  Odermott soils are on dissected high terraces.  Slopes are 3 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey over sandy or sandy-skeletal, smectitic, mesic Typic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Odermott loam - grass.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap--0 to 8 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; upper part may be moderate medium and thick platy; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many very fine pores; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (6 to 14 inches thick)

    Bt1--8 to 20 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/3) light sandy clay, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; weak to moderate medium prismatic and moderate medium angular and subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine roots; common very fine pores; continuous moderately thick clay films on peds; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)

    Bt2--20 to 26 inches; similar to Bt1 except; dark reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moderate to strong medium prismatic and angular blocky structure; continuous thick clay films on peds; abrupt smooth boundary.  (6 to 15 inches thick)

    Bt3--26 to 32 inches; similar to Bt2 except coarse sandy clay loam.  (0 to 8 inches thick)

    2C--32 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) stratified loamy sand and sand, dark brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; massive or single grain; very friable, loose; slightly acid (pH 6.2).

TYPE LOCATION:  Gem County, Idaho; about 3 miles southwest of Ola; 940 feet south and 520 feet west of the northeast corner of section 2, T.9N., R.1E.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the family.  Other similar soils are Brownlee, Denison, Haw, Montour, Tunitas, and Van Dusen series.  The Brownlee series has a moderately fine to medium textured Bt horizon.  Denison and Tunitas series have mottles in the lower part of the profile.  Haw, Montour, and Van Dusen series have calcareous horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Odermott soils are on gently sloping or undulating to steep dissected high terraces at elevations of 2,700 to 4,400 feet.  Slopes are 3 to 60 percent.  Soils formed in old mixed sediments dominated by acid igneous rock sources.  The climate is subhumid continental.  The average frost-free period is 100 to 140 days; and the average annual precipitation is 16 to 23 inches, including 4 to 6 feet of snowfall.  The average annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Appledellia, Brownlee, Gem, Montour, and Van Dusen series.  Appledellia series have a duripan over pebbles at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Gem series have basalt bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, medium to very rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability of the Bt and very rapid for the underlying sands and pebbles.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for range; also for dryland and irrigated grain hay and pasture; one area irrigated apple orchard.  The natural vegetation is bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, bluegrass, related forbs, some antelope bitterbrush and Xericensis big sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern and central Idaho.  The series is inextensive.
