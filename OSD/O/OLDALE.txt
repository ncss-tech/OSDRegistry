OLDALE SERIES

The Oldale series consists of very deep, well-drained soils that formed in eolian material over alluvium from granitoid and/or gneissic rocks. Oldale soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters (4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.5 degrees C (71 degrees F).

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil moisture control section: usually dry, moist in some parts for short
   periods during winter and early spring and for 10 to 20 days cumulative
   between July and September following convection storms. The soils have a
   typic-aridic soil moisture regime.  

Soil temperature: 22 to 25 degrees C (72 to 77 degrees F).
Surface rock fragments: 80 to 95 percent; with 65 to 85 percent gravel, 10 to
   25 percent cobbles and 0 to 5 percent stones. 

Control section 
Clay content: averages 12 to 18 percent. 
Organic matter: 0 to 0.5 percent.
Rock fragments: 40 to 80 percent, dominantly gravel.
Depth to the upper boundary of an argillic horizon from the top of the A
   horizon: 3 to 15 centimeters.

C horizon
   80 to 98 percent rock fragments; with 65 to 85 percent gravel, 10 to 25
percent cobbles and 0 to 5 percent stones.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Clegorpass (CA) and Rockhound (CA) series. Clegorpass soils have gypsum in the surface layer and the argillic horizon. In addition, Clegorpass soils typically have secondary carbonates and silica expressed as coats or films on rock fragments or as discontinuous, weakly to moderately cemented banding within the matrix in horizons below the argillic horizon. Rockhound soils do not receive appreciable summer precipitation, are generally dry throughout the moisture control section for most of the year and have a mean annual soil temperature (MAST) greater than 25 degrees C (77 degrees F).  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Oldale soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. These soils formed in eolian material over alluvium from granitoid and or gneissic rocks. Elevations are 200 to 800 meters (655 to 2,625 feet). The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 millimeters (3 to 5 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 20 to 23 degrees C (68 to 73.5 degrees F). The frost-free season is 300 to 340 days.
GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Carrizo, Goldenbell and Missionsweet soils. Carrizo soils are in washes and on alluvial fans, do not have any diagnostic horizons and have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections. Goldenbell and Missionsweet soils are on similar landforms and have a duripan.  

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well-drained; low runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Oldale soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly sparse creosote bush and burrobush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Mojave Desert of southeastern California. MLRA 30. These soils are of small extent.
