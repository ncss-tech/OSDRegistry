REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 10 inches (Ap and E horizons)
Albaquic feature-- abrupt textural change at 10 inches and low chroma mottles in upper 10 inches of Bt horizon 
Argillic horizon--the zone from 10 to 28 inches (Bt horizons)
Aquic conditions--the soil has redox depletions and concentrations within the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon, with periodic saturation and reduction at some time during the year
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 55 inches
