OLEO SERIES 

The Oleo series consists of very deep, well drained soils on volcanic plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in local alluvium from tephra and loess.  Oleo soils have moderately rapid permeability.  The average annual precipitation is about 45 inches.  Average annual air temperature is about 34 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Culdecole, Hopburn, and Vitroff series. Culdecole soils are deep to a lithic contact and do not have an umbric epipedon. Hopburn soils do not have an umbric epipedon. Vitroff soils have an ustic moisture regime, have horizons containing lamellae and do not have an umbric epipedon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Oleo soils are on volcanic plateaus.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  The soil formed in local alluvium derived from tephra and loess.  Elevations range from 6,800 to 8,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 60 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is 30 to 36 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 0 to 30 days. Frost may occur at anytime throughout the year. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Lasac and Dashiki series.  Lasac soils occur on knolls intermixed with the Oleo soils and on adjacent plateau escarpments.  They are less than 20 inches deep over substratum layers of tephra. Dashiki soils occur on adjacent plateaus.  They have ochric epipedons and are moderately deep over substratum layers of tephra. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to moderate runoff; moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Oleo soils are used for recreation, woodland and wildlife habitat.  These soils commonly support a lodgepole pine/grouse whortleberry community type.  Recent clearcut areas of these soils support communities dominated by elk sedge.  The potential native vegetation is a subalpine fir/grouse whortleberry plant association, grouse whortleberry phase. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho and northwestern Wyoming. The soil is of moderate extent.
