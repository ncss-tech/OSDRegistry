OKABENA SERIES

The Okabena series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in 100 to 150 centimeters of silty lacustrine sediments or loess and in the underlying till. These soils are on nearly level to convex slopes on lake plains or moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 735 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquic Hapludolls

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters; series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon are:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 38 centimeters (Ap and AB horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 38 to 56 centimeters (Bw horizon); calcic horizon--the zone from a depth of 109 to 122 centimeters (Bkg horizon);.
udic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
