OSKA SERIES

The Oska series consists of moderately deep well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from limestone. These soils are on uplands. Slopes range from 1 to 9 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 86 centimeters(and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Vertic Argiudolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Oska silty clay loam, 4 percent slopes in pastureland. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.) 

  Ap--0 to 13 centimeters; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) silty clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots throughout; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary. 

  BA--13 to 28 centimeters; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) silty clay, brown (7.5YR 4/2) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots throughout; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. (15 to 25 centimeters thick) 

  Bt1--28 to 51 centimeters; dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) silty clay, brown (7.5YR 4/4) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; very hard firm, very sticky and very plastic; many very fine and fine roots throughout; common very fine tubular pores; few faint discontinuous dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) clay films on faces of peds; 3 percent subangular mixed gravel; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. 

  Bt2--51 to 79 centimeters; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) silty clay, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) dry; strong medium subangular blocky structure parting to strong fine subangular blocky; very hard firm, very sticky and very plastic; many very fine and fine roots throughout; many very fine tubular pores; many distinct discontinuous dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) clay films throughout and few prominent discontinuous dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) organic coats on faces of peds; common fine rounded black (N 2/0) slightly hard iron-manganese concretions between peds; 3 percent subangular mixed gravel and 3 percent subangular mixed cobbles; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary. 

  Bt3--79 to 97 centimeters; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) silty clay, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) dry; strong medium subangular blocky structure parting to strong fine subangular blocky; very hard firm, very sticky and very plastic; many very fine and fine roots throughout; many very fine tubular pores; many distinct discontinuous dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) clay films throughout and few prominent discontinuous dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) organic coats on faces of peds; common fine rounded black (N 2/0) slightly hard iron-manganese concretions between peds; 3 percent subangular mixed gravel and 3 percent subangular mixed cobbles; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 25 to 81 centimeters thick) 

  R--97 centimeters; Limestone bedrock

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: Residuum derived from limestone and shale.
Landform: nearly level to sloping uplands
Slopes: 1 to 9 percent
Mean annual temperature: 10 to 12 degrees C. (50 to 54 degrees F.)
Mean annual precipitation: 86 to 102 centimeters 
Frost-free period: 170 to 190 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bendena, Martin, Morrill, Pawnee, Polo, and Vinland series.
The Bendena, Martin, and Vinland soils are on slopes below Oska soils.
The Martin, Morrill, and Pawnee soils are greater than 102 centimeters  to lithic contact.
Pawnee and Polo soils are on higher landscapes than Oska soils. Bendena, and Vinland soils have bedrock at depths less than 51 centimeters.
Morrill soils are on similar landscapes as Oska soils. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage: Well drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: moderately low 

USE AND VEGETATION: About half of the acreage is cultivated.
Sorghum, soybeans, wheat, and alfalfa are the principal crops.
The remainder is range or pasture. 
Native vegetation is tall and midgrasses. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern Kansas, Northwestern Missouri; MLRA 106; moderate extent.

Pedon used is 94KS045004. Lab data was run at the National Soil Survey Laboratory in Lincoln, Nebraska. Lab samples were 94P6360-6364. 
Modified format by LRM in 7/2006 

09/2008 GJJ added some metric conversions, and removed English units.

11/2008 JCR Increased clay range of Bt from 50 to 60 percent based on soil characterization data.
