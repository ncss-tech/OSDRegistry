OCHILTREE SERIES

The Ochiltree series consists of very shallow, somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapid permeable soils that formed in loamy calcareous caliche colluvium from the Ash Hollow or Kimball Members, Ogallala Formation of Miocene-Pliocene age.  These soils are on gently sloping to steep hillslopes in the Southern High Plains, Breaks (MLRA 77E).  The slope ranges from 5 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm (21 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).

(Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

SERIES PROPOSED:  Beaver County, OK 2009.  The name of the series comes from Ochiltree County, Texas.     

REMARKS: 
The Ochiltree series was formerly included in the Potter series.  The series was separated based on the features of a petrocalcic horizon, mineralogy, and moisture regime.

Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon:  0 to 21 cm (0 to 8 in) (Ak horizon)
Petrocalcic horizon:  21 to 49 cm (8 to 19 in) (Bkkm horizon)
Calcic Horizon:  49 to 180 cm (19 to 71 in) (Bk, and BCk horizons)
Secondary carbonates: 0 to 180 cm (0 to 71 in) (all horizons)
Particle Size Control Section:  0 to 21 cm (0 to 8 in)
