OWLSHEAD SERIES

The Owlshead series consists of very shallow and shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. The Owlshead soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 66 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Puelzmine (T NV) and Ustidur (T NV) series. Puelzmine is deeper to a duripan and the duripan overlies bedrock. Ustidur soils have a moisture regime bordering on ustic. Similar soils in a Typic subgroup include the Crosgrain (T NV), Greyeagle (CA), Longjim (NV), and Tumarion (T AZ) series. These soils all have an indurated duripan.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Owlshead soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. These soils formed in mixed alluvium. Elevations are 1,950 to 3,500 feet. The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 2 to 7 inches; mean annual air temperature is 61 to 70 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 240 to 340 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arizo, Crackerjack (T), and Tenwell soils. Arizo soils do not have a duripan, have a sandy-skeletal particle-size control section and are found in inset fans and alluvial fans. Crackerjack soils are on ballenas and similar fan remnants and have a loamy particle-size control section. Tenwell soils are on remnants on lower slopes of ballenas and have fine-loamy particle-size control sections and a duripan below 20 inches. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very high to medium runoff; moderately rapid permeability above the duripan.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Owlshead soils are used for military exercises and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly shadscale, creosotebush and white bursage.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mojave Desert of southeastern California. MLRA 30. These soils are of small extent.
