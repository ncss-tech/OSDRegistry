OVANDO SERIES

The Ovando series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from granite.  These soils are on mountains. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed Lamellic Cryorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ovando gravelly sandy loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; undecomposed and slightly decomposed forest litter.

    E1--2 to 8 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate very fine and fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; common very fine and fine pores; 20 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary.

    E2--8 to 27 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly loamy coarse sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; common very fine and fine pores; 40 percent pebbles; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of E horizons is 10 to 21 inches)

    E and Bt--27 to 51 inches; E part (80 percent) is very pale brown (10YR 7/4) very gravelly loamy coarse sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; B part (20 percent) is brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam lamellae 1/8 to 1/2 inch thick, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; texture mixed is very gravelly loamy coarse sand; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; 5 percent cobbles, 45 percent pebbles; moderately acid (pH 5.8); gradual smooth boundary. (10 to 26 inches thick)

    C--51 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 20 percent cobbles, 55 percent pebbles; moderately acid (pH 5.8).

COMPETING SERIES:

Comad (MT) - has an ustic moisture regime; mainly extremely stony throughout the soil.

Nanita (CO) - has an ustic moisture regime.

Rusbach (NM) - has Bw horizons; dry in the moisture control section during June; formed in colluvium from tuff; the main cobble rock fragment is tuff; at elevations in excess of 8,600 feet.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - mountains.
Elevation - 4,500 to 7,500 feet.
Slope - 2 to 60 percent.
Parent material - colluvium derived from granite.
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs.
Mean annual precipitation -  22 to 35 inches, much of which falls as snow and as spring rain.
Mean annual temperature - 35 to 42 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 30 to 70 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Excessively drained; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Ovando soils are used for timber production, watersheds, and as wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is mainly subalpine fir, western larch, Douglas fir, and lodgepole pine with an understory of twinflower, common beargrass, and grouse whortleberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Ovando soils are of small extent in western Montana.
