OTERODRY SERIES

The Oterodry series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian deposits and/or alluvium on hillslopes and paleoterraces in MLRA 69.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches  (330 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F. (11 degrees C.).

Ustic Aridic moisture regime

The Otero series was  reclassified as a Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Aridic Ustorthents 3/94.  Oterodry replaces the Otero series in the ustic-aridic moisture regime in MLRA 69.

LAN/LLC/WAW 7/2012  Based on field experience and re-examination of available data the type location for Oterodry is being moved and the series reclassified as Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Haplocambid.  The range in characteristics and properties are based on field experience.  Competing series were updated to reflect the new classification.
