GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ride, Rocklake, Saintelias, Stibnite, Taral, and Townlake soils. 
Ride soils are somewhat excessively drained, lack permafrost or a mollic epipedon, and occur on mountain slopes and hillslopes.
Rocklake soils are shallow to bedrock, lack permafrost, and occur on ridge lines and escarpments.
Saintelias soils are poorly drained, have a histic epipedon, form over lacustrine sediments, and occur on terraces and in river valleys atop 
Stibnite soils are well drained, lack permafrost, have a cambic horizon, and occur in till plains, mountains, kames and kettles.
Taral soils are well drained, lack permafrost, have a deep (>40 cm, 16 in thick) mollic epipedon, and occur on mountain and hill slopes greater than 25 percent.
Townlake soils have a folistic epipedon, a cryoturbated horizon, and occurs on hills, mountain slopes, and river valleys.

Drainage class: moderately well drained
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: very high in the Oi and C horizon, high in the A/O and A horizons, low in the A/Cf horizon.
Permeability: very rapid in the Oi and C horizon, moderately rapid in the A/O and A horizons, very slow in the A/Cf horizon.
Runoff: high

USE AND VEGETATION:
