COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this classification.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landforms: swales on mountains
Parent material: silty eolian deposits over gravelly till
Elevation: 2,365 to 3,773 feet (721 to 1,150 m)
Slope: 8 to 45 percent
Annual precipitation: 23 to 37 inches (596 to 940 mm)
Annual temperature: 25 degrees F (-4 degrees C)
Frost-free period: 50 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Frostcircle and Waitabit soils. Frostcircle soils are poorly drained, shallow or very shallow to permafrost, and occur on mountains. Waitabit soils are well drained, very deep, and occur on mountains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained, very high runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat and recreation. Native vegetation is small.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 228, Interior Alaska Mountains, Alaska. The series is of small extent.
