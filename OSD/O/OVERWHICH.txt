OVERWHICH SERIES

The Overwhich series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium or outwash. These soils are on stream terraces, outwash fans, and flood plains. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm. Mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Oxyaquic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Overwhich loam, in rangeland on a 1 percent slope at 1,047 meters elevation (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 28 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and common fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular and tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); slightly effervescent; clear smooth boundary. (25 to 36 cm thick)

    Bw--28 to 43 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular and tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); slightly effervescent; gradual smooth boundary. (15 to 48 cm thick)

    C1--43 to 71 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; 5 percent medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) redox concentrations; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual wavy boundary.

    C2--71 to 84 cm; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) fine sandy loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; 10 percent medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redox concentrations; 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary. (combined thickness of C horizons 18 to 58 to cm thick)

    2C3--84 to 152 cm; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) very gravelly loamy sand, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; 5 percent medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redox concentrations; 50 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4).
