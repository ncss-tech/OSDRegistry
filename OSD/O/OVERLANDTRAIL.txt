OVERLANDTRAIL SERIES

The Overlandtrail series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and/or slope alluvium derived from igneous and metamorphic rock over sedimentary rock. These soils are on hillslopes and eroded fan remnants. Slopes are 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 3.3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Overlandtrail very gravelly sandy loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 7 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4), moist; weak fine granular structure; friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots throughout; many fine interstitial pores; 50 percent gravel; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 10 cm thick)                                                                                

    Btky--7 to 34 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; firm, moderately hard, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots throughout; many fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; 5 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 10 percent irregular carbonate masses in matrix; 5 percent irregular gypsum masses in matrix; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.

(25 to 75 cm thick)                                                              

    2BCky--90 to 150 cm; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) very gravelly fine sandy loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3), moist; massive; friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few fine roots throughout; many fine tubular pores; 40 percent gravel; 5 percent irregular carbonate coats on rock fragments; 10 percent irregular gypsum crystal clusters in matrix; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1).
