ADDITIONAL DATA: These soils were previously mapped as Wymore eroded and severely eroded. These soils are assumed to have originally classified as Aquertic Argiudolls. However because of erosion these soils no longer have a mollic epipedon. In addition the part of the soil containing the most clay is now at or near the surface.  These soils are wet close enough to the surface for long enough periods that planting or harvesting operations are adversely affected during prolonged wet periods. 

This is a new series to replace Wymore eroded and Wymore severely eroded.
