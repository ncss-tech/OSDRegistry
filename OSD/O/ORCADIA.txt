COMPETING SERIES:  There are no series in the same family.  Similar soils are Acadia, Anahuac, Aldine, Gist, Vidrine, and Texla.

Acadia soils: do not have a glossic horizon.
Anahuac and Vidrine: are in a fine family
Aldine soils: have a fine-silty over clayey particle-size control section.
Gist soils: have a coarse-silty particle-size control section.
Texla soils: have a fine-silty particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loamy fluviomarine deposits derived from the Beaumont Formation of Pleistocene age
Landscape: flat coastal plains
Landform: flats
Microfeature: relict point bars and natural levees
Slope: 0 to 2 percent
Mean annual precipitation range: 1219 to 1575 mm (48 to 62 in)
Precipitation Pattern: Rainfall is fairly uniform throughout the year with slight peaks in the fall and spring months.
Mean annual air temperature range: 20.0 to 22.2 degrees C (68 to 72 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 270 to 300 days
Elevation: 3 to 30.5 m (10 to 100 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aris, Anahuac, Levac, Meaton, Morey, Mocarey, and the Spindletop series.

Aris soils: are gray throughout due to wetness; are on flats
Anahuac and Orcadia soils: are on a broader landform
Levac soils: somewhat poorly drained; are truncated pimple mounds
Mocarey soils: in a fine-loamy family similar landform
Meaton and Morey soils: in a fine-silty family; similar landform
Spindletop soils: are in a fine family; are on pimple mounds

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  Permeability is very slow.  Runoff is very high unless the glossic horizon has a saturated hydraulic conductivity of 0.6 or greater that extends below a depth of 50 cm (20 in); in which case, the runoff is high.  The soil is rarely flooded for very brief to brief periods. Flooding occurs as a result of storm surge during tropical storms which occurs in areas less than 4.6 m (15 ft) elevation. These soils have episaturation from 20 to 100 cm (8 to 40 in) below the soil surface from January to March and endosaturation from 122 to 203 cm (48 to 80 in) below the surface during the same period.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for pasture and rangeland.  Some areas are used for woodland where pine and hardwoods have encroached.  Pastures are bahiagrass or bermudagrass.  Native vegetation is tall prairie grasses, mainly andropogons, panicum, and paspalums.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeast Texas and possibly Louisiana; Land Resource Region T; MLRA 150A Gulf Coast Prairies; the series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Orange County, Texas; 1996.

REMARKS: The Orcadia soils were formerly included with the Acadia and Aldine series. The classification was changed during the update of MLRA 150A to reflect lab data at the type location.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in) (A and E horizons).

Albic horizon: 13 to 25 cm (5 to 10 in) (E horizon).

Glossic horizon: 25 to 38 cm (10 to 15 in) (Bt/E horizon).

Argillic horizon:  25 to 203 cm (10 to 80 in) (Bt/E, Bt1, Bt2,Btg1, Btg2, Btg3 horizons).

Oxyaquic feature: They are saturated in the subsurface layer for 30 or more days in normal years.

Additional comments: At the series type location the Bt/E horizon has 12.8 percent clay and the Bt1 has 48.3 percent clay.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  TAMU data (S94TX-361-001) from type location in Orange County.
