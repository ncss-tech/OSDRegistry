MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Polk County, Texas, 1983.

REMARKS:  These soils have been included in the Segno and Malbis series.  The Otanya series was proposed in Jasper County, Texas 1977 and was dropped in 1980.  It was redefined slightly and proposed for active status in 1982.  The type location was moved from Polk County to Tyler County, which is centrally located in the series province.  The classification was changed from Plinthic Paleudults to Typic Paleudults during the correlation of the update of MLRA 152B in June 2004 after pit studies showed that less than 5 percent plinthite is common in most pedons.  The water table depths and time period were established as a result of a water table study conducted in Jasper County, Texas and Beauregard Parish, Louisiana from 1998 to 2002.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section: 48 to 98 cm (19 to 39 in).  (Bt and Btc1 horizons) 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 48 cm (0 to 19 in).  (A, E1 and E2 horizons) 
Argillic horizon: 48 to 203 cm (19 to 80 in) Bt, Btc1

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data number S98TX-457-001 from Tyler County, Texas.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Data from the Texas A&M University Soil Characterization laboratory exists from the series type location in Tyler County (S98TX-457-001) and from a representative pedon in Jasper County, Texas (S98TX-241-001).  The data from Jasper County has a base saturation at 180 cm below the mineral surface of 52, which is out of range for the Ultisols order.
