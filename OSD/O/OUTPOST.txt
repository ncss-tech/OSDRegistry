OUTPOST SERIES

The Outpost series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Outpost soils are on floodplains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competitors.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Outpost soils are on floodplains.  They formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,000 to 6,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 8 inches with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain or run-on moisture following prolonged, high-intensity, convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 52 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Aneth, Mack, Redlands, and Sogzie soils.  Aneth soils are sandy, contain buried loamy horizons, and occur on adjacent eolian-mantled surfaces.  Mack soils are fine-loamy, have argillic and calcic horizons, and occur on high stream terraces.  Redlands soils are fine-loamy, have argillic horizons, and occur on fan terraces.  Sogzie soils are coarse-loamy, have argillic and calcic horizons, and occur on mesas and undulating plateaus.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; slow permeability in the upper part and moderate permeability in the lower part.  These soils are subject to occasional, very brief periods of flooding between July and September.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing.  Present vegetation is alkali sacaton, galleta, fourwing saltbush, black greasewood, and Russian thistle.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Outpost soils are of small extent on the Blanding Basin and Tyende Saddle portions of the Colorado Plateau province in northeast Arizona.  MLRA 35.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 3 inches (A horizon)

Entisol feature - The lack of a diagnostic epipedon or diagnostic subsurface horizons

Major lithologic discontinuity - The abrupt change to loamy material at about 35 inches (2C1, 2C2, and 2C3 horizons)

A strongly contrasting particle-size class within a depth of 40 inches

Vertic properties - The presence of cracks wider than 5 mm and slickensides in a layer more than 30 cm thick which is within 125 cm of the soil surface (C2, Cyss1, Cyss2 horizons)

Keys to Soil Taxonomy - Soils classified according to the Eighth Edition, 1998.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Salinity values determined with an Instant EC salinity kit.  Sodicity values determined for three horizons by Inter-Mountain Laboratories, Inc.
