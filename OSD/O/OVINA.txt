OVINA SERIES

The Ovina series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy and sandy eolian and alluvial material on flood plains and terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 56 centimeters (22 inches), and the mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C. (50 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Fluvaquentic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ovina loamy fine sand - on a 1 percent convex northwest facing slope in a native grass hay meadow.  When described the soil was wet below a depth of 20 inches.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

   A1--0 to 20 centimeters (0 to 8 inches); very dark gray (10YR 3/1) loamy fine sand, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak fine granular structure parting to weak very fine granular; soft, very friable; violent effervescence; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (18 to 25 centimeters (7 to 10 inches) thick)

   A2--20 to 28 centimeters (8 to 11 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loamy fine sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 25 centimeters (3 to 10 inches) thick)

   C1--28 to 66 centimeters (11 to 26 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; a few fine distinct reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; iron masses in the matrix in the lower part; weak coarse subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine subangular blocky; soft, very friable; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.  (15 to 51 centimeters (6 to 20 inches) thick)

   C2--66 to 76 centimeters (26 to 30 inches); gray (10YR 5/1) fine sandy loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; a few fine distinct reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; iron masses in the matrix; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 51 centimeters (0 to 20 inches) thick)

   C3--76 to 102 centimeters (30 to 40 inches); light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) loam; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; a few fine distinct dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist, iron masses in the matrix; massive; slightly hard, friable; strong effervescence; slightly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.  (15 to 51 (6 to 20 inches) thick)

   C4--102 to 203 centimeters (40 to 80 inches); light gray (2.5Y 7/2) fine sandy loam, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) moist; a few fine distinct dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist, iron masses in the matrix; massive; soft, very friable; strong effervescence; slightly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Howard County, Nebraska; about 5.6 kilometers (3.5 miles) east of Dannebrog; 335 meters (1100 feet) south and 244 meters (800 feet) east of the northwest corner, sec. 9, T. 13 N., R. 10 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Thickness of the solum: 25 to 51 centimeters (10 to 20 inches)  
Mollic epipedon: 18 to 49 centimeters (7 to 19 inches) 
Free carbonates: generally in the solum

A horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 3 to 5, and 2 or 3 moist 
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loam or fine sand
Reaction: neutral to moderately alkaline.

C horizon
Hue: 10YR in the upper part and 2.5Y in the lower part
Value: 5 to 7, and 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: fine sandy loam or loam, Thin strata of loamy fine sand through silty clay loam 3 to 8 centimeters (1 to 3 inches) thick are present in the C horizon.  
Reaction: slightly or moderately alkaline
Redoximorphic Features: few to many distinct iron masses in the matrix with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 to 6

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Marksbutte, Sunset, and Wann series.
Marksbutte soils have coarse sand or gravelly sand at depths of 71 centimeters (28 inches) or greater.  
Sunset soils are in a drier climate.  
Wann soils contain more sand in the lower part of the C horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: loamy and sandy eolian and alluvial material
Landform wet sandhill valleys, terraces or flood plains 
Landscape: a plane or convex surface
Slope: 0 to 6 percent
Mean annual temperature: 8 to 12 degrees C. (47 to 53 degrees F.)
Mean annual precipitation: 46 to 66 centimeters (18 to 26 inches)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alda, Dunday, Els, Elsmere, Libory, Loretto, Loup, Ortello, Thurman, Valentine and Wann soils.  
Alda and Wann occur in lower positions on the landscape.  
Boel and Elsmere soils have sandy textures and are on similar landscapes.  Boelus, Cass, Dunday, Libory, Loretto, Ortello, Thurman and Valentine soils are better drained and all except Cass are on higher elevations.  
Cass soils are on flood plains.  
Els soils have lighter colored surface horizons and are on similar landscapes.
Loup soils have a seasonal high water table at the surface to a depth of 1.5 feet, are in a sandy family, and are on lower landscapes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage: somewhat poorly drained  
Runoff: low or moderately low
Saturated hydraulic conductivity:  is moderate.  
Seasonal high water table: fluctuates 30 to 91 centimeters (1 to 3 feet) in the spring and drops below 122 centimeters (4 feet) in late summer In spring the Perched water table: perched above the finer textured material in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are in native grass.  
Native vegetation is big and little bluestem, switchgrass, indiangrass, sedges, and small amounts of prairie cordgrass.  
Corn and alfalfa are the principal crops on the cultivated areas.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central and western Nebraska.  The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Hall County, Nebraska, 1959.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 28 centimeters (11 inches) (A1 and A2 horizons).  Redoximorphic features were at a depth of 28 to 152 centimeters (11 to 60 inches).

This soil was mapped in the Ortello series as an imperfectly drained or loamy substratum phase.  

Modified format by LRM in 10/2005 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.
