OLMITZ SERIES

The Olmitz series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy local alluvium derived from till of mixed mineralogical composition.  These soils are on alluvial fans at or near the mouth of upland drainageways and on slightly concave to linear base slopes.  Slope ranges from 2 to 14 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 850 millimeters.

USE AND VEGETATION:
Areas adjacent to wide valleys or less sloping uplands are cultivated.  Principal crops are corn, soybeans, small grains, and alfalfa. Areas associated with steeply sloping uplands are pastured.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Lucas County, Iowa, 1940

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters (A2, A3, and Bw1 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (Ap, A1, A2, A3, Bw1, Bw2, and BC horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 76 centimeters (Ap, A1, A2, and A3 horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 76 to 152 centimeters (Bw1, Bw2, and BC horizons);
udic moisture regime.

The loamy sediments are 1.8 to 2 meters thick in most areas but depth to clay loam till is as shallow as 100 centimeters in some pedons.

Cation-exchange class is inferred from lab data for similar soils in the surrounding area.
