ORLA SERIES

The Orla series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that developed in loamy gypsiferous materials of lacustrine or alluvial origin.  These soils are on level to gently sloping plains or depressional areas.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, gypsic, thermic Typic Haplogypsids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Orla clay loam, on smooth, nearly level area of 0.5 percent slope in rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A--0 to 5 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) weak very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky, and plastic; common fine roots; EC is 34 dS/m; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary.  (1 to 20 inches thick)

     Cky--5 to 23 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) silt loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist; massive; very hard, friable, sticky, and plastic; few fine roots; common fine pores; contains about 75 percent gypsum and CaCO3; EC is 20 dS/m; moderately alkaline, violently effervescent; clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 28 inches thick)

     Cy--23 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, sticky, and plastic; few fine roots; about 10 percent brownish opaque gypsum crystals 2 to 3 millimeters wide and up to 5 millimeters long; EC is 25 dS/m; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Reeves County, Texas; 5.15 miles south of Interstate 20 in Pecos on the old Fort Stockton road, then 100 feet east in rangeland.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - control section is dry more than half the time, and is moist for less than 90 cumulative days during the growing season. Typic aridic moisture regime.

Depth to gypsiferous materials: 1 to 20 inches

Apparent field texture of the control section: loam, silt loam, or clay loam

Clay content: 18 to 30 percent

Electrical conductivity: 4 dS/m to 36 dS/m.

Calcium carbonate content: 5 to 15 percent.

A horizon 
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR
Value:  5 to 8
Chroma:  2 to 4
Texture:  loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, or clay loam.

C horizon 
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR
Value:  5 to 8
Chroma:  1 to 4
Textures:  gypsiferous materials of loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay loam or clay loam texture.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils occur on nearly level to gently sloping outwash plains, or dissected remnants of old salt lakes.  Slopes are mainly 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 63 to about 66 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 12 inches.   Frost free days range from 210 to 240 days, and elevation ranges from 2,550 to 4,000 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the similar Hoban, Holloman, McCarran, and Reeves series and the Upton series.  Upton soils have a petrocalcic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is moderate.  Runoff is negligible on slopes less than 1 percent, and very low on 1 to 3 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Use is for rangeland and irrigated cropland.  Crops are cotton, alfalfa, and small grain.  Native vegetation consists of alkali sacaton, fourwing saltbush, mesquite, and allthorn.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Trans-Pecos area of west Texas (MLRA 42), and possibly southern New Mexico.  Series is of moderate extent.
