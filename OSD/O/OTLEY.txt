OTLEY SERIES

The Otley series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loess. These soils are on interfluves and side slopes on dissected till plains and on treads and risers on loess covered stream terraces. Slope ranges from 2 to 18 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 935 millimeters (36.8 inches).

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 43 to 93 centimeters (16.9 to 36.6 inches);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 155 centimeters (61 inches).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 43 centimeters (16.9 inches) (Ap, A1 and A2 horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 43 to 155 centimeters (61 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, and Btg4 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Thickness of the A horizon, depth to the horizon with highest clay content, thickness of Bt horizon, and depth to redoximorphic features decreases as gradient increases on convex slopes.

Oxyaquic subgroup based on a zone of saturation within 100 centimeters (39.4 inches) for 20 or more consecutive days or 30 or more cumulative days in normal years.
