ORR SERIES

The Orr series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks.  Orr soils are on fan remnants, stream terraces, inset fans, and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bissell, Bjork, Cowiche, Dodes, Fernpoint, Hullsgulch, Indiano, Jerusalem, Madras, Margerum, Noslo, Pahrange, Quailridge, Quiero, Ralls, Shoebend, Simcoe, Springmeyer, Truax, Uhaldi, and Wenatchee series.

Bissell, Noslo, Springmeyer, and Wenatchee soils have 25 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Bjork, Dodes, Indiano, Madras, Pahrange, Quiero, Shoebend, Simcoe, and Uhaldi soils have bedrock within 100 cm.  Cowiche soils have an A horizon and an upper Bt horizon formed in loess 46 to 100 cm thick over unconformable residuum and are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Fernpoint soils have argillic horizons that are less than 89 cm thick and have extremely gravelly or extremely cobbly 2C horizons.  Hullsgulch soils have horizons with lamellae below the argillic horizon.  Jerusalem soils have rock fragments that are mainly fine gravel of granitic lithology.  Margerum soils have 20 to 40 percent ash and pumice.  Quailridge soils are 30 to 64 cm to the base of the argillic horizon and have horizons with lamellae below the argillic horizon.  Ralls soils are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and are influenced by loess.  Truax soils have argillic horizons less than 81 cm thick, silica cementation in the C horizon, and average less than 15 percent rock fragments.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Orr soils are on fan remnants, stream terraces, inset fans, and hills.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks or in colluvium derived from sandstone and shale.   Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,341 to 2,134 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Oest and Reno soils along with the competing Springmeyer soil.  Oest soils are loamy-skeletal.  Reno soils are fine textured, moderately deep to duripans, and have ochric epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Orr soils are used for rangeland or irrigated cropland and pasture.  Crops are small grains, alfalfa, and pasture.  Vegetation in rangeland is principally Wyoming big sagebrush, Sandberg's bluegrass, cheatgrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western and central Nevada and northeastern California.  These soils are moderately extensive.  The series concept and main acreage is in MLRA 26, while other acreage occurs in MLRAs 23 and 28B.
