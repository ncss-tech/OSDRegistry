OJAI SERIES

The Ojai series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from material weathering from mostly sandstone or related sedimentary rocks.  Ojai soils are on alluvial fans and terraces and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 600 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Ventura Area, California 1917.

REMARKS:

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
Ochric epipedon: the zone from 0 to 41 cm
Argillic horizon: the zone from 41 to 140 cm
Particle-size control section: the zone from 41 to 91 cm

Some pedons in Ventura County have stony or cobbly textures throughout due to eroded surfaces or turned up during farm operations, and are included in this concept.

Ojai soils correlated in Los Angeles County have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the Bt horizons and are included in this concept

This series was reactivated in 2019 and updated to meet National Cooperative Soil Survey standards. The Ojai series was formerly combined with the Perkins series from Yuba County.

This soil was formerly classified as Noncalcic Brown soils.
