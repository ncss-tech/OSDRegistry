Remarks: Last updated by the state 12/1999. This update reflects the current format for official series descriptions.
LAN 2/2012 Update and changes of horizon nomenclature and range in characteristics is based on re-examination of correlation samples from the type location and extensive field work in MLRA 69.  Also updated the competing series section.
The competing soils Blancot, Buckle, Doakum, Mentomre, and Penistala are primarily in Land Resource Region (LRR) D.
The competing Yenlo soils are in LRR E.
