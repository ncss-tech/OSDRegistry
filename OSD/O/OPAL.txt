OPAL SERIES

The Opal series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in clayey sediments weathered from clay shale on dissected upland plains and hills.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 460 millimeters (18 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C (47 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bullcreek, Chantier, Dupree, Hurley, Lakoma, Promise, and Sansarc soils.  Bullcreek and Promise soils are on toeslopes and flats below the Opal soils.  They are more than 100 centimeters (about 40 inches) deep to shale.  Chantier soils are on steeper landscapes.  They do not have mollic epipedons and contain more salts.  Dupree and Sansarc soils typically are on steeper areas on the landscape.  They have bedrock at depths of 25 to 50 centimeters (about 10 to 20 inches).  Hurley soils are on less sloping landscapes.  They have a natric horizon.  Lakoma soils are on similar landscapes.  They do not have a mollic epipedon or intersecting slickensides.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage: Well drained  
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: Moderately low
Surface Runoff: medium to very high depending on slope

USE AND VEGETATION:  Cropland and grazing land.  Winter wheat, alfalfa, and sorghum are the principal crops.  Native vegetation is mainly western wheatgrass, green needlegrass, blue grama, sideoats grama, and sedges.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central South Dakota, mostly west of the Missouri River; Land Resource Region F, Northern Great Plains Spring Wheat Region and Land Resource Region G, Western Great Plains Range and Irrigated Region, Major Land Resource Area 54, 63A, and 63B.  The soil is extensive.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 41 centimeters [16 inches (A, Bss1 and Bss2 horizons)] ; Vertisol criteria - cracks to a depth of 66 centimeters [26 inches (Bss1, Bss2, and Bkss horizons)] and intersecting slickensides (Bss2 and Bkss horizons); Paralithic contact - the soft shale contact from 89 to 152 centimeters [35 to 60 inches (Cr1 and Cr2 horizons)].
