OLDSPAN SERIES


The Oldspan series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium from limestone and calcareous sandstone. Oldspan soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Clark County Area, Nevada, 2006. Proposed in  Clark County, Nevada, 1994. The name is coined from the Old Spanish Trail that runs through the area. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

Ochric epipedon - 0 to 7 inches (A and part of the Bw horizons). 

Cambic horizon - 3 to 10 inches (Bw horizon). 

Calcic horizon - 10 to 40 inches (Bk and 2Bkq1 horizons).
