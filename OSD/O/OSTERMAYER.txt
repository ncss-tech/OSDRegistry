OSTERMAYER SERIES

The Ostermayer series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity (moderately permeable) soils that formed in eolian deposits over loamy and clayey fluviomarine deposits. These nearly level soils occur on tidal flats on barrier islands. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1245 mm (49 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (70 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, active, nonacid, hyperthermic Sodic Endoaquents

COMPETING SERIES: 
These are the Freeportand Karankawa series in the same family. Similar soils are Nass, Madre, Mustang, Satatton, and Tatton series. 
Freeport soils: remain saturated to the surface after low tide; have vegetation
Karankawa soils: submerged for longer periods; have mucky surface textures
Nass soils: very poorly drained; have electrical conductivity values less than 25 dS/m throughoutlower electrical conductivity values throughout.
Madre, Mustang, Satatton, and Tatton soils: sandy particle-size control section; siliceous mineralogy

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Slope: 0 to 1 percent but mostly less than 0.5 percent
Precipitation Pattern: Precipitation is generally uniform throughout the year with slight peaks in the spring and fall months
Mean annual precipitation: 1143 to 1295 mm (45 to 51 in)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
These are the Brazosport, Freeport, Galveston, and Karankawa series.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage class: poor 
Permeability class: moderate (moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity)
Runoff: high 
Flooding: very frequent frequency from daily tides, for very brief (4 to 48 hours) duration
Seasonal water table: Endosaturation occurs from 15 cm to 2 m (0.5 to 8 feet) throughout the year. As high tides recede, these areas remain saturated throughout. 

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Major uses: wildlife habitat
Native vegetation: these areas do not have vegetation and some areas have an algal mat

Extent: small

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES PROPOSED: Galveston County, Texas, 2020. The name is from a cove near the type location.

REMARKS: The series was formerly included in the Mustang series. The series was separated based on differences in water table depth, salinity, and vegetation.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: 25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in) 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 in) (Ag horizon) 
Endosaturation and aquic conditions: 0 to 203 cm (0 to 80 in) (Ag, Cg1, Cg2,2Cg1 and 2Cg2 horizons)
Lithologic discontinuity: 115 to 203 cm (45 to 80 in). 

Additional Comments: The lithologic discontinuity is evident as an increase in clay due to the Beaumont Formation and ancient Brazos River. This paleo-surface is deeper in pedons on Galveston Island and shallower on the southwest end of Follets Island. Some areas are firm enough during low tide to allow light vehicular traffic.

ADDITIONAL DATA: MLRA Soil Survey Office data are available on S2020TX0397171 at the series type location.
