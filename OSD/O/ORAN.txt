ORAN SERIES

The Oran series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in 30 to 66 centimeters of silty or loamy sediments and the underlying loamy glacial till. These soils are on interfluves and long side slopes on dissected till plains on the Iowan Erosion Surface. Slope ranges from 0 to 9 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 838 millimeters.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--somewhat poorly drained--a frequently saturated zone occurs at a depth of 0.3 meter during April to June in normal years and both perched and apparent saturation can occur on this soil based on the season and intensity of rainfall during a given period of time
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--1.00 to 10.00 micrometers per second (moderately high) in the silty or loamy sediments and 0.01 to 1.00 micrometers per second (low or moderately low) in the glacial till
Surface runoff potential--negligible to low

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are cultivated. The principal crops are corn, small grains, soybeans, and hay. The native vegetation is big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, other grasses of the tall grass prairie and mixed deciduous trees.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Bremer County, Iowa, 1965

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 46 to 96 centimeters (2Bt1 and 2Bt2 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (Ap, E, BE, 2Bt1, 2Bt2, and 2BC horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 33 centimeters (Ap and E horizons);
albic horizon--the zone from a depth of 20 to 33 centimeters (E horizon);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 46 to 114 centimeters (2Bt1 and 2Bt2 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Some pedons have vertical seams or wedges of sand or loamy sand about 5 to 30 centimeters wide and about 0.9 to 1.2 meters deep extending downward from the stone line into the glacial till.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

Aquollic subgroup based on matrix value of 2 in the zone from the surface to a depth of 20 centimeters (Ap horizon) and redoximorphic depletions in the zone from a depth of 46 to 86 centimeters (2Bt1 horizon).

Taxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, tenth edition, 2006.

The change to bulk density of 1.75 to 1.90 gm/cc and low to moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity was based on field and lab data and supported by the MLRA 104 steering committee.

Not all pedons have the increase in clay content necessary for an argillic horizon however, this is waived due to the change in parent materials.
