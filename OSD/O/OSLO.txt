REMARKS:
  
These soils were formerly included in the Portales and Zita series.  

Many pedons, as the one in this description, have argillic horizons in the lower parts of the upper solum between 50 to 100 cm (20 to 40 in) that have been engulfed and destroyed by accumulation of carbonates.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 28 cm (0 to 11 in) (Ap1, Ap2 horizons)
Secondary carbonates: 28 to 203 cm (11 to 80 in) (Btk1, Btk2, 2Bkk, 2Btk1, and 2Btk2 horizons)
Argillic horizon: 28 to 84 cm (11 to 33 in) (Btk1, Btk2 horizons)
