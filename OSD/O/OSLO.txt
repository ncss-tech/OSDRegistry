OSLO SERIES

The Oslo series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy, calcareous eolian sediments of Pleistocene age.  These soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping eolian plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 496 mm (19 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 13 degrees C (56 degrees F).

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained and moderate permeability.  Runoff is negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes, very low on 1 to 5 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for crop production.  Principal crops are corn, soybeans, grain sorghum, and winter wheat.  A considerable amount of acreage is irrigated.  Climax vegetation is dominantly short grasses with a few mid grasses and includes blue grama and buffalograss, with lesser amounts of vine-mesquite, western wheatgrass, sideoats grama, galleta, or tobosa, silver bluestem, wild alfalfa, and prairie clover.  This soil has been correlated to the Limey Upland (R-077AY006TX) ecological site in MLRA-77A.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern High Plains, Northern Part (MLRA 77A in LRR H) of Texas north of the Canadian River, and possibly in adjoining areas of Oklahoma.  The series is of moderate extent.
