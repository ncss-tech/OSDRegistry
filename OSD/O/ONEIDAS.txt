ONEIDAS SERIES

The Oneidas series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in glacial outwash derived from mixed materials. The Oneidas soils are on outwash terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 800 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Coarse-loamy, mixed, active, frigid Fragiaquic Haploxeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Oneidas coarse sandy loam on a north west facing (315 degree), 1 percent slope at an elevation of 1957 meters. When described on 08/15/1968 the soil was dry above and moist below 75 inches. Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Oneidas soils are on outwash terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. These soils formed in outwash derived from mixed materials predominantly granodiorite.  Elevation is 1905 to 2050 meters.  The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cold wet winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 584 to 838 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is 5 to 8 degrees C. The frost free season is 40 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Jabu and Christopher soils. The Jabu soils are greater than 100 centimeters deep to fragic properties. Christopher soils do not have fragic properties or an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained, slow permeability, very high runoff.  These soils are not flooded or ponded.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for wildlife, recreation and urban development.  Vegetation is mixed conifers, typically lodgepole pine with an understory of shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Oneidas is of minor extent in California and Nevada in MLRA 22A -- Sierra Nevada Range
