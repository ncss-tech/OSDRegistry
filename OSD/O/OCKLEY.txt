OCKLEY SERIES

The Ockley series consists of very deep, well drained soils that are deep or very deep to calcareous, stratified sandy and gravelly outwash. Ockley soils formed in as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of loess or silty material and in the underlying loamy outwash. They are commonly on stream terraces and outwash plains, and less commonly on kame moraines and eskers. Slope ranges from 0 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ockley soils are commonly on stream terraces and outwash plains, and less commonly on kame moraines and eskers. Slope gradient commonly is 0 to 6 percent on stream terraces and outwash plains, and 2 to 30 percent on kame moraines and eskers. The soils formed in as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of loess or silty material and in the underlying loamy outwash. They are deep or very deep to calcareous, stratified sandy and gravelly outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1143 mm (30 to 45 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 13 degrees C (47 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 180 days. Elevation is 122 to 335 meters (400 to 1,100 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: They are commonly associated with Fox, Rush, Sleeth, and Westland soils on outwash plains and stream terraces. They are less commonly associated with Miami and Russell soils which are on adjacent till plains. The well drained Fox soils are moderately deep to stratified gravelly and sandy outwash and are typically on shoulders and backslopes. The moderately well drained Miami and well drained Russell soils are on summits, shoulders, and backslopes of dissected till plains. The well drained, more silty Rush soils are on similar landforms as the Ockley soils. The somewhat poorly drained Sleeth soils are on nearly level summits of outwash plains. The poorly drained and very poorly drained Westland soils are in depressions on outwash plains and stream terraces.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to high depending on slope. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and very high in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate in the solum and very rapid in the underlying material.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of these soils are used to grow corn, soybeans, wheat and hay. Native vegetation is dominantly mixed hardwood forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central and southeastern Indiana, central and northern Illinois, southwestern Michigan, central and southern Ohio, and southern Wisconsin; dominantly in MLRA 111A, 111B, 111D, and 111E, and to a lesser extent in MLRAs 108A, 95B, 97, 98, and 114A. The type location is in MLRA 111A. The series is of large extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Carroll County, Indiana, 1955.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 38 cm (Ap, BA horizons).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 38 to 124 cm (Bt, 2Bt horizons).

Till substratum, sandy substratum, and bedrock substratum phases are recognized. These will likely be proposed as new series when the subset surveys with these phases are updated.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available for the typical pedon, S1979IN139009, from the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory (KSSL), Lincoln, Nebraska. Data for pedons sampled by the Agricultural Experiment Station at Purdue University and at The Ohio State University are also available from KSSL.
