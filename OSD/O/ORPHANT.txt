ORPHANT SERIES

The Orphant series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium derived from dominantly volcanic rocks.  Orphant soils are on fan piedmonts and fan skirts.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Argidic Argidurids

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Belted, Deppy, Dobel, and Vylach series.  

Belted soils have a duripan at 15 to 36 cm. Deppy soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 9.5 degrees C> Dobel soils have an indurated duripan within 50 to 100 cm.  Vylach soils have bedrock at a depth of 50 to 75 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Orphant soils are on fan piedmonts and fan skirts at elevations of 1,680 to 1,890 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium derived from dominantly volcanic rocks.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is about 11 to 13 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Broe, Pintwater and Roic soils. Broe soils have a sandy particle-size control section and durinodes in a friable matrix. Pintwater soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 50 cm.  Roic soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 50 cm.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity above the duripan.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is principally shadscale, bud sagebrush and galleta with some littleleaf horsebrush and kochia.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Nevada.  These soils are inextensive. MLRA 29
