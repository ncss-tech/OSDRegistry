TYPICAL PEDON: Owhat peat - on a slope of 12 percent under shrub birch-mixed ericaceous shrub/sedge scrub. (All colors are for moist soil)

	Oi--0 to 6 inches (0 to 15 cm); dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) slightly decomposed plant material; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; very strongly acid (pH 5.2); clear wavy boundary.

	Oe--6 to 10 inches (15 to 25 cm); very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) moderately decomposed plant material; many very, fine, and medium roots; very strongly acid (pH 5.2); clear wavy boundary.

	A--10 to 14 inches (25 to 36 cm); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) and dark brown (10YR 3/3) silt loam; weak thin platy structure; very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; strongly acid (pH 5.4); abrupt wavy boundary.

	Af--14 to 60 inches (36 to 152 cm); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) and dark brown (10YR 3/3) permanently frozen silt loam; few very fine and fine roots; strongly acid (pH 5.4).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this classification.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landforms: hills
Parent material: silty eolian deposits
Elevation: 2,392 to 2,720 feet (729 to 829 m)
Slope: 2 to 15 percent
Annual precipitation: 28 to 33 inches (722 to 848 mm)
Annual temperature: 25 degrees F (-4 degrees C)
Frost-free period: 60 to 80 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Fields soils. Fields soils are well drained, moderately deep to bedrock, and occur on mountains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained, very high runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high above the permafrost and very low in the permafrost.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat and recreation. Native vegetation is shrub birch-mixed ericaceous shrub/sedge scrub.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 228, Interior Alaska Mountains, Alaska. The series is of small extent.
