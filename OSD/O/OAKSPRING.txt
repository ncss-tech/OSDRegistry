OAKSPRING SERIES

The Oakspring series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Oakspring soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Cumulic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Oakspring gravelly silt loam, on a east facing, linear to concave, 14 percent slope in oak at an elevation of 5,828 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The surface is covered by 10 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones of mixed origin and subangular in shape.

    A1--0 to 4 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly silt loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate fine and very fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, few fine and medium roots; many very fine, few fine and medium tubular and interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.

    A2--4 to 18 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly silt loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure structure parting to weak fine and very fine granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, few fine and medium roots; many very fine, few fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; very slightly effervescent, (3 percent calcium carbonate), carbonates are disseminated; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual wavy boundary.

    A3--18 to 24 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) cobbly silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, few fine and medium roots; many very fine, few fine tubular pores; few fine masses of organic matter; 10 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent, (6 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated and segregated in less than 1 mm thick coats on undersides of rocks; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (total thickness of A horizons - 24 to 38 inches thick)

    Bk1--24 to 30 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) cobbly silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, few fine and medium roots; common very fine, few fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent, (9 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated and segregated in common fine irregular shaped soft masses and in less than 1 mm thick coats around rocks; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary.

    Bk2--30 to 50 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly silty loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent, (9 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated and segregated in common fine irregular shaped soft masses and in less than 1 mm thick coats around rocks; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (total thickness of Bk horizons - 10 to 30 inches)

    2Bk3--50 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent, (10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated and segregated in common fine irregular shaped soft masses and in less than 1 mm thick coats around rocks; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).
