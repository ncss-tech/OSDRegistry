OAKSIDE SERIES

The Oakside series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metasedimentary and sedimentary rocks. These soils are on mountains and have slopes of 50 to 110 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 1500 millimeters (59 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, isotic, mesic Lithic Ultic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Oakside very channery silt loam - under a stand of canyon live oak, tanoak, Douglas-fir and madrone with a surface cover of 20 percent gravels, 10 percent cobbles, 2 percent stone and 1 percent boulders. When described on April 12, 2001, the soil was moist throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated).

        Oi--0 to 4 centimeters (0 to 2 inches); slightly decomposed plant material; abrupt smooth boundary.

        Oe--4 to 9 centimeters (2 to 4 inches); moderately decomposed plant material; abrupt smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of O horizons 0 to 15 centimeters) 

        A--9 to 24 centimeters (4 to 9 inches); brown (10YR 5/3), very channery silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) broken face, moist; weak fine granular structure; very friable, soft, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; moderately few fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 50 percent flat subangular channers; moderately acid, (pH 5.6), clear wavy boundary. (10 to 25 centimeters thick)

        Bw--24 to 47 centimeters (9 to 18 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), extremely channery loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) broken face, moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable, soft, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; very few fine and common very coarse roots; many fine irregular pores; 65 percent subangular channers; moderately acid, (pH 5.6), abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 30 centimeters thick)

        R--47 centimeters (18 inches); hard, fractured phyllite with some soil material in fractures, fractures greater than 25 centimeter (10 inches) apart.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil Moisture: The soil moisture control section is dry from July 1st to October 15th and moist in all parts from November 15 to June 1st.  This soil has a xeric soil moisture regime. 

Soil Temperature: The mean annual soil temperature is 10 to 15 degrees C (50 to 59 degrees F).  The difference between the mean summer and mean winter temperature is greater than 6 degrees C.

Depth to lithic bedrock: 25 to 50 centimeters (10 to 20 inches).


Base Saturation (by ammonium acetate) is greater than 50 percent throughout the profile.  Base saturation (by sum of cations) is less than 75 percent in one or more horizons between the mineral surface and the lithic contact.

Soil Reaction: slightly acid to moderately acid throughout the soil profile.

Surface fragments: 0 to 65 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, 0 to 5 percent stones.

Particle Size Control Section (by weighted average): 
Clay: 10 to 25 percent clay. 
Rock fragments: 35 to 80 percent gravel and 0 to 55 percent cobbles.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cassyhill and Rufus series.  The Cassyhill and Rufus soils have greater than 5 percent volcanic glass content within the particle size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils occur on mountains with slopes of 30 to 110 (50 to 110 above) percent at elevations of 19 to 1386 meters (62 to 4547 feet). These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and metasedimentary rocks, schist and phyllite. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. The mean annual precipitation is 1250 to 2030 millimeters (49 to 80 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F). Mean summer temperature is 14 degrees C (58 degrees F) and the mean winter temperature is about 7 degrees C (44 degrees F). The mean annual temperature is 10 to 15 degrees C (50 to 59 degrees F).  The frost free period is about 150 to 250 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Darkwoods, Firmountain, and Redtop soils. Darkwoods and Firmountain soils are greater than 150 centimeters (60 inches) to bedrock. Redtop soils greater than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; high runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat and watershed. Native vegetation is Canyon live oak, tanoak, with scattered Douglas-fir.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Siskyou-Trinity Area, MLRA 5. The series is not extensive.
