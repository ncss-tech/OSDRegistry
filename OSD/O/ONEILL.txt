ONEILL SERIES

The Oneill series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy material 20 to 40 inches deep over gravelly sand.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the solum and very rapid in the underlying material.  These soils are on uplands and terraces with slopes ranging from 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Oneill fine sandy loam - on a 1 percent convex northeast-facing slope in a cultivated field.  When described, the soil was moist through-out.  (Colors are for dry soil, unless otherwise stated.)

Ap--0 to 5 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse platy structure parting to weak fine granular; slightly hard, friable; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 9 inches thick)

A--5 to 8 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 11 inches thick)

Bw1--8 to 16 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 10 inches thick)

Bw2--16 to 26 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (7 to 13 inches thick)

2C1--26 to 32 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; single grain; soft, very friable; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 8 inches thick)

2C2--32 to 80 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) coarse sand and gravel, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; single grain; loose; neutral.

TYPE LOCATION:  Brown County, Nebraska; 3 miles north and 2 1/2 miles west of Ainsworth; 1,840 feet north and 50 feet west of the southeast corner of section 5, T. 30 N., R. 22 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum typically is about 26 inches and ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches and includes the A horizon and in some pedons the upper part of the B horizon.  The soil ranges from strongly acid to neutral.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.

The Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 through 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  In a few pedons, clay has accumulated in the lower part of the Bw2 horizon so that the layer is noticeably finer in texture than the layer above and below.

The 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 through 8 and 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is gravelly sand, coarse sand, or sand.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Oneill soils are on stream terraces and uplands bordering drainageways.  Slope gradient commonly is 2 percent and ranges from 0 to 30 percent.  Oneill soils formed in loamy material 20 to 40 inches deep over gravelly sand.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 24 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 48 degrees to 52 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brocksburg, Dunday, Jansen, Meadin, Simeon, and Valentine.  Brocksburg and Jansen soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and Brocksburg soils have mollic colors deeper than 20 inches.  These soils occur in a lower position on the landscape.  Dunday soils lack 2C horizon of sand and gravel and are on nearly level to undulating areas above areas of Oneill.  Meadin soils are sandy-skeletal and are on steeper slopes below the Oneill soils.  Simeon and Valentine soils lack mollic epipedons and occur on higher landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is low to moderately high. Permeability is moderately rapid in the solum and very rapid in the underlying material.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mostly cultivated.  Corn and sorghum are the principal crops under dry farming.  Corn, sorghum, alfalfa, and soybeans are grown where the soil is irrigated.  Slopes steeper than 4 percent have usually been kept in or returned to grass.  Native vegetation is tall and midgrasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Nebraska.  Oneill soils are extensive.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of approximately 16 inches.  These soils need further study to determin possible placement in a coarse-loamy family.
