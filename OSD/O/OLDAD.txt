OLDAD SERIES

The Oldad series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian deposits over alluvium from granitoid, gneiss, diorite and limestone. Oldad soils are on sand sheets over fan remnants. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters (4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.5 degrees C (71 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Buzzardsprings (CA) and Superstition (AZ+CA) series. Buzzardsprings soils have a calcic horizon with an upper boundary between 10 and 36 centimeters (3 to 14 inches). Superstition soils are on dunes and have less than 5 percent rock fragments throughout. In addition, Superstition soils receive mostly summer precipitation. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Oldad soils are on sand sheets over fan remnants.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. These soils formed in eolian deposits over alluvium from granitoid, gneiss, diorite and limestone. Elevations range from 310 to 725 meters (1017 to 2378 feet). The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 millimeters (3 to 5 inches); mean annual air temperature is 20 to 23 degrees C (68 to 73.4 degrees F). The frost-free season is 300 to 340 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Dalelake, Sheephole and Sunmill soils. Dalelake soils are on adjacent sand sheets, Sheephole soils are on adjacent sand sheets over fan aprons and Sunmill soils are on nearby fan remnants. Dalelake soils do not have a calcic horizon. Sheephole soils do not have a calcic horizon and have a horizon within the particle-size control section with greater than 35 percent rock fragments. Sunmill soils have an argillic horizon with its upper boundary 25 to 50 centimeters (10 to 20 inches) below the mineral soil surface.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Oldad soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly creosote bush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southeastern California, U.S.A., MLRA 30. The series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: PHOENIX, ARIZONA

SERIES PROPOSED: San Bernardino, California; Soil Survey of the Mojave National Preserve Area, California, 2012. The name is coined from Old Dad Mountain located 15 kilometers (9 miles) to the south-southeast of the typical pedon. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:

Ochric epipedon - from a depth of 0 to 4 centimeters (0 to 2 inches) (A horizon).
Calcic horizon - from a depth of 61 to 103 centimeters (24 to 41 inches) (2Bkq horizon).
Particle-size control section - from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters (10 to 40 inches) (part of the Ck1, Ck2 and 2Bkq horizons).
