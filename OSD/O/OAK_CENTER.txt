OAK CENTER SERIES

The Oak Center series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in 100 to 150 centimeters of loess over siliceous sandy residuum and sandstone bedrock.  These soils are on linear and convex slopes on interfluves and side slopes on uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 863 millimeters.

The underlying bedrock consists of siliceous sandstone and has color similar to the 3C horizon described above. Narrow joints containing residuum are common in the sandstone. In some pedons, the sandstone can be easily dug with a spade, but in other areas the sandstone is more consolidated and digging with a spade is difficult.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 23 to 74 centimeters (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (Ap, Bt1, Bt2, 2Bt3, and 3C horizons). 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 23 centimeters (Ap horizon);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 23 to 137 centimeters (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons);
udic moisture regime. 

In previously surveyed areas, these soils were included in soils associated with limestone bedrock.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
