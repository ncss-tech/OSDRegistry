OHTOG SERIES 

The Ohtog series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.  These soils are on alluvial flats.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ohtog loam, 2 to 4 percent slopes - abandoned cropland. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.) 

    Ap--0 to 9 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, few fine and medium roots; many very fine, common fine, few medium tubular pores; slightly effervescent (7 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 11 inches thick) 

    C1--9 to 18 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine, common fine, few medium tubular pores; slightly effervescent (8 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 15 inches thick) 

    C2--18 to 28 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots; common very fine, few fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent (7 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 29 inches thick) 

    Cy1--28 to 37 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and few fine tubular pores; few fine round shaped masses of gypsum; slightly effervescent (6 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary. (7 to 36 inches thick) 

    Cy2--37 to 53 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and few fine tubular pores; common fine cylinder shaped masses of gypsum; slightly effervescent (1 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (11 to 20 inches thick) 

    Ck--53 to 60 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and few fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent (14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated and in few fine irregular shaped masses; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2). 

TYPE LOCATION:  Uintah County, Utah; about 2 miles east of Roosevelt, Utah; 650 feet north and 1,600 feet east of the southwest corner of sec. 18 , T. 2 S., R. 1 E., USBM; USGS Roosevelt, Utah quadrangle; 40 degrees, 18 minutes, 15 seconds north latitude and 109 degrees, 55 minutes, 44 seconds west longitude; NAD 027. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture:  The soil moisture control section is affected by precipitation that falls throughout the year, with a slight increase in late summer and fall.  The moisture regime is aridic.
Mean annual soil temperature:  47 to 50 degrees F.

Particle size control section:  18 to 30 percent clay

A horizon:
Hue:  5YR or 7.5YR
Value:  5 or 6 dry, and 3 or 4 moist
Chroma:  4 to 6
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 5 to 15 percent
Salinity:  0 to 4 mmhos/cm

C horizon:
Hue:  2.5YR or 5YR
Value:  5 to 7 dry, and 3 to 5 moist
Chroma:  3 to 6
Texture:  dominantly loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, fine sandy loam, and sandy loam with thin layers of loamy sand
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 5 to 15 percent
Gypsum: 0 to 2 percent
Salinity:  0 to 4 mmhos/cm

COMPETING SERIES:  Current competitors are the Greybull and Turzo series.  Competitors prior to the Eighth Edition, 1998 Keys to Soil Taxonomy are the Gotho, Hostage, Montwel, Norland, Teapo, and Turley series.

Greybull, Montwel and Teapo soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact.

Gotho Norland, and Turley soils have mean annual soil temperatures greater than 50 degrees F.

Hostage soils are deep to a paralithic contact with shale.

Turzo soils have hue yellower than 5YR in the C horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: alluvium derived from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks
Landform: alluvial flats
Slopes:  0 to 4 percent
Elevation:  4,600 to 5,400 feet
Mean annual precipitation:  5 to 8 inches
Mean annual temperature:  45 to 47 degrees F.
Frost-free period:  110 to 125 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Jenrid, Shotnick, Stygee, and the competing Montwel and Turzo  soils.  Jenrid and Shotnick soils have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections. Stygee soils have fine particle-size control sections.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very low or low runoff;  moderately slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally for irrigated cropland and rangeland.  Potential vegetation consists of basin wildrye, basin big sagebrush, needleandthread and western wheatgrass.  These soils have been correlated to the Loamy Bottom (Basin Big Sagebrush) - 034XY009UT range site in Utah. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern, Utah; LRR D; MLRA 34.  Ohtog series is of minor extent.
