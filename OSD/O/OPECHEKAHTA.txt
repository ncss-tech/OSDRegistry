OPECHEKAHTA SERIES

The Opechekahta series consists of deep to very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived primarily from limestone over residuum derived from red silty shale.  Opechekahta soils are on escarpments and in canyons in foothills and mountains.  Slopes range from 10 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees  C.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Citadel and Citivar (T) - have fine-textured particle-size control sections; they generally occur on backslopes and footslopes 
below Opechekahta soils
Rockerville - shallow to hard limestone; they occuron ridge crests above Opechekahta soils
Vanocker - has a thin argillic horizon, more than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section, and does not have a lithologic discontinuity in the series control section; they occur on similar landforms as Opechekahta soils

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium to very rapid runoff; saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high

USE AND VEGETATION:  Opechekahta soils are typically wooded and utilized for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation consists of an overstory of ponderosa pine and bur oak; understory species include ground juniper, eastern hophornbean, western wheatgrass, Richardson needlegrass, and bluegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Low Limestone Plateau and Limestone Bench physiographic areas of the Black Hills of South Dakota; LRR G, MLRA 62 in South Dakota and Wyoming; the series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Denver, Colorado

SERIES PROPOSED:  Proposed during the Update Soil Survey of Lawrence County, South Dakota.  The name is coined from the geologic formations that contribute to the formation of this soil.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Bk1, 2Bk2, 2CBk, and 3C horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 1 to 6 cm (A horizon)
Calcic horizon:  The zone from 16 to 57 cm (Bk1 and 2Bk2 horizons)
Paralithic contact:  The contact with red silty shale at 133 cm (3Cr1 and 3Cr2 horizons)
Lithologic discontinuity:  At the upper boundary of the 2Bk2 horizon and at the upper boundary of the 3Ck horizon

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

Opechekahta soils appear to have been previously mapped as Vanocker or Sawdust in other soil survey subsets of MLRA 62.
