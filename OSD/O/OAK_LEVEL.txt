MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Halifax County, Virginia, 2004. 

REMARKS: Oak Level soils were previously mapped as Mecklenburg soils. The creation of a mesic region within the southern Piedmont necessitated that a new series be established as a counterpart to the Mecklenburg series. 

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 8 to 42 inches (Bt horizon) 
Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches
