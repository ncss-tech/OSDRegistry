OLAND SERIES



The Oland series consists of very deep, well drained soils on benches,

mountainsides, and canyon slopes.  They formed in material weathered

from granitic rocks.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes are 10 to 90

percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and the

average annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Pachic Ultic Haploxerolls

Haploxerolls.



TYPICAL PEDON:  Oland silt loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil

unless otherwise noted.)



    A1--0 to 4 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam,

black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very

friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few

coarse roots; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 18 inches

thick)



    A2--4 to 11 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, very

dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very

friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few

coarse roots; 10 percent fine pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear

wavy boundary.  (0 to 16 inches thick)



    Bw1--11 to 26 inches; dark brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly loam, dark

brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure;

slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many

very fine and fine, and few coarse roots; 20 percent pebbles; slightly

acid (pH 6.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 15 inches thick)



    Bw2--26 to 40 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly loam, dark

yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate very fine subangular blocky

structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly plastic; many very

fine and fine, and few coarse roots; 50 percent pebbles and 5 percent

cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 20 inches

thick)



    C--40 to 70 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) extremely

gravelly sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak very fine

subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable; few fine roots; 80

percent pebbles and 15 percent cobbles; slightly weathered schist among

larger fragments; slightly acid (pH 6.4).



TYPE LOCATION:  Idaho County, Idaho; about 6 miles south of Riggins,

about 1,490 feet north and 580 feet east of the southwest corner of

section 20, T.23N., R.1E.



RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:



Average annual soil temperature - 47 to 51 degrees F

Mollic epipedon thickness - 20 to 30 inches

Base saturation - 50 to 75 percent in some part of the upper 30 inches

Rock fragments in control section - 35 to 60 percent



A horizon

Hue - 10YR or 7.5YR

Value - 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist

Chroma - 1 through 3



Bw horizon

Value - 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist

Chroma - 2 or 3

Texture - GR-L, GRV-L, CB-L, CBV-L



C horizon

Texture - GRV-L, GRV-SL, GRX-SL, CBV-SL, CBX-SL



COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Emily, Fantz, Lauren, and Woolstalf

series.  Lauren soils are somewhat excessively drained and have

volcanic ash in the parent material.  Emily soils are moderately fine

textured in the B horizon.  Fantz soils are less than 40 inches deep to

bedrock.  Woolstalf soils have less than 18 percent clay in the control

section.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Oland soils are on benches, mountainsides, and

steep canyon slopes and have slopes of 2 to 90 percent.  They formed in

weathered colluvium and residuum from granite.  Elevation is 2,400 to

5,500 feet.  The climate is subhumid continental.  Average annual

precipitation is 15 to 22 inches.  Average January temperatues is 27

degrees F; average July temperature is 66 degrees F.  Average annual

temperature is 45 to 49 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 90 to

130 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brower and Oland

Variant soils.  Brower soils have thinner surface layers.  Oland

Variant soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control

layer.  These soils are on landscape positions similar to Oland soils.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to very rapid runoff;

moderate permeability.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for rangeland.  Vegetation is mainly

mountain big sagebrush, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, bluegrass,

and snowberry.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  These soils are moderately extensive in

Idaho.
