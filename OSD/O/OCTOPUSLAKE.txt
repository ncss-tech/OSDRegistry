COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ekiligamut (AK), Grayslake (ID), Koyuktolik (AK), Mariel (OR), Snakeriver (AK), and Wocus (OR) soils. 
Greyslake, Mariel, and Wocus do not occur in Alaska
Ekiligamut soils have a mineral contact within 150 cm of the surface and occur and elevations from 0 to 15m (0 to 50 ft) 
Grayslake soils have pH values 6.5 or greater in all horizons and occur at elevations above above 1900 m (6235 ft). 
Koyuktolik soils have loam or sandy loam mineral soil layer that is 20 to 45 percent coarse fragments; strata of volcanic ash in Oe horizon, and an elevation of 3 to 300m (10 to 985 ft)
Mariel soils have sapric material starting at 86 cm (34 in), mean annual precipitation of 1270 to 2900 mm (50 to 114 in).
Snakeriver soils have fibric material on the surface of the pedon, a mean annual soil temperature of 1 to 3 degrees C (34 to 37 degrees F), and occur at elevations between 0 and 560m (0 to 835 ft).
Wocus soils have a limnic horizon containing diatomaceous silt loam.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Elevation: 300 to 1200 meters (985 to 3935 ft) 
Parent material: mossy organic material
Landform: depressions on hills
Slopes: 0 to 2 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 300 to 800 mm (12 to 31 in)
Mean annual air temperature: -4 to -2 degrees C. (25 to 28 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 20 to 75 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ahtell, Dodger, Klawasi, Squirrelcreek, Stibnite, and Summitlake soils.
Ahtell soils are well drained, lack permafrost, have folistic and umbric epipedons, and occur on hill tops, and hillside positions.
Dodger soils are an organic permafrost soil, there is a silty clay loam texture in the upper mineral horizons, and occur on outwash terraces on mountains. 
Klawasi soils are a very poorly drained, they are mineral soils, have permafrost, a histic epipedon, a loess cap over clayey lacustrine sediments, and occur on lacustrine terraces.
Squirrelcreek soils are somewhat excessively drained,they are mineral soils, form on alluvium parent material, and occur on bluffs, floodplains, and river valleys in outwash plains.
Stibnite soils are well drained, has a silt loam surface texture, 15 to 35 cm (6 to 14 in) cambic horizon, and occur in till plains, mountains, kames and kettles.
Summitlake soils are poorly drained, they are mineral soils, and occur on lake plains and depressions in foothills.
