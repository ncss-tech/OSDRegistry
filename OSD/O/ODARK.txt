ODARK SERIES


The Odark series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium, glacial till and earthflow deposits derived from mixed rock sources.  These soils are on mountain sideslopes, hills, swales, drainageways, alluvial fans and kame terraces.  Slopes are 15 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Booneville and Adel series.  Booneville soils are loamy-skeletal and are on concave back slopes and foot slopes of mountains and foothills.  Adel soils are fine-loamy and are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, hills, drainageways and swales.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Odark soils are used mainly for understory grazing and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is mainly Douglas fir, common snowberry, ninebark, pinegrass, Kentucky bluegrass, elk sedge, western meadowrue and serviceberry with choke cherry, wild rose, hawthorn, quaking aspen and Engelmann spruce occupying north facing moist sites. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Odark soils are of small extent in south western and south central Montana.  MLRA 43B.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.  

SERIES PROPOSED: Park County, Montana, 2005.  Odark is a coined name.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

Mollic epipedon - the zone 4 to 27 inches (A and Bt1 horizons).

Argillic horizon - the zone from 17 to 60 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4 horizons).

Particle size control section - the zone from 17 to 37 inches (Bt1 and part of the Bt2 horizon).
