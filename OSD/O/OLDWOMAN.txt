OLDWOMAN SERIES

The Oldwoman series consists of very deep, well-drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. The Oldwoman soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Bitter Spring (NV) series. Bitter Spring soils are 25 centimeters or shallower to top of calcic horizon, are redder throughout most of the profile and have more than 18 percent clay in the upper part of the argillic. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Oldwoman soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. These soils formed in mixed alluvium. Elevations range from 914 to 1128 meters. The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 millimeters; mean annual air temperature is 17 to 20 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 300 to 340 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Typic Haplargids (T), Typic Torriorthents (T), Daisy (T), Gravesumit and Noagua (T) soils. Typic Haplargids are found on fan aprons over fan remnants and have a fine-loamy particle size control section. Typic Torriorthents are found in the channels between remnants, are sandy throughout the particle size control section and do not have an argillic horizon or calcic horizon. Daisy and Gravesumit soils are on fan aprons and alluvial fans over fan remnants. Daisy soils have greater than 50 cm of sand overlying the argillic horizon and Gravesumit soils are not skeletal. Noagua soils are on alluvial fans over fan remnants, have a duripan horizon and are not skeletal. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; very low to low runoff; moderate permeability in the upper part of the profile and rapid in the substratum. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Oldwoman soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly sparse coverage of creosotebush and white bursage. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southeastern California. MLRA 30. These soils are of small extent.
