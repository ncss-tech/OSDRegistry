OTA SERIES

The Ota series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and volcanic ash mixed with colluvium over residuum from cinders and pumice. Slopes range from 15 to 50 percent on lava plains. The average annual precipitation is about 200 millimeters and the average annual temperature is about 11.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal over cindery, isotic over glassy, mesic Vitrixerandic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Ota gravelly ashy loam -- on a 43 percent convex northwest-facing slope at 1,028 meters elevation in rangeland. The surface has about 1 percent stone cover. When described on August 19, 1999, the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(10 to 38 cm thick)

	2Bkq3--97 to 180 cm; gravel (cinders and pumice); fragmental; common thin to thick coats of calcium carbonate and silica in vesicles and on undersides of rock fragments; 85 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; 10 percent voids of 2 to 50 mm.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. The Suppah soils are similar, but do not have calcic horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ota soils are on cinder cones and shield volcanoes on lava plains at elevations of 935 to 1,075 meters. Slopes range from 15 to 50 percent. These soils formed in loess and volcanic ash mixed with colluvium over residuum from cinders and pumice. Average annual precipitation is 200 to 230 cm. Average annual temperature is 11 to 12 degrees C. Frost-free period is 140 to 155 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Montezuma soils which are ashy and on footslopes of cinder cones.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; moderate over very rapid saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Ota soils are used mainly for wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, spiny hopsage, and Thurber's needlegrass.  Some areas are mined for gravel.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Ada County, Idaho. MLRA 11. Ota soils are of small extent.
