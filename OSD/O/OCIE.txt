OCIE SERIES 

The Ocie series consists of deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in hillslope sediments and the underlying residuum from cherty dolomite or limestone with thin interbedded sandstone.  These soils are on upland saddles, benches, and sideslopes. Slopes range from 1 to 35 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 42 inches. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal over clayey, mixed, semiactive, mesic Oxyaquic Hapludalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON: Ocie gravelly silt loam - on an east-facing 7 percent slope in woodland at an elevation of 1,070 feet.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

   A--0 to 5 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak very fine granular structure; very friable; many medium roots; 20 percent chert gravel; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (1 to 7 inches thick) 

   E--5 to 11 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly silt loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; friable; many medium roots and pores; 15 percent chert gravel; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 22 inches thick) 

   Bt1--11 to 17 inches; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) and light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly silt loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine roots; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 50 percent chert gravel; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. 

   Bt2--17 to 24 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly clay loam; common fine prominent red (2.5YR 4/8) and yellowish red (5YR 5/8) mottles; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; common fine roots and pores; few faint clay films; 35 percent chert gravel and 5 percent cobbles of sandstone; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 4 to 20 inches.) 

   2Bt3--24 to 30 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) gravelly clay; common medium prominent light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) and few fine prominent red (2.5YR 4/8) mottles; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; many medium roots and pores; many faint clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent chert gravel; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary. 

   2Bt4--30 to 41 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) gravelly clay; few fine faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots and pores; many faint clay films on faces of peds; common dark stains (iron and manganese oxides); 15 percent chert gravel; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary. 

   2Bt5--41 to 56 inches; mixed yellowish brown (10YR 5/8), yellowish red (5YR 4/6), yellow (10YR 7/6) and reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8) clay; weak medium angular blocky structure; very firm; few medium roots and pores; few faint clay films; 10 percent chert and sandstone gravel; moderately acid; abrupt wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the 2Bt horizon is 20 to 42 inches.) 

   2R--56 inches; dolomite

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Mano series. Mano soils are deeper than 60 inches to bedrock.  Similar series are Bardley, Gatewood, and Goss.  Bardley and Gatewood soils are 20 to 40 inches over bedrock.  Goss soils are clayey-skeletal. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ocie soils are on low ridges and saddles, side and head slopes and benches.  Slope gradients are commonly 5 to 20 percent, but range from 1 to 35 percent.  The soils formed in hillslope sediments and the underlying residuum from cherty dolomite or limestone and interbedded sandstone.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 46 inches. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bardley, Clarksville, Coulstone, Gatewood, and Gasconade soils.  Bardley and Gatewood soils are in similar positions.  Clarksville and Coulstone soils are deeper and commonly on adjacent steeper side slopes but may be in similar positions.  Gasconade soils are shallow and in similar positions. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained.  Runoff potential is medium to very high.  Permeability is slow. A perched water table is in the 2Bt horizon for brief periods during late winter and early spring in most years.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in oak-hickory forest.  Some areas have been cleared and used for pasture.  Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Ozarks area (MLRAs 116A and 116B) of southern Missouri and possibly northern Arkansas.  The soil is extensive.
