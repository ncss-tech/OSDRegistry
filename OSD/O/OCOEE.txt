OCOEE SERIES


The Ocoee Series consists of deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in herbaceous organic material and sandy mineral material.  These soils are on floodplains, freshwater marshes, and depressions.  Slopes are less than 2 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy or sandy-skeletal, siliceous, dysic, hyperthermic Terric Haplohemists

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ocoee muck on a cultivated, drained and diked floodplain of Lake Minnehaha.

     Oap--0 to 7 inches; black (5YR 2/1) unrubbed and rubbed muck; about 30 percent fiber unrubbed, 10 percent fiber rubbed; moderate medium granular structure; friable; sodium pyrophosphate extract pale brown (10YR 6/3); extremely acid; clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 10 inches thick)

     Oa1--7 to 16 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) unrubbed, very dark gray (5YR 3/l) rubbed muck; 70 percent fiber unrubbed, 15 percent rubbed; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; sodium pyrophosphate extract brown (10YR 4/4); extremely acid; clear smooth boundary (0 to 9 inches thick)

     Oe1--16 to 32 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) unrubbed, (5YR 2/2) rubbed mucky peat; 85 percent fiber unrubbed, 35 percent rubbed; massive; very friable; sodium pyrophosphate extract light gray (10YR 7/2) and pale brown (10YR 6/3); extremely acid; gradual smooth boundary.

     Oe2--32 to 38 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) unrubbed, (5YR 2/2) rubbed mucky peat; 90 percent fiber unrubbed, 38 percent rubbed; massive; very friable; sodium pyrophosphate extract light gray (10YR 7/2); extremely acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (Thickness of the Oe extends to a depth of 16 to 40 inches)

     2Cg--38 to 60 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sand; single grained; loose medium acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lake County, Florida; 1.5 miles west of Clermont; 250 feet north of S.R. 50; SW 1/4, NE 1/4, Sec. 22, T.22S., R.25E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the sapric and hemic organic material is 16 to 40inches.  Reaction of the organic material ranges from extremely acid to very strongly acid; however, it is less than 4.4 in 0.01M calcium chloride in at least some part of the organic material.  Reaction of the underlying material ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid.

The Oa horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3; or it is neutral with value of 2.  Fiber content ranges from 20 to 90 percent unrubbed and less than 30 percent after rubbing.

The Oe horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4, or it is neutral with value of 2 t 4.  Fiber content ranges from 50 to 90 percent unrubbed and less than 40 percent rubbed.  Sodium pyrophosphate extract has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4.

The 2 Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, or it is neutral with value of 2.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to medium acid.

COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Brighton, Everglades, Micco, Okeechobee, Okeelanta, and Oklawaha series.  Brighton, Everglades, and Okeechobee soils have organic materials more than 51 inches thick.  In addition, Okeechobee soils are dominately sapric.  Okeelanta and Oklawaha soils have more clayey 2C horizons.  Micco soils are very similar but have loamy underlying material.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on floodplains, depressions, and freshwater marshes.  Near the type location, precipitation averages about 55 inches annually and the mean annual air temperature is about 74 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Brighton, Everglades, Micco, and Oklawaha series on the same landscape positions and Aquods on higher landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained.  Runoff is very slow.  Permeability is rapid to very rapid below the surface layer.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are drained and protected from flooding and used for truck crops, sod crops, and improved pasture.  Undrained areas are vegetated by sawgrass, reeds, lilies, Florida willow, and other aquatic non-woody and woody plants.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Ocoee soils are of small extent in Peninsular Florida.
