OCASHE SERIES

The Ocashe series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  Ocashe soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-skeletal, glassy, mesic Aridic Lithic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ocashe extremely gravelly ashy sandy loam--forest land. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is covered with 40 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones.

    A2--3 to 8 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely gravelly ashy sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; 60 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.7); clear wavy boundary.

(8 to 15 cm thick)

    Bt2--18 to 33 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly ashy sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; common faint clay bridges between sand grains; 65 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear irregular boundary.  (0 to 15 cm thick)

    R--33 cm; hard, fractured and altered volcanic rock.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Corbaley and Marepas series.

Corbaley soils have 10 to 30 percent coarse sand and very coarse sand-sized (0.5 to 2.0 mm in diameter) pumiceous ash grains and 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Marepas soils have 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ocashe are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks such as andesite and tuff with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,955 to 2,445 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 70 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Hardnut soil.  Hardnut soils have a frigid soil temperature regime and have lithic contacts at depths of 25 to 50 cm.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; very high surface runoff; moderate permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Ocashe soils are used for forest land, recreation, watershed, and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is mainly a forest canopy of singleleaf pinyon with an understory of mountain big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, and Thurber's needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern California and western Nevada, in the western part of the Great Basin.  These soils are not extensive.MLRA 26.
