OLDTRAIL SERIES 

The Oldtrail series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains and drainageways.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Oxyaquic Udifluvents 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Oldtrail gravelly sandy loam, in coniferous forest (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 4 inches, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak very fine granular structure; slighly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and common fine roots; 5 percent cobbles, 30 percent pebbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick) 

    C1--4 to 12 inches, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; single grain; loose; nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots; 20 percent cobbles and 50 percent pebbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (6 to 12 inches thick) 

    C2--12 to 25 inches, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) extremely cobbly loamy coarse sand, with thin strata of sand; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; single grain; loose; nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; 40 percent cobbles and 30 percent pebbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 15 inches thick) 

    C3--25 to 60 inches, stratified dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) extremely cobbly loamy coarse sand, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry, and very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; single grain; loose; nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; 40 percent cobbles and 30 percent pebbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6). 

TYPE LOCATION:  Sanders County, Montana; 100 feet north and 100 feet west of the center of sec. 33, T. 26 N., R. 33 W. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil temperature - 42 to 45 degrees F. 

Depth to seasonal high water table - 2 to 3.5 feet some time during the period from April to June. 

The surface layer will not meet the requirements of a mollic epipedon. 

The C3 horizon is stratified, but averages extremely cobbly.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 

Landform - floodplains and drainageways in steep narrow mountain valleys. 

Elevation - 2200 to 4200 feet. 

Slope - 0 to 8 percent. 

Parent material - alluvium. 

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers. 

Mean annual precipitation - 20 to 34 inches. 

Mean annual temperature - 42 to 45 degrees F. 

Frost-free period - 70 to 105 days. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Oldtrail soils are used mainly for watershed protection and wildlife habitat.  Potential native vegetation is mainly aspen, black cottonwood, Douglas-fir, Engelmann spruce, grand fir, mountain maple, serviceberry, thin-leaf alder, common snowberry, woods rose, western yarrow, oregon-grape, and elk sedge. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Oldtrail soils are of small extent in the valleys of northwestern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Sanders County, Montana 1997.

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretations Records:  MT1515.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches mixed (A, C1 horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (C1, C2, C3 horizons).  Oldtrail soils have a frigid temperature regime and a udic moisture regime.
