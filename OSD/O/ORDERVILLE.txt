ORDERVILLE SERIES

The Orderville series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and shale.  Orderville soils are on structural benches and hillslopes.  Slopes range from 15 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches (406 mm) and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F (8.3 degrees C).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Buffalo Park(KS) and Minqwet(CO). Buffalo Park soils have a lithologic discontinuity, loess parent material, and the soil forming factors of the Central High Tablelands, LRR H, MLRA 72. Minqwet soils are moderately deep to paralithic contact, calcium carbonate equivalent range of 15 to 40 percent, and the soil forming factors of the Central High Plains, LRR G, MLRA 67. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Orderville soils are on structural benches, hillslopes, and landslides at elevations of 5,300 to 7,560 feet (1910 to 2290 m). Slopes range from 15 to 35 percent. The soils formed in residuum and slope alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Mean annual precipitation ranges is 14 to 17 inches (355 to 432 mm) and mean annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F (7.2 to 10 degrees C). Frost-free period is 100 to 119 days. April, May, and June are driest months, with monsoonal pattern rainfall in late summer and light to moderate rainfall and snowfall in winter. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Flugle(NM), Naplene(UT), and Sideshow(CO) series.  The Flugle soils are on stable and slightly less sloping portions of structural benches and have an argillic horizon.  The Naplene soils are in swales on structural benches and do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons. The Sideshow soils occur on structural benches capped by fine textured alluvium and residuum from shale and are smectitic. These soils also have gypsum masses in the lower horizons. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: well drained, medium runoff, moderately high permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Orderville soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Vegetation includes Gambel oak, Utah serviceberry, Utah juniper, twoneedle pinyon, Indian ricegrass, big sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, and Sandberg bluegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Kane County, Utah; LRR D, MLRA 35; Orderville soils are of limited extent in southern Utah.

SERIES ESTABLISGED: Kane County, Utah, soil survey area July 2017  

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are

Particle-size control section:  the zone from 10 to 40 inches (25 to 100 cm)(Bw and Bk1 horizons)

Ochric epipedon: the zone from 0 to 3.5 inches (0 to 9 cm)(A horizons)

Cambic horizon:  the zone from 3.5 to 19 inches (9 to 48 cm)(Bw horizons) 

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

Orderville series are mapped in the vicinity of the town of Orderville, Utah.
