OVIATT SERIES

The Oviatt series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in a mixture of volcanic ash and material weathered from granite.  Oviatt soils are on mountains and have slopes of 35 to 75 percent.  They have moderate in the surface and rapid in the substratum permeability.  The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, frigid Dystric Eutrochrepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Oviatt loam, forested--on a 62 percent slope on a northeasterly aspect at an elevation of 2,000 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on August 1983, the profile was moist above 56 inches.)

    Oi--1 inch to 0; moss, leaves, needles, and twigs.

    A--0 to 8 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; many very fine, fine, and medium, few coarse roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 5 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 10 inches thick)

    Bs--8 to 13 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; slightly hard, friable; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 5 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to ll inches thick)

    2Bw--13 to 24 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky; common very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine and few fine tubular and interstitial pores; thin patchy clay films bridging sand grains; 5 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary.  (9 to 18 inches thick)

    2C1--24 to 30 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; common very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine and few fine interstitial pores; 5 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 9 inches thick)

    2C2--30 to 41 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; few very fine, common fine and medium roots; many very fine and few fine interstitial pores; 0.25 to 0.50 inch thick clay bands; 5 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.3); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 13 inches thick)

    2C3--41 to 56 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly loamy sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable; few fine and medium roots; 0.25 to 0.50 inch thick clay bands; 25 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.3); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 17 inches thick)

    2C4--56 to 70 inches; variegated sand; single grain; loose, loose; slightly acid (pH 6.3).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Linneus, Nehasne(T)(NY), and Pyrites(T) (NY).  The Linnus series has limestone bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Oviatt soils are on mountain slopes at elevations of 1,600 to 4,000 feet and have slopes of 35 to 75 percent.  These soils formed in a mixture of volcanic ash and material weathered from granite.   The average annual temperature varies from about 40 to 45 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation varies from about 30 to 35 inches and the frost free period is about 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Aldermand(T), Crumarine, Kauder(T), Spokane, and Uvi series.  Aldermand soils are on similar landscapes on concave positions and have volcanic ash mantles.  Crumarine soils are on bottomlands and are somewhat poorly drained.  Kauder soils are on undulating foothills and have a volcanic ash mantle and a fragipan.  Spokane soils are on south and west-facing convex slopes and have mesic soil temperature regimes.  Uvi soils are on similar landscapes and are fine-loamy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; runoff is very rapid; permeability is moderate in the surface and rapid in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used primarily for timber production, woodland grazing, wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed.  The natural vegetation is mainly western redcedar, grand fir, western larch, Douglas-fir, queencup beadlily, common prince's pine, longtube turnflower, western thimbleberry, and common snowberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Idaho.  Oviatt soils are not extensive.
