ONAWET SERIES

The Onawet series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in alluvium on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 740 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey over loamy, smectitic over mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Aeric Fluvaquents

TYPICAL PEDON: Onawet silty clay loam with a slope of nearly 0 percent on a nearly level flood plain; cultivated. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

  Ap--0 to 18 centimeters; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; friable; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (15 to 25 centimeters thick)

  Cg1--18 to 40 centimeters; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) silty clay, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) dry; moderate fine angular blocky structure; firm; common medium distinct dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) redox concentrations; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

  Cg2--40 to 61 centimeters; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) silty clay, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) dry; massive; firm; common medium distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) redox concentrations; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Cg horizons is 30 to 64 centimeters)

  2Cg3--61 to 81 centimeters; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) silt loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) dry and thin strata of light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) dry; massive; friable; common fine distinct reddish brown (5YR 4/4) redox concentrations; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

  2Cg4--81 to 99 centimeters; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) very fine sandy loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) dry and thin strata of light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) dry; massive; very friable; common fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redox concentrations; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

  2Cg5--99 to 142 centimeters; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) silt loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) dry; massive; friable; common fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redox concentrations; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

  3Cg6--142 to 203 centimeters; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) loamy fine sand, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) dry; massive; very friable; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redox concentrations; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Washington County, Nebraska, 2003. The named is coined.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon are:
Particle-size control section - 25 to 100 centimeters (Cg1, Cg2, 2Cg3, 2Cg4 horizons)
Ochric epipedon - 0 to 18 centimeters (Ap horizon)
Other features - strongly contrasting particle size classes within the control section.
Soil moisture regime: Aquic

Remarks: These soils were originally mapped as Rauville in the previous Washington County Nebraska soil survey. The Rauville soils are frigid.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
