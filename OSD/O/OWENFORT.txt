OWENFORT SERIES

The Owenfort series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium or outwash.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, inset fans and outwash fans.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Owenfort cobbly loam, rangeland on a 2 percent slope at 1,039 meters elevation (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A1--0 to 13 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) cobbly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; many fine irregular and tubular pores; 15 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual smooth boundary.  

    A2--13 to 25 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very cobbly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; many fine irregular and tubular pores; 20 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the A horizons - 25 to 40 cm)

    BC--25 to 61 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 45 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary. (30 to 85 cm thick)

    C1--61 to 107 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 45 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (13 to 51 cm thick)

    C2--107 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 55 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8).
