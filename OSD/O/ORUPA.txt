ORUPA SERIES

The Orupa series consists of very deep, well-drained soils that formed on parna dunes from windblown clay.  The Orupa soils are on bolson floors.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, calcareous, mesic Xeric Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Orupa clay loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

   A--0 to 10 cm; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) clay loam, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) moist; moderate medium platy structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 15 cm thick)

   C1--10 to 61 cm; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) clay loam, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) moist; strong very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary.  (23 to 100 cm thick)

   C2--61 to 152 cm; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) clay loam, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) moist; strong very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  White Pine County, Nevada; approximately 7 miles north of Dry Lake Well in Long Valley, about 1,900 feet north and 1,200 feet west of the southeast corner of section 30, T. 22 N., R. 59 E.; McBrides Sheep Well 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 44 minutes 50 seconds N and longitude 115 degrees 21 minutes 49 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.7472222 latitude, -115.3636111 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in winter and spring, dry summer and fall; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C.
Reaction:  Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.
Other features: Soil forms sand size aggregates which initially gives a texture of fine sandy loam.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  35 to 55 percent.

A horizon
Hue:  2.5Y or 10YR.
Value:  6 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.

C horizons
Hue:  2.5Y or 10YR.
Value:  6 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Texture:  Clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.
Clay content:  35 to 55 percent.
Structure:  Granular or subangular blocky.
Consistence: Soft or slightly hard dry.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Orupa soils are on parna dunes on and around lake plains.  These soils formed in wind deposited soil aggregates on bolson floors.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 1,710 to 2,020 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Sheffit and Uwell series. Sheffit soils have a linear extensibility of 6 cm or more within 100 cm. Uwell soils have fine-loamy particle-size control sections and have lacustrine sediments within 100 cm.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Livestock grazing, wildlife habitat and potential irrigated agriculture.  The present vegetation is mainly western wheatgrass, Wyoming big sagebrush, winterfat, Indian ricegrass, and rubber rabbitbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central Nevada.  These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28B.
