OAKZANITA SERIES

The Oakzanita series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from material weathering from gabbro and other igneous rocks. Oakzanita soils are on hillslopes and mountain slopes and have slopes of 5 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 720 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Mollic Haploxeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Oakzanita soils in an area of Oakzanita gravelly loam on a slope of 26 percent facing south at an elevation of 1480 meters under a cover of chamise, mountain mahogany, and buckwheat. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). The surface is covered by approximately 30 percent fine gravel and 15 percent medium gravel.

  A--0 to 22 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 4/2) gravelly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2), moist; moderate fine subangular block structure; very friable, slightly hard, moderately sticky, slightly plastic; common fine roots; common fine tubular and interstitial pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 24 cm thick)

 2Bt1--22 to 55 centimeters; red (2.5YR 4/6) clay loam, reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4), moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable, extremely hard, very sticky, very plastic; few very fine roots; common fine tubular pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (12 to 25 cm thick)

  2Bt2--55 to 73 centimeters; red (2.5YR 4/6) clay loam, red (2.5YR 4/6), moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; friable, extremely hard, very sticky, very plastic; very few fine roots; common fine and medium tubular pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (20 to 30 cm thick)

  2BCt--73 to 110 centimeters; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) clay loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6), moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable, extremely hard, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few very fine roots; few medium and many fine tubular pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; neutral (pH 7.0); clear gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 30 cm thick)

  2Cr--110 to 150 centimeters; moderately cemented gabbro-diorite rock
