ORYX SERIES

The Oryx series consists of very deep, well drained, soils that formed in calcareous alluvium.  Permeability is moderately slow .  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on inset fans of fan piedmonts.  Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent slopes. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, thermic Ustic Torrifluvents 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Oryx loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A--0 to 4 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; common fine to coarse roots in mat at top of horizon; fine low continuity vesicular pores; 11.0 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; strongly effervescent (HCl, 3 normal); moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 6 inches thick)

     2C1--4 to 37 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely gravelly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak very fine granular structure; common fine roots throughout; 14.0 percent calcium carbonate equivalent (<2mm fraction); 70 percent subrounded limestone gravel; strongly effervescent (HCl, 3 normal); moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (12 to 60 inches thick)

     3C2--37 to 55 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) silt loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak fine and medium angular blocky structure; common fine and medium roots throughout; common fine low continuity vesicular pores; 11.0 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; violently effervescent (HCl, 3 normal); moderately alkaline; diffuse smooth boundary. 

     3C3--55 to 80 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) silt loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak fine and medium angular blocky structure; common very fine roots throughout; common fine low continuity vesicular pores; 13.0 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; violently effervescent (HCl, 3 normal); moderately alkaline. 

TYPE LOCATION: Otero County, New Mexico; approximately 23.6 miles east and 4.3 miles north of Oro Grande; SW 1/4, SE 1/4 section 26, T.  21 S. , R. 12 E.  ; USGS El Paso Draw, NM topographic quadrangle; latitude 32 degrees 26 minutes 42 seconds north and longitude 105 degrees 41 minutes 17 seconds west. UTM zone 13, 435289E, 3589784N; NAD 27.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Oryx soils formed in alluvium from limestone on nearly level to gently sloping inset fans of fan piedmonts. Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 14 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 58 to 61 degrees F.  Frost-free days range from 140 to 180 and elevation ranges from 4,700 to 6,000 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Armesa, Jerag, Philder, Reyab, and Salado soils.  The Armesa, Jerag, Reyab, and Salado soils do not have a skeletal control section.  In addition, Jerag soils have petrocalcic horizons within 20 inches of the surface.  Philder soils have petrocalcic horizons within 20 inches of the surface.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained.  Permeability is moderately slow . Runoff is very low.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing.  Vegetation is mixed prairie consisting of blue grama, black grama, tobosa, sand dropseed, burrograss, creosotebush, mariola, desert holy, and silverleaf nightshade.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern New Mexico in MLRA 42. The series is of small extent.
