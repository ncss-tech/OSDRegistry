OSSIAN SERIES

The Ossian series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in silty alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains, low stream terraces, upland drainageways, and lake basins.  Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 850 millimeters.

USE AND VEGETATION:
Where drained, most areas are cultivated.  The principal crops are corn, soybeans, oats, and meadow.  Some areas are used for permanent pasture.  The native vegetation is big bluestem, western wheatgrass, sedges, blue grama and other species of the tall grass prairie that are tolerant of excessive wetness.

series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 203 centimeters (Ap, A, AB, Bg1, Bg2, Bg3, and BCg horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 58 centimeters (Ap, A, and AB horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 58 to 203 centimeters (Bg1, Bg2, Bg3, and BCg horizons).

Aquic suborder based on matrix color of mollic epipedon and aquic conditions in normal years within a depth of 50 centimeters.

Cation-exchange class is inferred from lab data for similar soils in the surrounding area.
