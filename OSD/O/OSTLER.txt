OSTLER SERIES

The Ostler series consists of deep well drained soils that formed in material weathered from tuffaceous sandstone, tuffaceous siltstone and tuffaceous limestone. These soils are on hillslopes of foothills. Slopes are 20 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Typic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ostler loam, rangeland.  (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Oe--0 to 3 cm; matted decaying leaves and twigs.

    A1--3 to 21 cm; black (10YR 2/1) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure that parts to weak fine granular; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine, medium and coarse roots; slightly acid (pH 6.1); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 45 cm thick)

    A2--21 to 49 cm; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure that parts to moderate fine and medium granular; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common fine, medium and coarse roots; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 30 cm thick)

    Bt1--49 to 59 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, sticky and very plastic; few fine, medium and coarse roots; common fine pores; common thin clay skins of peds; moderately acid (pH 5.8); gradual wavy boundary. 

    Bt2--59 to 74 cm, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) clay, light gray (2.5Y 7/2) dry; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, very firm, sticky and very plastic; few fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine pores; common thin clay films on faces of peds; moderately acid (pH 5.6); gradual irregular boundary.  (Combined thickness of Bt1 and Bt2 horizons - 25 to 95 cm)

    Bt3--74 to 97 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) heavy clay loam, light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, very firm, sticky and very plastic; few fine, medium and coarse roots; many fine and very fine pores; many thin clay films on faces of peds; moderately acid (pH 5.6); gradual irregular boundary.  (0 to 40 cm thick)

    Bt4--97 to 127 cm, brown (10YR 4/3) sandy clay loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; common, medium, distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) mottles; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, very firm, slightly sticky and very plastic; few fine and medium roots; many fine and very fine pores; few thin clay films on faces of peds; moderately acid (pH 5.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 55 cm thick)

    C--127 to 155 cm; crushed colors are light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) heavy clay loam, light gray (2.5Y 7/2) dry; 50 percent dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist and 50 percent pale olive (5Y 6/3) moist, aggregate color; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and plastic; few fine roots; many very fine and fine pores; moderately acid (pH 5.8)
