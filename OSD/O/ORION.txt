ORION SERIES

The Orion series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in 50 to 150 centimeters of recently deposited, stratified, alluvium overlying a buried soil. These soils are on flood plains, drainageways, and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 950 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, nonacid, mesic Aquic Udifluvents 

TYPICAL PEDON: Orion silt loam, on a 1 percent slope, in a cultivated area, at an elevation of about 270 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

 Ap--0 to 20 centimeters; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; common very fine to coarse roots; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (13 to 25 centimeters thick)

 C--20 to 81 centimeters; stratified brown (10YR 4/3) and dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam with thin strata of light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very fine sand; massive breaking to thick plates along depositional strata; friable; common very fine and fine roots; few medium prominent dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) masses of iron and few medium faint light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) iron depletions within the matrix; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. (25 to 125 centimeters thick) 

 Ab--81 to 100 centimeters; black (10YR 2/1) silt loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure breaking to very thick plates along depositional strata; friable; common medium distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions within the matrix; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. (12 to 80 centimeters thick)

 Cg--100 to 150 centimeters; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam; massive; friable; common coarse prominent yellowish red (5YR 5/6) masses of iron within the matrix; slightly acid.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--50 to 150 centimeters of recently deposited, stratified, alluvium overlying a buried soil
Landform--flood plains, drainageways and stream terraces
Slope--0 to 5 percent
Elevation--100 to 470 meters above sea level
Mean annual air temperature--4 to 14 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation--685 to 1,220 millimeters
Frost-free period--135 to 230 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Arenzville, Dorchester, Huntsville, and Lawson soils.
Arenzville--are on slightly higher landscape positions and have a frequently saturated zone at a depth of 1 meter during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Dorchester--are on slightly higher landscape positions, have a clay content that averages 18 to 24 percent in the particle-size control section, have carbonates in all parts between depths of 25 to 50 centimeters and have a frequently saturated zone at a depth of 1 meter during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Huntsville--are on slightly higher landscape positions on floodplains and have a mollic epipedon 60 to 145 centimeters thick
Lawson--are in landscape positions similar to those of Orion soils, have a mollic epipedon 60 to 90 centimeters thick, and have a frequently saturated zone at a depth of 0.3 meter during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--somewhat poorly drained--a frequently saturated zone occurs between depths of 0.3 to 0.75 meter during October to June in years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation and this saturation is considered apparent
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--1.00 to 10.00 micrometers per second
Flooding--rarely flooded to frequently flooded for very brief to brief periods during the months of February to November from precipitation events and snowmelt

Most areas are cultivated or pastured. Common crops are corn, small grain, and hay. Some areas are in woodland.
