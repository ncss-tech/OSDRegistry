OWENSPRING SERIES

The Owenspring series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium and slide deposits over residuum derived from interbedded sedimentary rock. These soils occur on hills, mountains, escarpments, structural benches, and landslides. Slopes range from 4 to 45 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Ustic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Owenspring loam, in rangeland on a 10 percent slope at an elevation of 2070 meters (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

 A--0 to 9 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 15 cm thick)

 Bt--9 to 26 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 20 percent distinct patchy clay films on faces of peds; 17 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary. (15 to 30 cm thick)

 Btk--26 to 51 cm; brown (10YR 5/3), clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine dendritic tubular pores; 20 percent distinct patchy clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent gravel; finely disseminated calcium carbonate and 10 percent fine and medium patchy soft masses and threads of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (15 to 30 cm thick)

 Bk--51 to 69 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3), paragravelly silty clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and very plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine dendritic tubular pores; 30 percent paragravel; finely disseminated calcium carbonate and 30 percent fine and medium patchy soft masses and threads of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. (15 to 60 cm thick)

 Cr--69 to 152 cm; semi-consolidated interbedded sedimentary rock.
