ORGTER SERIES

The Orgter series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in organic material over alluvium on terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 0.4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, isotic, dysic Terric Cryohemists

TYPICAL PEDON: Orgter peat, located on a stream terrace with a slope of 1 percent and elevation of 42 meters; when described on August 12th, 2010 the soil was wet throughout (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted)

 Oi--0 to 8 cm; peat; nonsticky, nonplastic; many fine roots, common medium roots, and common very fine roots; extremely acid (pH 4.1); gradual smooth boundary

 Oe--8 to 95 cm; mucky peat; nonsticky, nonplastic; many fine roots, common medium roots, and many very fine roots; extremely acid (pH 4.1); gradual smooth boundary

 A--95 to 115 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) stratified mucky silt loam; 40 percent sand; 55 percent silt; 5 percent clay; weak medium granular structure; friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine roots; 1 percent gravel; very strongly acid (pH 4.7); clear smooth boundary

 ACg--115 to 183 cm; very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) stratified sandy loam; 60 percent sand; 35 percent silt; 5 percent clay; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; nonsticky, nonplastic; very strongly acid (pH 4.8)
