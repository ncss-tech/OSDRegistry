OBARO SERIES

The Obaro series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in residuum of weakly consolidated, noncemented, fine-grained calcareous sandstone of the Quartermaster Formation and Whitehorse group of Permian age. These soils occur on very gently sloping to moderately steep interfluves and side slopes of hillslopes, knolls, and ridges in the Central Rolling Red Plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 559 mm (22 in) and mean annual air temperature is 16.1 degrees C (61 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Obaro loam, on east-facing, convex, 2 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of about 646 m (2,120 feet).
