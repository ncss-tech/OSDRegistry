OWENS SERIES

The Owens series consists of shallow to moderately deep over claystone bedrock  or dense clay well drained, very slowly Permeable soils that formed in residuum from claystone bedrock. These soils are on gently sloping to steep escarpments and plains. Slopes range from 1 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is very slow. Runoff is very high.

USE AND VEGETATION: The principal use is for rangeland. Small acreage has been cultivated in the past but most cultivated areas are now abandoned and returned to rangeland. Native vegetation is mainly sideoats grama, silver bluestem, buffalograss, vine-mesquite, curlymesquite, Texas needlegrass, Arizona cottontop, hairy triden, bundleflower, engelmanndaisy, western ragweed, algerita, and lotebush. Tasajillo and mesquite have invaded in most areas.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Texas North-Central Prairies (MLRA 80B), and Rolling Limestone Prairie (MLRA 78A) of Texas.  The Owens Series is extensive.
