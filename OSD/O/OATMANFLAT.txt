OATMANFLAT SERIES

The Oatmanflat series consists of deep to a buried duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic ash and basalt. Oatmanflat soils are on low stream terraces and in swales on lava plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Boltz, Bonnick, Borobey, Emamount, Embal, Frentera, Gardone, Picturerock, Stookmoor, Tuffcabin, and Wegert series. 

Boltz soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts. Bonnick, Borobey, Emamount, Embal, Gardone, and Picturerock soils do not have buried argillic horizons within 100 cm and buried duripans within 150 cm of the soil surface. Tuffcabin soils are drier and have free carbonates, sodium adsorption ratio of 5 to 13, and pH up to 9.6 within 100 cm of the soil surface. Frentera, Stookmoor, and Wegert soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Oatmanflat soils are on low stream terraces and in swales on lava plateaus. These soils formed in alluvium derived from volcanic ash and basalt. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Elevations range from 1,345 to 1,555 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 40 to 80 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Borobey soil and the Silverash soil. Silverash soils are fine, have ochric epipedons, argillic horizons with an abrupt textural change, and occur on adjacent depressions. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very low surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. These soils are susceptible to rare flooding for very brief periods between January and May.  One phase is recognized that is not subject to flooding.

USE AND VEGETATION: Oatmanflat soils are used for livestock grazing. The vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, basin big sagebrush, Idaho fescue, Thurber's needlegrass, and Ross's sedge. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Oregon. These soils are not extensive with about 3,900 acres of the series mapped to date. MLRA 23.
