OVERFELT SERIES

The Overfelt series consists of very deep, well drained 	soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on alluvial 	fans and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Mean 	annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual 	temperature is about 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey over loamy-skeletal, smectitic over mixed, superactive, frigid Vertic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Overfelt gravelly loam, grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 8 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and few medium roots; many very fine and fine pores; 2 percent pebbles, 3 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 12 inches thick)

    Bt1--8 to 16 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) clay, dark brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium subangular blocky; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine roots; common fine and very fine pores; common pressure faces and cracks 1/4 to 1/2 inches wide; continuous distinct clay films in pores and on faces of peds; 5 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. 

    Bt2--16 to 27 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) clay, dark brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium subangular blocky; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine roots; common fine and very fine pores; common pressure faces and cracks 1/4 to 1/2 inches wide; continuous distinct clay films in pores and on faces of peds; 5 percent pebbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of Bt horizon is 15 to 24 inches)

    2Bk1--27 to 42 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common fine and medium pores; 35 percent pebbles; 15 percent cobbles; 5 percent stones; many distinct carbonate coats on lower surfaces of coarse fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual smooth boundary. (10 to 24 inches thick)

    3Bk2--42 to 61 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly coarse sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 35 percent pebbles, 15 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; few faint carbonate coats on lower surfaces of coarse fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 8 inches (A horizon); an argillic horizon from 8 to 27 inches (Bt horizons); horizons of calcium carbonate accumulation from 27 to 61 inches (2Bk1, 3Bk2 horizons); a lithologic discontinuity at 27 inches (2Bk1 horizon); and a particle-size control section from 8 to 40 inches (Bt1, Bt2, 2Bk1 horizons). Overfelt soils have an ustic moisture regime and a frigid temperature regime.
