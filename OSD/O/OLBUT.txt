SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Salina, Kansas 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Butler County, Nebraska, 1979.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 36 centimeters (0 to 14 inches) (Ap and Bt horizons); 
Argillic horizon: 15 to 51 centimeters (6 to 20 inches) (Bt and Btz horizons);
Salt accumulations: 36 to 200 centimeters (14 to 80 inches) (Btz, BCz, and Cz horizons) 
Aquic soil conditions: 51 to 203 (20 to 80 inches) (BCz, Cz1 and Cz2 horizons).
Vertic features: The presence of a linear extensibility of 6.0 cm or more between 0 and 100 centimeters (0 to 40 inches). This is based on lab data of similar soils with similar clay contents in the area. 

These soils have been previously recognized as an alkali phase of Butler soils. 

11/2005 JCR and LM Changed to semi-tab format, added metric conversion and saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Also, added z subscript to B horizons based on the two NSSL samples.

OSD Modification 2/2012 DJK 
Edited climate data in introduction and geomorphic setting to fit series extent.
Changed classification from Abruptic Argiaquolls to Vertic Argiaquolls because vertic falls out before abruptic in Keys to Soil Taxonomy.
Added elevation to typical pedon.
Added the z horizon suffix to the horizons in the typical pedon that describe salt accumulations.
In RIC edited mollic thickness, added depth to argillic, added depth to salt, added depth to episaturation, and PSCS info. For horizons added clay, sand, EC, and SAR. Also populated redox using pedon data and added 3 to value for Ap and Bt horizons. Deleted silt loam as possible texture for BCz. 
Edited Competing Series section to fit new classification.
Added saturation statement to Drainage and Ksat section.
Added soybeans and edited native vegetation statement in Use and Veg.
Added LRRs and MLRAs to Distribution and Extent.
Added in salt accumulation depths to Remarks section.
Added Additional Data section with NSSL characterization data.

OSD Modification 8/2012 DJK Added soil moisture and temperature to RIC. Lowered sand content for the Ap from 7 to 4 percent. Lowered the sand content for the Bt and Btz horizons from 4 to 2 percent. Increased lower clay content for Bt and PSCS from 40 to 42. Increased the sand content for the Cz from 8 to 10. Added calcium carbonate equivalent to RIC. Updated competing series. Added precipitation pattern to geographic setting. Added linear extensibility to remarks.

11/2021 PTC: Added wetland vegetation for Nebraska to ADDITIONAL DATA.  Added Thickness to Range in Characteristics.

ADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL characterization data available for pedons 79NE059006 and 79NE059010.  

In Nebraska, the native vegetative cover is an herbaceous wetland community commonly inhabited with: shortbeak sedge (Carex brevior (Dewey) Mack.), woolly sedge (Carex pellita), ticklegrass(Agrostis hyemalis), bald spikerush (Eleocharis erythropoda), western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii), and rice cutgrass (Leersia oryzoides). Plains coreopsis (Coreopsis tinctoria), western water clover, (Marsilea vestita), smartweeds (Persicaria spp.), docks (Rumex spp.), and prairie ironweed (Vernonia fasciculata).
