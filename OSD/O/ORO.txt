ORO SERIES

The Oro series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from shale and sandstone.  The Oro soils are on fan remnants and low stream terraces.  Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent;  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey over loamy, smectitic over mixed, superactive, mesic Ustertic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Oro silty clay loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     A--0 to 2 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky,  and slightly plastic, common very fine roots; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 4 inches thick)

     Bt1--2 to 8 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) clay, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic parting to strong fine angular blocky structure;  hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine roots; common distinct thick clay films on faces of peds; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 12 inches thick)

     Btss2--8 to 25 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) clay, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; strong medium angular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very  fine roots; common slickensides and wedge shaped aggregates; common moderately thick clay films on faces of peds; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 25 inches thick)

     2Bt3--25 to 33 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) clay, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium and fine angular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky, and plastic; few  very fine roots; common faint clay film on faces of peds; very slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); clear smooth boundary.

     2Bk--33 to 39 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, sticky, and plastic; few very fine tubular pores; common fine soft masses of secondary calcium carbonates; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); clear smooth boundary.

    2C--39 to 80 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grain; loose; loose, nonsticky, and nonplastic; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9).

Clay content: 35 to 50 percent, in the upper part; 5 to 25 percent in the lower part

Rock fragments:  0 to 10 percent, mainly pebbles

Depth to strongly contrasting layer: 15 to 35 inches.

Cracks are greater than 5mm wide throughout a thickness of 12 inches for some time in normal years.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no competing series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Oro soils are on planar positions of fans and fan remnants.   Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The soils formed in alluvium from sedimentary rock with some addition of eolian material.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 53 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 13 inches, with a marked summer maximum characterized by heavy thunderstorms of short duration.  In a few areas the precipitation is higher. The frost-free season ranges from 115 to 160 days and elevation of ranges from 6,500 to 7,200 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Doakum, Starlake, and Royosa soils.  Doakum soils have less than 35 percent clay in the control section. Starlake soils have natric horizons.  Royosa soils lack argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is slow.  Runoff is negligible on slopes less than 1 percent, very low on 1 to 3 percent slopes, low on 3 to 5 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The principal use of these soils is grazing.  Present vegetation is big sagebrush, blue grama, galleta, and threeawn.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central New Mexico, MLRA 36.  This soil is of small extent.
