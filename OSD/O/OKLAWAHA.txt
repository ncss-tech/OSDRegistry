OKLAWAHA SERIES

The Oklawaha series consists of deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in herbaceous organic material and loamy and clayey mineral material.  These soils are on floodplain, freshwater marshes, and depressions.  Slopes are less than 2 percent.
TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, mixed, euic, hyperthermic Terric Haplohemists

TYPICAL PEDON:  Oklawaha muck on a cultivated floodplain north of Lake Apopka.

     Oap--0 to 9 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) unrubbed and rubbed muck; sapric material; about 30 percent fiber unrubbed, about 5 percent fiber rubbed; weak fine granular structure; friable; sodium pyrophosphate extract pale brown (10YR 6/3); slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (7 to 12 inches thick)

     Oe1--9 to 15 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) unrubbed, (5YR 2/2) rubbed mucky peat; 70 percent fiber unrubbed, 30 percent rubbed; massive; very friable; sodium pyrophosphate extract light gray (10YR 7/2) and pale brown (10YR 6/3); slightly acid; smooth boundary.

     Oe2--15 to 25 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) unrubbed, (5YR 2/2) rubbed mucky peat; 90 percent fiber unrubbed, 40 percent rubbed; massive; very friable; sodium pyrophosphate extract light gray (10YR 7/2); slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (Thickness of the Oe extends to a depth of 16 to 40 inches)

     2Cg--25 to 31 inches; black (10YR 2/1) sandy loam; weak fine granular structure; friable; neutral abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 8 inches thick)

     3Cg1--31 to 37 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) sandy clay; few fine light gray snail fragments and white calcium carbonate nodules and streaks; massive very sticky and firm; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.

     3Cg2--37 to 60 inches; white (10YR 8/2) clay; few fine faint dark gray and very dark gray streaks and mottles; massive; firm and very sticky; common fine shell fragments and calcium carbonate nodules (10 percent by volume); moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lake County, Florida; floodplain between Lake Apopka and Lake Dora.  Site is l/4 mile north of Duda and Sons processing plant; 200 feet west of road and 100 feet north of drainage ditch; NE 1/4, SW 1/4, Sec. 36, T.20S., R.26E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the sapric and hemic organic material is 16 to 40 inches.  Reaction of the organic material ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  Reaction is more than 4.5 in. 0.0lM calcium chloride in all parts of the organic material.  Reaction of the underlying material ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.

The Oa horizon has hue of 5YR to l0YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of l to 3; or it is neutral with value of 2.  Fiber content ranges from 20 to 90 percent unrubbed and less than 30 percent after rubbing.

The Oe horizon has hue of 5YR to l0YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4; or it is neutral with value of 2 to 4; or it is neutral with value of 2 to 4.  Fiber content is dominantly 50 to 90 percent unrubbed and less than 40 percent rubbed.  Texture is dominantly mucky peat.  However thin, less than l0 inches, layers may be either sapric (muck) or fibric (peat).

The 2Cg horizon, where present, has hue of l0YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of l or 2; or it is neutral with value of 2 to 4.  Texture is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy clay.
The 3 Cg horizon has hue of l0YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of l or 2; or it is neutral with value of 2 to 4.  Texture is sandy clay or clay.  Fragments, less than 3 inches in size, of shell, snails, and secondary calcium carbonate accumulations, range up to l0 percent by volume.

COMPETING SERIES:  These include Brighton, Everglades, Micco, Ocoee, Okeechobee, and Okeelanta series.  Brighton, Everglades, and Okeechobee soils have organic materials more than 5l inches thick.  In addition, Okeechobee and Okeelanta soils are very similar but have a loamy underlying material.  Ocoee soils have a loamy underlying material.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on flood plains, depressions, and freshwater marshes.  Near the type location, precipitation averages about 55 inches annually and the mean annual air temperature is about 73 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Brighton, Everglades, Micco, and Ocoee series on the same landscape positions and Aquods on higher landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained, runoff is very slow.  Permeability is slow.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are in natural vegetation of sawgrass, lilies, sedges, cypress, bay, maple, and blackgum and used for range, wildlife habitat, or water storage areas.  Some areas are drained and diked.  These areas are used for truck crops, bulb crops, sod crops, and improved pasture.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Oklawaha soils are of moderate extent in Peninsular Florida.
