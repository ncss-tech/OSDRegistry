OLDGRADE SERIES


The Oldgrade series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from volcanic rocks such as andesite, with additions of eolian volcanic ash.  Oldgrade soils are on mountains and plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

Adamatt soils have bedrock within 50 cm and have more than 35 percent rock fragments in their particle-size control section.  Bodiehill soils have more than 60 percent rock fragments in their particle-size control section, and have a frigid soil temperature regime.  Lastsummer soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in their particle-size control section, and have a mollic epipedon more than 50 cm thick.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained; Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 1 and 100 cm (moderately deep free water occurrence classes) during spring months in some years. Cumulative annual duration class is Transitory; low surface runoff; moderate permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Oldgrade soils are used for livestock grazing, recreation, watershed and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is mainly silver sagebrush, sedge, western needlegrass, mat muhly, and lupine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern California, east of the Sierra Nevada Range. These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 26.
