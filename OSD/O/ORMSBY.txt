ORMSBY SERIES

The Ormsby series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from granitic rocks.  Ormsby soils are on low stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Frewa series. Frewa soils have loamy sand or loamy fine sand particle-size control sections.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ormsby soils are on low stream terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from granitic rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations range from 1,400 to 1,465 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dangberg and Ophir soils.  Dangberg soils are fine, moderately deep to duripans, and have natric horizons.  Ophir soils are sandy, have mollic epipedons, and are usually saturated to the surface during late winter and spring.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained; very low surface runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 8 and 13 cm (moderately deep and deep free water occurrence classes) from December through May.  Cumulative annual duration classes are Common or Persistent.  These soils are susceptible to rare flooding for very brief periods year-round.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Ormsby soils are used for irrigated cropland, urban development, and livestock grazing.  The main crops are alfalfa for hay, grass-legume hay, and small grains.  The vegetation in rangeland is basin big sagebrush, rubber rabbitbrush, Indian ricegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Nevada and northeastern California.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 26.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Douglas County, Nevada, 1973.

REMARKS:  This revision updates the taxonomic subgroup from Aquic Durinodic Xeropsamments to Haploduridic Torripsamments.  The Ormsby soils mapped in the soil survey of Sierra Valley Area, California, have mollic epipedons and lack the duric feature, and need correlation in the future to another soil series.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (Ap horizon).
Duric feature - The zone from 60 to 112 cm (Cq1 and Cq2 horizons).
Endosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 91 and 152 cm at certain times during normal years (parts of the Cq2, Cq3, and C' horizons).
Particle size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (C and Cq1 horizons and parts of the A and Cq2 horizons).

ADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location was sampled in 1959 and characterized by the soil survey laboratory in Riverside, CA as sample number S59Nev-3-7.  A separate adjacent pedon was also characterized as sample number S59Nev-3-8.  Data for both pedons is published in SSIR No. 23 (pages 146-149).
