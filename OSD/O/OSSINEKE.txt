OSSINEKE SERIES

The Ossineke series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy basal till on ground moraines, disintegration moraines, and drumlins. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, semiactive, frigid Oxyaquic Glossudalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Ossineke fine sandy loam, on a northwest-facing, concave, 2 percent slope in a hayfield at an elevation of about 244 meters (800 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated. When described on June 9, 1994 the soil was moist throughout.)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Ossineke soils are on ground moraines, drumlins, and disintegration moraines of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. These soils formed in fractured till that is underlain by coarse textured stratified glaciofluvium at varying depths. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 813 mm (27 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 to 7.2 degrees C (43 to 45 degrees F). Frost-free period is 100 to 140 days. Elevation is 183 to 305 meters (600 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bamfield, Slade, and Angelica soils. Bamfield soils are well drained and are on slopes greater than 12 percent. Slade soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on lower positions on the landscape. Angelica soils are poorly drained or very poorly drained, do not have an argillic horizon, and are in depressions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. Potential for surface runoff is low to high depending on slope gradients. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low. Permeability is slow. Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 46 to 107 cm (1.5 to 3.5 feet) between October and May in normal years.

USE AND VEGETATION: A major portion of the soil is cropland. Grass hay, alfalfa, oats, and corn are the principal crops. Tree species in forested areas include sugar maple, northern red oak, American basswood, bigtooth aspen, paper birch, American beech, and white ash. Bigleaf aster, Canada mayflower, and downy yellow violet are common understory plants.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 94A and 96 in the northeast quarter of the lower peninsula of Michigan. This series is of moderate extent.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 25 cm (10 inches) (Ap horizon). 
Glossic horizon: from a depth of 38 to 56 cm (15 to 22 inches) (E/B horizon).
