OLENO SERIES

The Oleno series consists of poorly drained, slowly permeable
soils that formed in clayey fluvial sediments over loamy deposits
on the flood plains of the coastal plains.  These soils are on
nearly level flood plains immediately adjacent to streams, creeks, and rivers.  Slopes are less than 2 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey over loamy, smectitic, acid, thermic Vertic Endoaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Oleno clay in a wooded area.
(Colors are for moist soil.)

A1--0 to 6 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay, common fine
faint black (10YR 2/1) and few fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) mottles; massive; very firm, sticky and plastic; common fine
and medium roots; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (4 to
10 inches thick)

B21g--6 to 24 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) clay; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very firm, sticky and plastic; common fine and medium roots; extremely acid; clear wavy boundary.

B22g--24 to 32 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) clay; common medium
faint dark gray (10YR 4/1) mottles; moderate medium subangular
blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; extremely acid; clear
wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the B horizon is 22 to 33 inches.)

IIA21--32 to 42 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy
loam; many fine faint light gray mottles; weak fine granular structure; very friable; few fine roots; strongly acid; gradual
wavy boundary.

IIA22--42 to 55 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) fine sandy loam (sand
and sandy clay loam lenses before mixing); weak medium granular structure; very friable; few fine roots; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (Combined  thickness of the IIA horizon is 18 to 30 inches.)

IIB1g--55 to 71 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) fine sandy loam;
many medium faint gray (10YR 6/1) and light brownish gray (10YR
6/2) mottles; moderate medium granular structure; friable; few
small pockets of sandy clay loam; medium acid; clear wavy
boundary.

IIB2g--71 to 77 inches; gray (5Y 6/1) sandy clay loam; common
medium distinct brownish yellow (10YR 6/6), common large faint
light gray (10YR 7/1), and few medium distinct greenish gray (5GY 6/1) mottles; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; slightly acid; abrupt wavy boundary.  (Total thickness of the IIBg horizons is 18 to 25 inches.)

IIICg--77 to 82 inches; greenish gray (5 BG 6/1) clay;
massive; very firm; sticky, plastic; few fine and medium light
gray nodules and shell fragments; neutral.

TYPE LOCATION:  Columbia County, Florida; about 2 miles east of junction of Oak Ridge Road and U.S. Hwy. 441 SW1/4SE1/4, Sec. 11,
T. 75. R. 17 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 66 to more than 80 inches.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR or neutral, value of 2 to 5, chroma
of 1.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to medium acid.
Texture is clay.

The B horizons have hue of 10YR or neutral, value of 2 to 6,
chroma of 1.  Dark gray mottles range from none to many in the
lower part.  Soil reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid.  Texture is clay.  Vertical streaks of dark gray colored surface materials are present when the soil is moist.  These areas are cracks when the soil is dry.

The IIA2 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 7, chroma of 1 or
2.  Light gray mottles range from none to many.  Fresh water shell deposits are in this horizon in some pedons.  Soil reaction ranges from very strongly acid to mildly alkaline.  Texture is sand,
loamy sand, or fine sandy loam, and some small pockets of sandy
clay loam.

The IIB horizons have hue of 10YR or 5Y, value of 3 through 7,
chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles in shades of yellow, brown, or gray
range from few to many.  Texture of the IIB1g horizon is sandy
loam or fine sandy loam.  The IIB2g horizon is sandy clay loam or sandy clay.  The clay content of the IIB2g horizon ranges from 22
to 40 percent.

The IIICg horizon, where present, has hue of 5BG or 5B, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1.  Texture is sandy clay or clay.  Shell fragments range from none to many.  Reaction ranges from medium
acid to mildly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are Apalachee, Earle, Newellton, and Turnbull series .  Apalachee soils are clayey throughout the
solum.  Earle soils are somewhat poorly drained and have finer textured substrata.  Newellton and Turnbull soils are nonacid.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Oleno soils are on nearly level flood plains subject to occasional flooding for long periods of time.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation near the
type location is about 57 inches and mean annual air temperature
is about 69 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Bigbee, Chipley, and Chiefland series.  All of these soils lack clayey surface
horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Oleno soils are poorly drained.  They
are occasionally flooded for long periods.  The water table is between depths of 6 to 18 inches for 6 or 7 months; it is below 18 inches the remainder of the year.  Permeability is slow in the A
and B horizons and moderate throughout the rest of the pedon.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are in native vegetation.  A few small areas are used for recreational development.  The native vegetation is black tupelo, cypress, sweetgum, dwarf palmetto, red maple, sweetbay magnolia and water hickory.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Flood plains of rivers in north Florida.  This series is of small known extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Columbia County, Florida, 1981.

REMARKS:  This soil was moist when described so no cracks were observed.  However, there were vertical streaks of dark gray
colored surface materials in the B21g horizon.
