ORMISTON SERIES

The Ormiston series consists of deep to sandstone, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium from eolian material, and colluvium and residuum from sandstone.  Ormiston soils are on hills and mesas.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, frigid Calcic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ormiston extremely stony loam, in rangeland   (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  

    The surface is covered by 10 percent stones from sandstone.

    A1--0 to 3 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) extremely stony loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak thick platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 20 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, and 25 percent stones from sandstone; neutral; clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick) 

    A2--3 to 7 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very stony clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; 10 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles, and 20 percent stones from sandstone; neutral, clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 7 inches thick) 

    Bt1--7 to 24 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) very stony clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; strong medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium angular blocky; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many distinct clay films on the faces of peds; 10 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, and 20 percent stones from sandstone; slightly alkaline; clear irregular boundary.  (15 to 20 inches thick) 

    Bt2--24 to 32 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) stony clay loam, yellowish red (5YR 5/6) moist; strong medium angular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many distinct clay films on the faces of peds; 5 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones from sandstone; slightly alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 20 inches thick) 

    Bk--32 to 44 inches; pinkish white (5YR 8/2) stony clay loam, pink (5YR 7/3) moist; massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many large masses of calcium carbonate; 5 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stone from sandstone; violently effervescent, 33 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 15 inches thick) 

    2R--44 inches; hard Dakota sandstone.

A horizon:
Hue:  5YR to 10YR
Value:  3 to 5 dry, 2 to 4 moist
Chroma:  2 to 4 dry or moist
Rock fragments:  35 to 80 percent sandstone fragments, mostly stones with lesser amounts of cobble and gravel
Reaction:  neutral or slightly alkaline

Bt horizon:
Hue:  2.5YR to 7.5YR
Value:  4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  Similar soils are the Ceek, Fishers, and Pleioville soils.  These soils lack calcic horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium and colluvium from eolian material, and colluvium and residuum from sandstone
Landform:  hills and mesas
Slopes:  0 to 30 percent
Elevation: 7,100 to 8,600 feet
Mean annual temperature:  40 to 45 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation:  15 to 25 inches
Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year with July and August being slightly wetter and June being slightly dryer.
Frost-free period:  75 to 110 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Granath, and Nortez soils on similar positions.  These soils all have non-skeletal particle size control sections and mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  well drained, medium to very high runoff, slow permeability  

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for grazing and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is Gambel's oak, Utah serviceberry, mountain brome, elk sedge, and junegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwest Colorado.  LRR E, MLRA 48A.  This series is of small extent.
