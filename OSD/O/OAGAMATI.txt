OAGAMATI SERIES

The Oagamati series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from Mancos Shale.  Oagamati soils are on pediments.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.
