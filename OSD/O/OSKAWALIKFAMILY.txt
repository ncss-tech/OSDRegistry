COMPETING SERIES: These are no series in this family.  When a series is established, this series placeholder will be dropped (see REMARKS).
 
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loess and alluvium
Landform: toeslopes of hills, and floodplains 
Slope: 0 to 9 percent
Mean annual temperature: 28 to 30 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 15 to 18 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Typic Cryaquents and Aquic Cryofluvents on similar landforms. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly to poorly drained. Low to medium runoff. Permeability is moderate.
 
USE AND VEGETATION: Used for subsistence and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is typical of Boreal scrub.

SERIES PROPOSED: The Western Interior Rivers Area, Alaska, 2007

REMARKS: This series is set-up as a placeholder to allow the use of a short family name.  The range in characteristics is broader than a typical series and may even encompass the full range of the family.  There are currently no series designated in this soil family.

Diagnostic features and horizons recognized in this profile include:
Mineral horizons: from 2 to 59 inches.
Temperature regime: Cryic
Moisture regime: Aquic
Irregular carbon decrease: 2 to 59 inches 
Redox features: 11 to 59 inches
