ORDEAL SERIES

The Ordeal series consists of moderately deep to soft bedrock, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from fanglomerate or sandstone. The Ordeal soils are on hills. Slopes range from 20 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches (432 millimeters) and the mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F (16 degrees C).

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Sandy-skeletal, mixed, thermic Entic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ordeal loamy sand on a southeast facing hill with 40 percent slope under a cover of chamise and annual grasses at an elevation of 1,660 feet (506 meters). When described on 01/19/2005 the soil was moist from 0 to 7 inches (0 to 19 cm). Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.

	A1--0 to 6 inches (0 to 15 centimeters); brown (10YR 5/3), loamy sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary.

	A2--6 to 14 inches (15 to 35 centimeters); brown (10YR 5/3), loamy sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizons is 8 to 14 inches, 21 to 35 centimeters)

	C1--14 to 23 inches (35 to 58 centimeters); pale brown (10YR 6/3), gravelly loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 30 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.

	C2--23 to 36 inches (58 to 92 centimeters); pale brown (10YR 6/3), extremely gravelly loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; 35 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the C horizons is 6 to 22 inches, 14 to 57 centimeters)

	Cr--36 to 40 inches (92 to 102 centimeters); moderately cemented fanglomerate bedrock, fractured at intervals of <4 inches (10 centimeters).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Baywood, Gorgonio, Kelval, Timor and Tinnin soils.  The Baywood, Gorgonio, Kelval and Tinnin are all deeper than 60 inches (150 centimeters) to bedrock.  The Timor soil is 40 to 60 inches (100 to 150 centimeters) deep to a duripan.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ordeal soils are on backslopes of hills. Slopes range from 20 to 75 percent. These soils formed in residuum weathered from fanglomerate derived from granite or sandstone. Elevation ranges from 980 to 2,300 feet (300 to 700 meters). The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 17 to 19 inches (432 to 483 millimeters). The mean annual temperature is about 59 to 63 degrees F (15 to 17 degrees C). Frost free season is 190 to 210 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Longsfolly, Passion and Tuborcio soils. The Longsfolly soils are deep to paralithic bedrock on mostly north-facing backslopes of hills under wedgeleaf ceanothus and chamise.  The Passion soils are shallow to paralithic bedrock on shoulders of hills under chamise.  The Tuborcio soils have a fine textured argillic horizon and are on backslopes of hills under blue oak savannah.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; medium or high runoff; rapid permeability. These soils do not flood or pond.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for watershed, wildlife habitat and recreation. Vegetation is Chamise chaparral.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: San Benito County, California in MLRA 15  Central California Coast Range. These soils are of small extent.
