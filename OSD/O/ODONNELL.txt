ODONNELL SERIES

The Odonnell series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on hillslopes, benches and relict stream terraces. They formed in mixed materials consisting of loess, colluvium and alluvium derived from anorthosite, schist, and gneiss bedrock with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. Some pedons may contain residuum from these rocks in the lower portion of the profile. Slope ranges from 10 to 40 percent. The average annual air temperature is about 6.1 degrees C and average annual precipitation is about 1,525 mm.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Floodwood, Garveson, and Keeler soils. Floodwood soils are on north, east and west-facing convex slopes of foothills and mountains, and are well drained. Keeler soils are on south-facing concave slopes of foothills and mountains, and are well drained and do not have a volcanic ash mantle. Garveson soils are on north, east, and west-facing convex slopes of canyonsides, and are ashy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and do not have argillic horizons. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained; rapid to very rapid runoff; slow saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, recreation, watershed, and wildlife habitat. Potential natural vegetation is mainly western redcedar, western white pine, grand fir, Douglas-fir, and western larch, with an understory of common ladyfern, queencup beadlily, wild ginger, starry false-Solomons-seal, American trailplant, sweet-scented bedstraw, oneleaf foamflower, longtube twinflower, piper anemone, Oregon fairybells, and oakfern. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Idaho. This soil is not extensive. MLRA 43A.
