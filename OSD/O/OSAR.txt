COMPETING SERIES: This is the Disappoint series. Disappoint series have a mean presumed annual soil temperature greater than 35 degrees F. (1.5 degrees C.).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: silty eolian deposits over gravelly alluvium
Elevation: 2,667 to 2,930 feet (813 to 893 m)
Slope: 12 to 35 percent
Annual precipitation: 31 to 35 inches (776 to 886 mm)
Annual temperature: 25 degrees F (-4 degrees C)
Frost-free period: 60 to 80 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Klute and Sonderna soils. Klute soils are well drained, very deep, and occur on flood plains and alluvial fans. Sonderna soils are well drained, very deep, and occur on terraces and alluvial fans.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained, very high runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat and recreation. Native vegetation is white spruce/willow woodland, wet.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 228, Interior Alaska Mountains, Alaska. The series is of small extent.
