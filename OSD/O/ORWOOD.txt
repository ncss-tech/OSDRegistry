ORWOOD SERIES

The Orwood series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in eolian sediments. These soils are on side slopes, interfluves and crests on dissected till plains. Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C (47 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 81 centimeters (32 inches).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Mollic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Orwood silt loam, on a southwest-facing, convex slope of about 4 percent, in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (59 inches) (Ap, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and BC horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches) (Ap horizon);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 25 to 140 centimeters (10 to 55 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
