REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
a.	Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 41 cm (16 inches) (Ap and BE horizons).
b.	Argillic horizon - the zone from 41 to 165 cm (16 to 65 inches) (Bt and Btx horizons).
c.	Fragipan - the zone from 56 to 165 cm (22 to 65 inches) (2Btx1, 2Btx2, and 3Btx3 horizons).
d.	Aquic subgroup - as evidenced by redoximorphic features in the upper 25 cm (10 inches) of the argillic horizon (Bt horizon).
