ORAID SERIES

The Oraid series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium over residuum from non-calcareous sedimentary rocks.  These soils are on ridgetops, mountain slopes, scarp slopes, and foothills.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 5.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Typic Ustorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Oraid extremely flaggy sandy loam, forested.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    0i--0 to 3 cm; forest litter of undecomposed and decomposed needles, twigs, and cones.  (0 to 6 cm thick)

    A1--3 to 9 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) extremely flaggy sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, non-sticky and nonplastic; few coarse roots, common medium roots, and many fine and very fine roots; common medium and fine pores; 35 percent flagstones and 25 percent angular gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.9); diffuse wavy boundary.  (5 to 10 cm thick)

    A2--9 to 28 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely flaggy heavy loamy sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few coarse roots, common medium roots, and many fine and very fine roots, with root mattings between the fragments; many fine pores; 55 percent flagstones and 20 percent angular gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.9); diffuse wavy boundary.  (0 to 46 cm thick)

    AC--28 to 67 cm; very pale brown and pale brown (10YR 7/3 and 10YR 6/3) extremely flaggy loamy sand, yellowish brown and dark yellowish brown (10YR 5/4 and 10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few coarse roots and common medium roots; many medium pores; 60 percent flagstones and 25 percent angular gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (28 to 51 cm thick)

    R--67 to 79 cm; fractured non-calcareous sandstone; few fine roots in cracks in the upper few inches.
