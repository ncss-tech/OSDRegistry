ODENSON SERIES

The Odenson series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in glaciolacustrine sediments and a mantle of volcanic ash and loess. These soils are on low positions of terraces and adjacent to terrace drainageways and have slopes ranging from 0 to 2 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 33 inches and average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Esro series and the similar Hoodoo and Wrencoe series. Esro soils have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick. Hoodoo soils are ashy. Wrencoe soils are in a fine family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Odenson soils are on low positions of terraces and adjacent to terrace drainageways and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. Elevations range from 2,120 to 2,240 feet. The soils formed in glaciolacustrine sediments and a mantle of volcanic ash and loess. Average annual air temperature ranges from 43 to 45 degrees F; average annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 34 inches. The frost-free season is about 90 to 110 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Colburn, Mission, Pywell, Selle, and the competing Hoodoo and Wrencoe soils. Colburn and Mission soils are somewhat poorly drained. Pywell soils are formed in organic materials. Selle soils are sandy and well drained. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained; runoff is very slow. Permeability is moderately slow in the solum and slow in the substratum. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for hay, pasture, and grazing. A few areas are used for homesites. The natural vegetation is black cottonwood, quaking aspen, paper birch, Sitka alder, western redcedar, grand fir, and western larch with an understory of myrtle pachystima, northern twinflower, common princes pine, darkwoods violet, Idaho trillium, baldhip rose, and queencup beadlily. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Idaho. The soils of this series are not extensive.
