*NASIS Pedon ID--1977OR029001
*Andic soil properties--based on laboratory data from NSSL S01OR-035-002, 003, 004 and 005

11/2010--Type location moved from Klamath County to Jackson County (to the modal pedon for Oatman soil in the Jackson County Soil Survey manuscript), following correlation of the original Oatman type location to a frigid soil temperature regime.

05/2011--Classification changed from Loamy-skeletal, mixed Dystric Cryochrepts to Medial-skeletal, amorphic Typic Haplocryands based on lab data. 

06/2017--Updated this official series description according to SSRO1 Technical Note 11, OSD-- and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015). Most of the changes were in formatting.
