OSTRANDER SERIES

The Ostrander series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in 75 to 150 centimeters of silty or loamy sediments and in the underlying till. These soils are on summits, side slopes, or shoulder slopes on dissected till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 910 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
Series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 200 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:

Range in Characteristics were edited based on available lab data during the 2017 Ostrander SDJR Projects.

Differentia between Ostrander, Aredale, Cresken and Liscomb series needs further study

The type location has been moved to Bremer Co, Iowa to better represent the central concept of the series.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
