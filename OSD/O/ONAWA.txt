ONAWA SERIES

The Onawa series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on flood plains. These soils formed in 18 to 30 inches of clayey alluvium and the underlying loamy alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey over loamy, smectitic over mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Aquertic Udifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Onawa silty clay, on a nearly level flood plain, in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 7 inches; very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) silty clay; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; firm; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (6 to 10 inches thick)

 Cg1--7 to 22 inches; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) silty clay; massive with weak, thin alluvial stratification; firm; 1 inch layer of silty clay loam at 18 to 19 inches; few fine prominent red (2.5YR 5/8) and strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) redoximorphic concentrations; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (12 to 20 inches thick)

 2Cg2--22 to 60 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) and very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silt loam; massive; firm; few fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) and few fine distinct reddish brown (5YR 4/3) redoximorphic concentrations; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--18 to 30 inches of clayey alluvium and the underlying loamy alluvium
Landform--flood plains
Slopes--0 to 2 percent
Elevation--700 to 1,260 feet above sea level
Mean annual air temperature--46 to 56 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation--19 to 36 inches
Frost-free period--135 to 185 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Albaton, Blake, Percival, Grable, Haynie, and Modale soils.
Albaton--are in the slightly lower landscape positions, have a saturated zone within a depth of 1 foot during March to June in most years, and have a clay content of 50 to 60 percent throughout the particle-size control section
Blake--are in landscape positions similar to those of the Onawa soils and have a clay content of 22 to 35 percent throughout the particle-size control section
Percival--are in the slightly higher landscape positions, have a clay content of less than 10 percent in the lower half of the particle-size control section
Grable--are in the higher landscape positions, have a clay content of 12 to 16 percent in the upper half of the particle-size control section, and do not have a saturated zone within a depth of 6 feet during April to June in most years
Haynie--are in the slightly higher landscape positions, have a clay content of 15 to 18 percent throughout the particle-size control section, and have a saturated zone between depths of 4 to 6 feet during April to June in most years
Modale--are in the slightly higher landscape positions, have a clay content of 10 to 18 percent in the upper third to upper half of the particle-size control section, and have a saturated zone between depths of 1 to 3 feet during April to June in most years

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage class--somewhat poorly drained--a saturated zone occurs within depths of 1 to 3 feet during March to June in most years and is considered apparent
Permeability--slow in the clayey alluvium and moderate or moderately rapid in the underlying loamy alluvium
Surface runoff potentiallow or medium
Flooding--rare to occasional flooding with very brief or brief duration during the months of February to November from precipitation events and snowmelt and flooding from streambank overflow is limited where dams and levees protect areas

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are cultivated. The principal crops are corn, soybeans, and small grains. Some areas are land-leveled and irrigated. The native vegetation is big bluestem, little bluestem, western wheatgrass, indiangrass, switchgrass, and other grasses of the tall grass prairie.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
LRR M, MLRAs 102B, 107A and 107B, LRR G, MLRA 63B; along the Missouri River in Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and South Dakota. This series is of moderate extent.
