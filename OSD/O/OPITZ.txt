OPITZ SERIES 

The Opitz series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to grus, and deep to hard bedrock.  These soils formed in alluvium, colluvium, and residuum from coarse grained igneous rocks and coarse grained metamorphic rocks.  These soils are on ridges, plateaus, and sideslopes of mountains. Slopes are 2 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Ustic Argicryolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Opitz coarse sandy loam, bouldery, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 10 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) coarse sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 10 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. (7 to 13 inches thick) 

    Bt1--10 to 15 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick) 

    Bt2--15 to 22 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly coarse sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; 30 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary. (6 to 12 inches thick) 

    BC--22 to 36 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine and very fine tubular pores; 40 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual irregular boundary. (6 to 18 inches thick) 

    Cr--36 to 57 inches; decomposed granite bedrock (grus) that crushes to very gravelly coarse sand. (17 to 30 inches thick) 

    R--57 inches; hard granite bedrock.
