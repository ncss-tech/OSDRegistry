ODOME SERIES

The Odome series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived from sandstone and shale.  Odome soils are on shale hills.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Emery County, Utah, Emery area soil survey, Utah, 2011.  The name Odome comes from Oil Well Dome, a nearby topographic feature.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 85 cm.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 25 to 60 cm (part of By, and Cy horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 4 cm.  (A horizon)
Calcic horizon: The zone from 4 to 20 cm. (Bk horizon)
Gypsic horizon:  The zone from 20 to 60 cm.  (By and CBy horizons)
Paralithic contact:  The contact with weathered shale at 60 cm.  (Cr horizon) 

While individual subhorizons may contain up to 25 percent gypsum, the mineralogy control section averages 5 to 15 percent gypsum.  More soil sampling and/or lab sampling are needed to more accurately define the mineralogy.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
