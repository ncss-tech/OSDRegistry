OHWILER SERIES 

The Ohwiler series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from mixed sources, mostly sandstone and shale.  Ohwiler soils are on mountain slopes and mountain valleys.  Slopes range from 3 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 559 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5.6 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Argiustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ohwiler loam, on a southwest facing, simple, 20 percent slope in grassland at an elevation of 2,530.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  Described on September 10, 1985.

    A1--0 to 20 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  

    A2--20 to 38 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of A1, A2 - 18 to 60 cm)  

    Bt1--38 to 76 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; few fine roots; few fine pores; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual smooth boundary.  

    Bt2--76 to 102 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary. (combined thickness of the Bt1, Bt2 -  35 to 130 cm)  

    BC--102 to 132 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 36 cm thick)

    C--132 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0).
