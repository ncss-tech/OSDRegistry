Hillsmere soils -fine-loamy soils that occur on estuarine channel and mainland cove landforms; composed of fine estuarine deposits throughout; and contain hypersulfidic materials.
South River soils - coarse-loamy soils occur on Wave-Cut Platform landforms; composed of sandy estuarine deposits overlying Tertiary fluviomarine material; has greater than 15% glauconite by volume in the fine earth fraction and horizons with chroma 3 or more between 15 and 100 cm.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage Class: Subaqueous drainage
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: Moderately high to high
Soil Moisture Regime: Peraquic
Soil is permanently submerged / continuously inundated with brackish water. The presence of hypo-sulfidic materials within 50 cm of the soil surface puts these soils at extreme risk for potential acid sulfate soil formation if they are dredged and exposed to the air.

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses: Areas of this soil are used for recreational fishing, swimming, and boating. Commercial uses include shell fishing and aquaculture.
Dominant Vegetation: Benthic fauna such as clams, blue crabs, and oysters are associated with this soil. Eelgrass (Zostera marina), sea lettuce (Ulva sp.), and horned pondweed (Zannichellia palustris) may occur on these soils.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Atlantic Coastal Plain sub-estuaries of the western portion of the Chesapeake Bay and Atlantic Seaboard estuaries of the Northern Coastal Plain in New Jersey. MLRA 149A. This series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Anne Arundel County, Maryland, 2022.

REMARKS:  This subaqueous soil series is named for subaqueous equipment that fell "overboard" during this project on the South River sub-estuary of the Chesapeake Bay.  The equipment was retrieved and remains operational.  
Areas of Overboard soils were formerly included with water. 

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are (Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2012):
Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 20 centimeters (Ase horizon)
Peraquic feature - the zone from 0 to 317 centimeters is permanently saturated
Hyper-sulfidic materials - the zone from 0 to 176 centimeters incubated pH values less than 4 after 16 weeks
Lithologic Discontinuity - the zone from 176 to 317 centimeters (horizons 2Cg1, 2Cg2, 2Cg3 horizons of Tertiary aged fluviomarine deposits)
