OBURN SERIES

The Oburn series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Yellowstone County, Montana, 1969.

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretations Record:  MT0206.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches, mixed (A, E horizons); an albic horizon from 1 to 7 inches (E horizon); an argillic horizon from 7 to 19 inches (Bt, Btn horizon); horizons of sodium accumulation from 14 to 36 inches (Btn, Bny horizons); a discontinuity at 36 to 60 inches; a particle-size control section that is the argillic horizon 7 to 19 inches (Bt, Btn horizons).  Oburn soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.

Classification changed from Borollic Natrargids to Typic Natriboralfs in 1993.  A preferred classification is Glossic Aridic Natriboralfs.  An amendment to Soil Taxonomy is being proposed to provide for these subgroups.
