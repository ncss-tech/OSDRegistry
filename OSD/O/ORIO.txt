ORIO SERIES

The Orio series consists of loamy, deep to sand, poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils.  They formed in loamy material with a high content of sand on nearly level and slightly depressional parts of stream terraces and outwash plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 11.1 degrees C (52 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Mollic Endoaqualfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Orio loam - nearly level in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.  When described, the soil was moist throughout.)

Reaction: typically moderately acid to neutral but some subhorizons range from very strongly acid to slightly alkaline. 
Free  calcium carbonates are not within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). 

Ap or A horizon:

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ilion, Lantz, Olmsted, and Varick series.  Ilion, and Varick soils average less than 75 percent sand in the lower part of the control section.  Lantz soils have 14 to 40 percent rock fragments in the substratum. Olmsted soils do not have an albic horizon and typically contain gravel in some part of the solum.  Varick soils contain calcareous clayey shale soft fragments within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Orio soils are on nearly level or depressional parts of stream terraces or outwash plains.  Slopes typically are plane or concave with gradients of 0 to 2 percent.  Orio soils formed in stratified loamy and sandy outwash or alluvium.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.0 to 12.2 degrees C (50 to 54 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 890 to 1067 mm (35 to 42 inches).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Alvin, Bloomfield, Gilford, La Hogue, Onarga, Roby, and Selma soils.  Alvin, Bloomfield, and Roby soils average less than 18 percent clay in the control section and do not have surface layers as much as 15 cm (6 inches) in thickness that have color value of 3 or less.  Alvin and Bloomfield soils are on nearby ridges, slopes, and dunes.  Roby soils are on slightly higher parts of outwash plains or stream terraces nearby.  Gilford, La Hogue, Onarga, and Selma soils have mollic epipedons and do not have albic horizons.  In addition, Gilford and Onarga soils average less than 18 percent clay in the control section; the somewhat poorly drained La Hogue soils have higher chroma in the matrix or on faces of peds in the upper part of the argillic horizon; and Selma soils do not have an argillic horizon.  Gilford and Selma soils are on similar nearly level to depressional areas nearby.  La Hogue and Onarga soils are on higher lying or more sloping parts of stream terraces or outwash plains.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Poorly drained or very poorly drained.  Runoff is very slow or ponded.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderately slow.  A seasonal high water table is within a depth of 31 cm (12 inches) during spring in most years.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Many areas are used for cultivated crops.  Corn, soybeans, and meadow are the principal crops.  Some undrained areas are too wet for cultivation and are used for pasture.  Native vegetation is water tolerant grasses and sedges and scattered trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  MLRAs 95B, 108A, 108B, 115A, and 115C in Illinois and Iowa.  Extent is moderate.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  St. Clair County, Illinois, 1931.

REMARKS:  The Orio series was formerly classified as fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal Mollic Albaqualfs.  We find that Orio soils lack both an abrupt textural change and a strongly contrasting particle size class.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - 0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 inches) (Ap); argillic horizon - 46 to 89 cm (18 to 35 inches) (Btg1 and Btg2 horizons).

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Data for some pedons of Orio are on file at the Illinois state office.
