OPPORTUNITY SERIES

The Opportunity series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in glacial outwash with a minor component of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. Opportunity soils are on outwash plains and terrace treads and risers and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

Garrison soils have sandy skeletal material at 24 to 36 inches. Metmill soils have a mollic epipedon 30 to 60 inches thick and have 26 to 34 percent clay in the particle size control section. Neviot soils have a mollic epipedon 20 to 35 inches thick and are dry for 100 to 120 days. Northstar soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact. Peka soils are moderately deep to a densic layer. Thuso soils have a mollic epipedon greater than 20 inches thick and do not have silica and carbonate accumulations in the substratum. Wagberg soils have a hue of 2.5Y in the epipedon, do not have silica and carbonate accumulations in the substratum and are dry for 90 to 105 consecutive days. 

Similar soils with isotic mineralogy are the Borgeau, Emily, Lenz, Louiecreek, Raisio, Sinlahekin, Speigle, Vanbrunt and Whitestone series. Borgeau, Louiecreek and Speigle soils are more than 60 inches deep to sandy-skeletal material. Emily soils have a mollic epipedon 20 to 36 inches thick. Lenz, Raisio, and Vanbrunt soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact. Sinlahekin soils have a 2Bk horizon within 44 inches and a base saturation of 50 to 75 percent between 10 and 30 inches. Whitestone soils are dominated by rock fragments of granitic origin and have a solum thickness of less than 35 inches. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Opportunity soils are on treads and risers of outwash terraces and outwash plains at elevations of 1,800 to 2,500 feet. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The soils formed in outwash of mixed mineralogy with a minor component of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The average annual temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches. The frost-free season is about 100 to 130 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Battleplain, Hardesty, Marble, Phoebe, and Springdale soils. Battleplain soils are sandy and are on outwash terraces. Hardesty soils are formed in alluvium with more than 60 percent volcanic ash and are in drainageways and depressions. Marble soils have lamellae, are sandy and are on dune-like terraces. Phoebe soils are pachic, coarse-loamy and are on outwash terraces. Springdale soils do not have a mollic epipedon, are sandy-skeletal, and are on outwash terrace treads and risers. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate permeability in the surface and very rapid in the sandy-skeletal substratum. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for irrigated cropland, dryland cropland, urban development, grazing, and limited timber production. Cultivated areas are used for the production of alfalfa, grass seed, and small grain. The potential natural vegetation is scattered ponderosa pine with an understory ofSaskatoon serviceberry, arrowleaf balsamroot, common yarrow, common snowberry, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, prairie junegrass, silky lupine, and baldhip rose. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Washington; MLRA 43A, 44A. The series is of moderate extent.

Mollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 19 inches (Ap, A1 and A2 horizons) 
Cambic horizon - the zone from 19 to 43 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)

This series may meet criteria for an Ultic subgroup based on lab data from the similar Garrison soil series. 

Significant areas of Opportunity soils were previously mapped as the Garrison series in Spokane County. 

This soil is named for a nearby community.
