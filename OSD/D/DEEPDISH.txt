COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Wickiup series.  Wickiup soils lack the spodic morphology of a Bs horizon and have aquic conditions to the mineral soil surface.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape - lava plateau

Landform - depressions

Elevation - 4900 to 5660 feet

Slope - 0 to 2 percent

Parent material - volcanic ash and pumice from Mt. Mazama

Climate - cold, winters with much snow and cool, dry summers

Mean annual air temperature - 41 to 43 degrees F

Mean January air temperature - 25 to 27 degrees F

Mean July air temperature - 57 to 60 degrees F

Mean annual precipitation - 28 to 32 inches

Frost-free period - 0 to 10 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Lapine, Regcrust and Chocknott soils.  Lapine soils are on adjacent plateaus.  They are excessively drained and have a xeric moisture regime.  Regcrust soils are on nearby alluvial fans.  They average less than 35 percent pumice paragravel in the particle-size control section and have a Bg horizon beginning at a depth of 2 to 16 inches.  Chocknott are on nearby alluvial fans, stream terraces and drainageways.  They average less than 35 percent pumice paragravel in the particle-size control section and have dark colored surface layers 12 to 20 inches thick.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  
Drainage - somewhat poorly drained

Permeability - very rapid 

Flooding - none

Ponding - occasional

Water table - an apparent high water table is at its uppermost limit from April to July

USE AND VEGETATION:  Deepdish soils are used for timber production, wildlife habitat, watershed and recreation.  The potential natural plant community is the lodgepole pine/grass, xeric plant association group (CLG4).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Klamath County, Oregon; MLRA 6.  Series is of small extent.
