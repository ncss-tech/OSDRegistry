SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lafayette County, Arkansas; 2017.

REMARKS: 
The Dorcheat series was established to replace the Acadia soil series in MLRA 133B-Western Coastal Plains. The Acadia series was originally set up in MLRA 150A-Gulf Coast Prairies and correlated in MLRA's 150A, 152B-Western Gulf Coast Flatwoods and 133B-Western Coastal Plains. With such variations in the climatic environment, it was decided that a new series was needed to accommodate those soils in MLRA 133B. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 27 cm (0 to 11 in) (A,BE horizons) 
Argillic horizon: 27 to 168 cm (11 to 66 in) (Btg, Btg/E, 2Bthorizons)
Redox concentrations: 8 to 203 cm (3 to 80 in) (BE, Btg/E, 2Bt, 3BC horizons)
Redox depletions: 8 to 203cm (3 to 203 in) (BE, Btg/E, 2Bt, 3BC horizons)
Aquic conditions:   0 to 44 cm (0 to 17 in) (A, BE, Btg/E1)
Episaturation: 0 to 44 cm (0 to 17 in) (A, BE, Btg/E)
Reduced Matrix: 27 to 80 cm (11 to 31 in) (BE, Btg/E horizons)
