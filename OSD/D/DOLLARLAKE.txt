DOLLARLAKE SERIES

The Dollarlake series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mid-backslopes and footslopes of troughwalls in glaciated mountains. Dollarlake soils formed in till from basalt with an influence of volcanic ash. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 48 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 31 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, isotic Vitrixerandic Humicryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Dollarlake very cobbly ashy sandy loam, alpine meadow, on a 15 percent southfacing slope at an elevation of 7,920 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)
