DINSMORE SERIES

The Dinsmore series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches) of loess and the underlying glacial till. Dinsmore soils are on interfluves, ridges and side slopes on dissected till plains. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (49 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about (33 inches).

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters (10 to 40 inches) (A1, A2, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 and Bt4 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (0 to 60 inches) (Ap, A1, A2, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, and 2BC horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 41 centimeters (0 to 16 inches) (Ap, A1, and A2 horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 41 to 122 centimeters (16 to 48 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and Bt4 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

The Bt horizon does not have the 1.2 percent clay increase to meet the requirements of an argillic horizon.

Some pedons have vertical seams or wedges of sand or loamy sand about 5 to 15 centimeters (2 to 6 inches) wide and about 0.9 to 1.2 meters (3 to 4 feet) deep extending downward from the stone line into the glacial till.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
