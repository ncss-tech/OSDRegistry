DUTCHMAN SERIES 

The Dutchman series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium derived from sedimentary formations high in gypsum.  Dutchman soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 1 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, gypsic, mesic Typic Calcigypsids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Dutchman fine sandy loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    A--0 to 2 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium platy structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine, very fine, and few medium roots; many very fine vesicular, and common fine and very fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; violently effervescent, 16 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 2 inches thick) 

    Bk1--2 to 7 inches; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) fine sandy loam, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine, very fine, and few medium roots; common fine and very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel; violently effervescent, few fine irregular soft calcium carbonate masses, 23 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick) 

    Bk2--7 to 11 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/4) sandy loam, reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel; violently effervescent, common fine irregular soft calcium carbonate masses, 32 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick) 

    Bk3--11 to 20 inches; pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) sandy loam, pink (7.5YR 8/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and nonplastic; few fine and very fine roots; common fine interstitial and few fine and very fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; violently effervescent, peds engulfed with calcium carbonate, 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 15 inches thick) 

    2By1--20 to 33 inches; white (N 8/) sandy loam, pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) moist; massive; very hard, firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few fine irregular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; 70 percent weakly cemented gypsum; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 40 inches thick) 

    2By2--33 to 60 inches; pink (7.5YR 8/4) sandy loam, pink (7.5YR 7/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, nonsticky and plastic; few very fine roots; common fine irregular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; 35 percent crystalline gypsum; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8). 

TYPE LOCATION:  Mohave County, Arizona; about 22.5 miles south of the Arizona - Utah state line; west of the Hurricane Cliffs; 700 feet south and 125 feet west of the northeast corner of section 29, T.28 N., R.9 W; Latitude 36 degrees 40 minutes 16 seconds N, Longitude 113 degrees 16 minutes 38 seconds W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil Moisture:  Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July - September and December - February.  Driest during May and June.  Typic aridic soil moisture regime.

Soil Temperature:  55 to 59 degrees F. 

Percent gypsum x centimeters thickness = greater than 3000

Percent gypsum plus calcium carbonate = greater than 40 percent

Rock Fragments:   averages less than 15 percent gravel in the control section


Organic Matter:  less than 1 percent in the surface horizon 

Depth to Calcic horizon:  2 to 8 inches 

Depth to Gypsic horizon:  15 to 25 inches

By horizon
Hue:  5YR, 7.5YR
Value:  6 through 8 dry, 5 through 8 moist
Chroma:  0 through 6, dry or moist
Texture: fine sandy loam, sandy loam (5 to 15 percent clay)
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  5 to 20 percent

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Mussentuchit (UT) series. Mussentuchit soils are moderately deep to shale.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dutchman soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 1 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium derived from sedimentary formations high in gypsum.  Elevation ranges from 4000 to 5000 feet.  Mean annual precipitation is 7 to 11 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 53 to 57 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 165 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Delp and the competing McCullen series.  Delp soils have an argillic horizon and do not have both a calcic and a gypsic horizon above forty inches. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained;  slow to medium runoff;  moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Dutchman soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is black grama, blue grama, galleta, bush muhly, fluffgrass, Mormon-tea, fourwing saltbush, bottlebrush squirreltail, gyp dropseed, and trumpetbush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Arizona.  This series is of small extent. MLRA 35.
