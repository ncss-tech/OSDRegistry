DOUGH SERIES

The Dough series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum from sandstone.  Dough soils are on mesa tops and benches and have slopes of 1 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Lithic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Dough sandy loam, Pinyon-Juniper woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

     A--0 to 3 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 5 inches thick)

     Bw--3 to 11 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and medium roots; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (6 to 17 inches thick)

     R--11 inches; hard sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION:  Mesa County, Colorado; SE1/4 NE1/4 NW1/4 Sec. 13, T. 15 S., R. 101 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F.  Mean summer soil temperature is 62 to 66 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 7 to 20 inches.  Clay content in the particle-size control section is 10 to 27 percent.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 or 5, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Reaction ranges from neutral to mildly alkaline.

The Bw horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 through 6, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 or 5.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  Reaction ranges from neutral to mildly alkaline.

The C horizon, when present, has texture of sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy sand with colors similar to the Bw horizon.

COMPETING SERIES:  Currently there are no other series in this family.  The closely related Kopie series has a mesic temperature regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dough soils are on benches and mesa tops.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.  These soils formed in residuum from sandstone.  At the type location the elevation ranges from 7,300 to 8,400 feet and average annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual  summer temperature is about 62 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are moderately deep coarse-loamy, mixed, frigid Aridic Ustochrepts and Falcon, family soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for grazing and cordwood production.  Vegetation is Pinyon pine, big sagebrush, Indian ricegrass, scattered oakbrush, and blue grama at the lower elevations.  On the higher elevations vegetation is scattered Ponderosa pine, muttongrass, Arizona fescue, mountain muhly, and Parry oatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The Uncompahgre Plateau of Western Colorado and possibly adjacent areas in Utah.  The series is of minor extent.
