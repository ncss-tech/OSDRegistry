DULA SERIES

The Dula series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Dula soils are on flood plains and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C. and the mean annual precipitation is about 508 mm.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Cumulic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Dula loam - Pasture and hayland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 10 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; strong medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary. 

    A2--10 to 30 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate coarse granular structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine and common very fine roots; common fine tubular pores; few fine faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) masses of iron concentrations; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (combined thickness of A1, A2 - 21 to 40 cm)

    Bg1--30 to 46 cm; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; few fine tubular pores; few fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) masses of iron concentrations; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.

    Bg2--46 to 71 cm; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; few fine tubular pores; many medium distinct reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8) masses of iron concentrations; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (combined thickness of Bg1, Bg2 - 36 to 102 cm)

    2C--71 to 152 cm; variegated colors, extremely gravelly coarse sand; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; 60 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0).

COMPETING SERIES:
Degarmo (OR) - lack redox concentrations in the mollic epipedon
Flintcreek soils (MT) - have endosaturation above 30 cm

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform - flood plains  
Elevation - 1,950 to 2,440 meters
Slopes - 0 to 2 percent  
Parent material - alluvium
Mean annual air temperature - 4.4 to 7.2 degrees C.
Mean annual precipitation - 406 to 584 mm
Frost-free period - 80 to 100 days  

Dula soils have a water table at 30 to 107 cm April through August and are subject to frequent flooding.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; very low runoff.  Moderate permeability in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Dula soils are used for irrigated pasture and hayland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is narrowleaf cottonwood, shrubby cinquefoil, tufted hairgrass, bluegrass, and sedges.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern New Mexico, southern Colorado.  LRR D, MLRA 36. The series is of small extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, 1989. The name is coined.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 71 cm (A1, A2, Bg1, Bg2 horizons)
Endosaturation and aquic conditions: 30 to 152 cm (Bg1, Bg2, and 2C horizons)
Lithologic discontinuity: extremely gravelly coarse sand at 71 cm (2C horizon)
Irregular decrease in organic matter: 0 to 71 cm (A1, A2, Bg1, Bg2 horizons), inferred from landscape position

Dula soils have a frigid temperature regime and are in an aquic soil moisture regime with a typic subclass.
