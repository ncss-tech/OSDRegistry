SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: SPECIAL PROJECTS OFFICE

SERIES PROPOSED: Brazoria County, Texas, 2021. The name is coined from Dana Cove, a barrier cove in West Galveston Bay.

REMARKS: The series was formerly included with water. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are--
Particle-size control section--0 to 100 cm (0 to 40 inches) 
Ochric epipedon--0 to 22 cm (0 to 8 inches) (Ag horizon)
Peraquic feature--0 to 203 cm (0 to 80 inches) (Ag horizon and Cg layers are permanently saturated)

Additional Comments: Mineralogy based on data from adjacent subaerial barrier island soils and the content of shell fragments that make up the sand portion. 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Soil survey office lab data on pedon S2021TX1679120 from series type location.
