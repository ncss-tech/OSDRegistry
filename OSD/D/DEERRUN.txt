DEERRUN SERIES

The Deerrun series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils with moderately rapid permeability that formed in colluvium and residuum from granitic rocks. Slopes range from 8 to 90 percent in mountains and canyons. The average annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Ultic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Deerrun sandy loam, forested -- on a southwest-facing slope of 65 percent at 4,600 feet elevation. When described on June 21, 1994, the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

   Oi--0 to 1 inch; slightly decomposed forest litter.

   A--1 to 11 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium and coarse granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine irregular, few medium tubular pores; 5 percent fine gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.3); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 15 inches thick) 

   Bw--11 to 19 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, few medium roots; many very fine and fine, few medium tubular pores; 5 percent fine gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 20 inches thick)

   C--19 to 33 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) fine gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 20 percent fine gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.7); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 20 inches thick)

   R--33 inches; unweathered granodiorite.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ardening, Billyridge, Burrant, Canderly, Catelli, Crouch, Ginnis, Hellgate, Picard, Rebecca, Roney, Shangland, Texascreek and Wind River series. Ardening, Billyridge, Burrant, Canderly, Crouch, Hellgate, Picard, Rebecca and Wind River soils are greater than 40 inches in depth. Catelli soils have an annual soil temperature of 56 to 58 degrees F. and are dry for more than 200 days after the summer solstice. Ginnis soils have a paralithic contact and are dry for 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Shangland soils do not have O horizons and have a paralithic contact. Texascreek soils are dry 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice and have a paralithic contact. Roney soils do not have O horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Deerrun soils are on canyon walls and mountain slopes at elevations of 2,750 to 6,250 feet. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from granitic rocks. Slopes range from 8 to 90 percent. The average annual precipitation is 20 to 26 inches. The average annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F. The frost-free period is 90 to 125 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Drybuck, Hellake and Kisky soils. Drybuck and Hellake soils are more than 40 inches deep to bedrock and on smooth and concave geomorphic positions. Kisky soils are shallow to bedrock and on similar geomorphic positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; medium to very rapid runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Deerrun soils are used mainly for timber production, woodland grazing and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is ponderosa pine, antelope bitterbrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West-central Idaho. MLRA 43. Deerrun soils are of small extent.
