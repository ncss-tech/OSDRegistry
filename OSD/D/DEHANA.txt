DEHANA SERIES

The Dehana series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium weathered from welded rhyolitic tuff, latite, and volcanic ash. Dehana soils are on mountain sideslopes and breaks. Slopes range from 2 to 75 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 580 mm and the average annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Pachic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Dehana gravelly loam - on a southeast facing slope of 16 percent under rangeland vegetation at 2,256 meters elevation.  (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.  When described on August 17, 1981, the soil was dry throughout.)

    A--0 to 15 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many roots; many fine and very fine tubular pores; 25 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 50 cm thick)

    Bt1--15 to 38 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many roots; many fine and very fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 25 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (15 to 56 cm thick)

    Bt2--38 to 76 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common roots; many fine and very fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 25 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 50 cm thick)

    Bt3--76 to 165 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 20 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (25 to 100 cm thick)

    2C--165 to 178 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silty clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) moist; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; moderately acid (pH 5.6).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bachus, Benteen, Cambern, Clayburn, Crystalbutte, Davtone, DeCross, Demast, Dranyon, Echemoor, Gordo, Hagenbarth, Harmehl, Millerlake, Senchert, Southmount, Poodle, Stubbs, Thulepah, Vadnais and Winu series.  Bachus, Benteen, Cambern, Harmehl, Senchert, Poodle, Vadnais, and Winu soils are 50 to 100 cm deep to bedrock.  Crystalbutte and Dranyon soils have mollic epipedons that are less than 90 cm thick.  Clayburn, Hagenbarth, and Southmount soils have less than 20 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Davtone and Gordo soils have hues of 5YR, or redder, in the Bt2 horizon.  DeCross and Millerlake soils have Bk horizons.  Demast soils are greater than 50 cm to the Bt horizon.  Echemoor and Stubbs soils are 50 to 100 cm deep to a paralithic contact.  Thulepah soils have a mollic epipedon that is 16 to 56 cm thick and have an average annual summer soil temperature that is 13 to 15 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dehana soils are on mountain sideslopes and breaks.   The slope ranges from 2 to 75 percent.  The soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium from welded rhyolitic tuff, latite, and volcanic ash.  Elevations are 1,585 to 2,360 meters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 460 to 640 mm.  The average annual temperature is 2 to 6 degrees C.  The frost-free season is 20 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Amboat, Brose, Eep, Hogmalat, Keman, Mug, Rutherford, and Kavon soils.  Amboat, Keman, and Kavon soils are skeletal.  Brose and Hogmalat soils are shallow to bedrock and occur on ridgetops and summit shoulders.  Eep soils occur on the same landscape, but on drier exposures and are loamy-skeletal.  Mug and Rutherford soils are moderately deep to bedrock and occur on terraces and summit shoulders.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, slow through rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Dehana soils are used mainly for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The dominant natural vegetation is quaking aspen, common chokecherry, mountain big sagebrush, big bluegrass, Columbia needlegrass, mountain brome, and Idaho fescue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Dehana soils are of small extent in south central and southwestern Idaho. MLRA 25.
