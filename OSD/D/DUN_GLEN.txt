DUN GLEN SERIES

The Dun Glen series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a loess mantle high in volcanic ash.  Dun Glen soils are on fan skirts, inset fans, and basin floor remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 175 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Sodic Haplocambids

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dun Glen soils are on fan skirts, inset fans, and basin floor remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a loess mantle high in volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 1,160 to 1,680 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Adelaide, Blackhawk, Golconda, Raglan, and Weso soils.  Adelaide soils have duripans and buried argillic horizons.  Blackhawk soils have duripans.  Raglan soils have 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Weso soils have durinodes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; low surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Dun Glen soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly shadscale, bud sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, cheatgrass, pepperweed, and mustards.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  The series concept and main acreage is in MLRA 24, while other acreage occurs in MLRA 27.
