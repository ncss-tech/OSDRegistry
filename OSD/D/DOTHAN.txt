Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon: 

Particle-size control section: 33 to 83 centimeters (13 to 32 inches)

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 33 centimeters (0 to 13 inches) (Ap horizon)

Kandic horizon - the zone from 33 to 203 centimeters (13 to 80 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Btv1 and Btv2 horizons)

Plinthic feature - the zone from 91 to 203 centimeters (36 to 80 inches) (Btv1 and Btv2 horizons)

Masses of oxidized iron - 56 to 203 centimeters (22 to 80 inches) (Bt2, Btv1, and Btv2 horizons) 

Iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less - 91 to 203 centimeters (36 to 80 inches) (Btv1 and Btv2 horizons)

The classification changed from Paleudult to Kandiudult in recognition of the low activity clay amendment to the Keys of Soil Taxonomy 3rd Edition (1/89). This soil is currently classified according to the 12th Edition of the Keys of Soil Taxonomy. 

The OSD was moved to this location due to disturbance and urbanization of the former OSD site.
