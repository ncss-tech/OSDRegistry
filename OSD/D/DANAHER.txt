DANAHER SERIES

The Danaher series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from volcanic and sedimentary rock.  These soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive Ustic Glossocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Danaher loam, coniferous forest (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 0.5 inch; forest litter, mostly undecomposed. (0.5 to 2 inches thick)

    Oe-0.5 to 2 inches; forest litter, mostly decomposed. (0 to 2 inches thick)

    E--2 to 5 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine continuous irregular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 10 inches thick)

    E/Bt--5 to 9 inches; E part (70 percent) light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist tongues; Bt part (30 percent) grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 5 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual wavy boundary. (3 to 8 inches thick)

    Bt1--9 to 22 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; many faint clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent pebbles; moderately acid (pH 5.8); gradual wavy boundary. (8 to 20 inches thick)

    Bt2--22 to 40 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) clay loam, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; few fine discontinuous tubular pores; continuous faint clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.3); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 24 inches thick)

    Bt3--40 to 60 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) clay, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very fine, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; few fine discontinuous tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.0).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - mountains.
Elevation - 5,000 to 8,000 feet.
Slope - 4 to 60 percent.
Parent material - alluvium and colluvium from volcanic and sedimentary rock.
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers.
Mean annual precipitation - 18 to 30 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Danaher soils are used mainly for timber production, grazing, wildlife habitat, and watershed.  Potential native vegetation is mainly lodgepole pine and Douglas fir with an understory of grouse whortleberry, blue huckleberry, pinegrass, elk sedge, and common juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Danaher soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Powell County, Montana, 1995.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT0732, MT1414.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an albic horizon from 2 to 5 inches (E horizon); a glossic horizon from 5 to 9 inches (E/Bt horizon); an argillic horizon from 9 to 60 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons); a particle-size control section from 9 to 29 inches (Bt1, part of Bt2 horizons).  The Danaher soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on udic.
