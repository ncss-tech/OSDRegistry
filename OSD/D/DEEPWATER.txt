DEEPWATER SERIES

The Deepwater series consists of deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in a thin loess mantle and underlying residuum from shales.  Slope ranges from 1 to 10 percent, but typically are less than 5 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (60 degrees F).  Mean annual precipitation is about 1020 mm (40 inches).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Argiudolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Deepwater silt loam - on a 3 percent convex east-facing slope in pasture.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   A--0 to 36 cm (0 to 14 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; friable; many fine roots; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  [25 to 46 cm (10 to 18 inches) thick]

   BA--36 to 46 cm (14 to 18 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine roots; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary.  [0 to 165 cm (0 to 6 inches) thick]

   Bt1--46 to 58 cm (18 to 23 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; few faint clay films on faces of peds; patchy pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt coatings on faces of peds; few fine black concretions (oxides); strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.

   Bt2--58 to 71 cm (23 to 28 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) silty clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; many faint clay films on faces of peds; few fine black concretions (oxides); strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.

   Bt3--71 to 117 cm (28 to 46 inches); mottled light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) and light gray (10YR 7/2) silty clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; many faint clay films on faces of peds; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.  [Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 61 to 152 cm (24 to 60 inches).]

   BC--117 to 157 cm (46 to 62 inches); mottled light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) silty clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; 5 percent shale fragments; slightly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Henry County, Missouri; west side of road, 50 feet north and 1320 feet west of the southeast corner, sec. 33, T. 42 N., R. 26 W.  Clinton North topographic quadrangle; lat. 38.382167 degrees and long. -93.797611 degrees, WGS84.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Thickness of the Solum:  112 to 183 cm (48 to 72 inches)
Depth to lithic contact:  greater than 183 cm (72 inches)
Thickness of mollic epipedon:  25 to 61 cm (10 to 24 inches)
Reaction:  strongly acid to neutral in the upper part and strongly acid to slightly acid in the lower part
Clay content in the particle-size control section (weighted average):  28 to 35 percent clay

A or Ap horizon:
Hue:  10YR
Value:  2 or 3 (4 or 5 dry)
Chroma:  1 to 3
Texture: silt loam, silty clay loam

BA horizon:
Hue:  10YR
Value:  3 or 4
Chroma:  2 or 3
Texture:  silt loam, silty clay loam, loam

Upper Bt horizon:
Hue:  10YR or 7.5YR
Value:  4 or 5
Chroma:  3 to 6
Texture:  silty clay loam, clay loam

Lower Bt horizon and BC horizon:
Hue:  10YR or 7.5YR
Value:  4 to 7
Chroma:  2 to 6 and typically mottled
Texture:  silty clay loam, clay loam
Rock fragment content:  0 to 10 percent (shale)

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Catoosa, Dardanelle, and Mer Rouge series.  Catoosa soils have lithic contacts within depths of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches).  Dardanelle soils have thicker mollic epipedons.  Mer Rouge soils formed in alluvium and do not have coarse fragments in the solum.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Deepwater soils are on sloping uplands.  The soil formed in residuum from shale covered with a thin loess mantle.  Slope ranges from 1 to 10 percent but typically are less than 5 percent.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 12 to 18 degrees C (54 to 64 degrees F).  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 890 to 1220 mm (35 to 48 inches).  Elevation ranges from 198 to 328 meters (650 to 1075 feet) above mean sea level

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Barden, Hartwell, Barco and Roseland soils.  Barden soils occur on similar landscapes.  Hartwell soils occur on gentler slopes higher in the landscape.  Barco and Roseland soils do not have mollic epipedons and occur on the steeper side slopes lower in the landscape.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained.   Depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 89 to 137 cm (35 to 54 inches) during winter and spring in normal years.  Potential for surface runoff is moderate.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderate (4 to 14 micrometers per second) in the upper 81 cm (31 inches) and moderately slow (1.4 to 4 micrometers per second) in the lower 81 to 203 cm (31 to 80 inches).

USE AND VEGETATION:   These soils are cropped to corn, soybeans, small grain, and hay.  Some are used for pasture.  Native vegetation is tall prairie grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  MLRA 112 (Cherokee Prairies) in southwestern Missouri and adjacent areas of Kansas.  The series has large extent.
