DESKAMP SERIES

The Deskamp series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils on lava plains. They formed in ash. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy, glassy, mesic Vitritorrandic Haploxerolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Deskamp ashy loamy sand - rangeland, on a 3 percent slope at 3500 feet elevation. (When described (11/4/86), the soil was moist throughout. Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

 A1-- 0 to 4 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) ashy loamy sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. 

 A2-- 4 to 10 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) ashy loamy sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of A horizon is 10 to 14 inches) 

 AB-- 10 to 17 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) ashy loamy sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic, common very fine and fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 9 inches thick). 

 2Bq1-- 17 to 25 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly ashy loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; 5 percent weakly cemented nodules, hard, dry and friable, moist; 20 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick). 

 2Bq2-- 25 to 32 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly ashy loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine irregular pores; 10 percent weakly cemented nodules; 25 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (2 to 10 inches thick). 

 3R-- 32 inches; basalt. 

TYPE LOCATION: Deschutes County, Oregon; 100 feet west and 50 feet south of the northeast corner of section 15, T. 18 S., R. 12 E. (Latitude 44 degrees, 1 minute, 30 seconds N, Longitude 121 degrees, 19 minutes, 00 seconds W) 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil moisture control section is usually dry and is dry in all parts more than 120 to 150 days (cumulative). The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F. Depth to basalt bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The soil has a field estimated average clay content of about 0 to 5 percent. It has a phosphate retention of 15 to 25 percent, acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half of the acid oxalate iron of 0.4 to 0.7 percent and glass plus glass aggregate of 30 to 60 percent and 15-bar water content of 5 to 7 percent on dried samples. 

The A and AB horizons have color value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist with chroma of 2 or 3 dry and 1 to 3 moist. It is loamy sand and sandy loam. It has 0 to 5 percent gravel. 

The 2B horizon is loamy sand and gravelly loamy sand. It has 10 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles. Total rock fragment content is 10 to 30 percent. It contains 0 to 10 percent weakly cemented (silica) nodules that are friable when moist. It is neutral or slightly alkaline. 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Achelake (T) and Delrio (T) series. These soils are very deep. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Deskamp soils are on lava plains at elevations of 3000 to 4,000 feet. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The soils formed in ash. The climate is characterized by cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. The mean annual temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free period is 70 to 100 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Clovkamp and the Gosney soils. Clovkamp soils are on lava plains and are 40 to 60 inches to alluvium. Gosney soils are on lava plains and are less than 20 inches to bedrock. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for crop and forage production, livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Potential native vegetation is western juniper, mountain big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, Idaho fescue, needleandthread, and western needlegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Deschutes Basin of Central Oregon; MLRA 10. The series is of small extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Deschutes County (Upper Deschutes River Area), Oregon, 1992. 

REMARKS: The classification was changed in 1992 from mixed, mesic Xeric Torripsamments to ashy, mesic Vitritorrandic Haploxerolls based on andic soil properties analysis. 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon - from 0 to 10 inches (A1 and A2 horizons) 
Ashy family - based on laboratory data, glass contest is 35, 28 and 30 percent for the 0 to 6, 6 to 12 and 12 to 27 inch depths respectively. 
Andic soil properties are not met because the P-retention is 19, 22 and 17 for the above mentioned depths. 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Partial laboratory data are available for this soil. Reference sample S89OR-017-010 from Deschutes County, Oregon, NSSL, Lincoln, NE 7/12/90.
