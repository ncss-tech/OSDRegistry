DEWRUST SERIES

The Dewrust series consists of moderately deep over a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks with a component of volcanic ash.  The Dewrust soils are on fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 4 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Xeric Argidurids

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Goosel and Hunnton soils. 

Goosel soils are underlain by bedrock at moderate depth, and contain less than 15 percent coarse fragment in the particle size control section.  Hunnton soils are dry in the moisture control section from July through October and have average soil temperatures cooler than 13 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dewrust soils are on fan piedmonts.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed volcanic rocks, dominantly rhyolitic tuffs.  Slopes are 4 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 1,375 to 1,590 meters.  The climate is semi-arid with cool moist winters and warm intermittently moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 13 to 14 degrees C, and the frost- free season is 140 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Veet soils.  Veet soils lack an argillic horizon and a duripan.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow or medium runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly blackbrush, banana yucca, Mexican cliffrose and threeawn.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Nevada.  Dewrust soils are not extensive.  MLRA 29.
