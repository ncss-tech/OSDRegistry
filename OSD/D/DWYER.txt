DWYER SERIES

The Dwyer series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in eolian sand. Dwyer soils are on dune-like forms frequently on or near the edges of alluvial terraces and have slopes of 0 to 25 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, mesic Ustic Torripsamments

TYPICAL PEDON: Dwyer fine sand - grassland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  A1--0 to 6 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; single grain; loose; calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick)

  C--6 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) fine sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; single grain; loose; calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

TYPE LOCATION: Goshen County, Wyoming; approximately 200 feet south and 100 feet west of NE corner of SE1/4, NE1/4 of sec. 26, T. 22 N., R. 61 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Typically, this soil is calcareous throughout but is leached in the upper part of the series control section in some pedons. 
The control section is sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand..
Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent but are commonly less than 3 percent. These soils may have a weak and inconsistent accumulation of secondary calcium carbonate at any depth but are not considered to have a continuous Bk horizon. 
The soil is dry in the moisture control section more than half the time cumulative that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. and is never moist in some or all parts for as long as 60 consecutive days when the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F., which occurs about April 21-27, but is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for at least 60 consecutive days from July 15 to October 25 and for at least 90 cumulative days during this period. The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F., and the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more for 175 to 192 days. Bedrock is deeper than 60 inches.

A horizon :
Hue: 2.5Y or 10YR, 
Value: 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and 
Chroma: 2 or 3.
Texture: Fine sand, loamy fine sand or loamy sand 
Clay content: 2-10 percent
Sand content: greater than 80 percent
Reaction: mildly alkaline through strongly alkaline but is slightly acid or neutral in some pedons

AC horizon: 
Texture: loamy fine sand or fine sand is in some pedon.

The C horizon:
Hue: 2.5Y through 7.5YR
Value: 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist 
Chroma:2 through 4
Texture: Fine sand or loamy fine sand
Clay content: 2-10 percent
Sand content: greater than 80 percent
Reaction:  moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline and may contain few small carbonate concretions or seams of calcium carbonate erratically at any depth

COMPETING SERIES: 

Calladito soils have average annual precipitation less than 10 inches.
Curtis Siding soils have greater than 15 percent coarse fragments in the control section.
Karval soils have more gravel and rock fragments.
Orpha soils are noncalcareous above a depth of 30 inches. 
Mespun soils have a control section that dominantly has hue of 5YR and has chroma of 4 through 8. 
Mido soils are usually moist in September and October. 
Pinavetes and Penson soils are usually dry in May and June. 
Reepo soils have hard sandstone bedrock at 20 to 40 inches. Scoville soils are usually greater than 40 inches to carbonates and a 2C horizon.  
Tullock soils have a paralithic contact between 20 and 40 inches. 
Valent and Wigton soils are moist in some or all parts for 60 consecutive days following July 15 and are moist in some parts for at least 90 cumulative days when the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more and also have soil temperatures warmer than 41 degrees F. for 195 to 210 days or more.
Wigton soils also have a dry consistence of hard or very hard.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landscape:  terraces and rolling uplands 
Landform: hill slopes and dune-like forms frequently on or near the edges of alluvial terraces
Slopes:  irregular, ranging from 0 to 25 percent 
Elevation: 3,500 to 5,600 feet 
Parent material: eolian sand 
Average annual precipitation:  14 inches with about half of the precipitation occurring in April, May, and June 
Mean annual precipitation: 10 to 16 inches 
Mean annual temperature:  48 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 68 degrees F 
Frost-free season:  110 to 130 day.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
Orpha soils are noncalcareous above a depth of 30 inches 
Draknab soils have a stratified control section in which organic matter decreases irregularly with increasing depth 
Hiland soils have a sandy clay loam particle size control section and argillic horizons

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage :excessively drained
Permeability:  rapid
Runoff: very slow to medium runoff depending on slope and compaction

USE AND VEGETATION: Used principally as native pastureland. Native vegetation is short and tall grasses and sage.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Wyoming, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Colorado. The soil has moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Wheatland Area, Wyoming: 1926.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 1. Ochric epipedon - 0 to 6 inches (A)
2. Ustic subgroup - Aridic moisture regime bordering on Ustic. Usually dry, but moist for more than 48 days in all or some part of the moisture control section between April 30 and October 30 in most years.
