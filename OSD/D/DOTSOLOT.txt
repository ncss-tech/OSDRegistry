DOTSOLOT SERIES

The Dotsolot series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks.  Dotsolot soils are on mountains and hills.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid, shallow Aridic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Dotsolot very gravelly coarse sandy loam--forestland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The surface is covered with 25 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones, and about 2.5 cm of forest duff.

    A--0 to 18 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; 35 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 23 cm thick)

    Bt1--18 to 25 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 35 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 25 cm thick)

    Bt2--25 to 48 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely gravelly sandy clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine interstitial and tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 55 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.1); clear irregular boundary.  (0 to 28 cm thick)

    Cr--48 to 152 cm; weathered, fractured granodiorite.

TYPE LOCATION:  Douglas County, Nevada; in the Pine Nut Mountains; about 2,200 feet north and 100 feet east of the southwest corner of section 36, T. 13 N., R. 22 E.; USGS Pine Nut Valley 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 56 minutes 44 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 28 minutes 19 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.9455556 latitude, -119.4719444 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually moist in winter and spring, dry in summer and fall; aridic soil moisture regime that borders on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 18 to 30 cm; includes the Bt1 horizon in some pedons.
Depth to bedrock: 36 to 50 cm to a paralithic contact.  The paralithic materials below the contact are weathered granitic rock.
Reaction: Slightly acid or neutral.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 18 to 27 percent. 
Rock fragments: 45 to 75 percent, mainly fine gravel.  Lithology of fragments is granitic rocks such as granodiorite.

A horizon
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR.
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.
Organic matter content: 2 or 3 percent.

Bt horizons
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR.
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma: 3 through 6, dry or moist.
Texture: Very gravelly sandy clay loam, extremely gravelly sandy clay loam, or very gravelly coarse sandy loam.
Consistence: Soft to very hard dry; very friable or friable moist; slightly sticky or moderately sticky and slightly plastic or moderately plastic wet.
Organic matter content: 0.5 to 2 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Deanran, Garnel, Lyra, Pinenut, and Poisoncreek series.

Deanran, Garnel, Lyra, and Poisoncreek soils have paralithic contacts within 36 cm of the soil surface.  Garnel soils are moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October.  Lyra soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Pinenut soils are dominated by medium and coarse gravel.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dotsolot soils are on mountains and hills.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granodiorite and similar granitic rock.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,995 to 2,445 meters. The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm, mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 70 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Erastra and Nutval soils.  Erastra soils have a mesic temperature regime. Nutval soils are very deep and have thick mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; very high surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Dotsolot soils are used for forestland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly a forest canopy of singleleaf pinyon with an understory of muttongrass, currant, mountain big sagebrush, and curlleaf mountainmahogany.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 26.
