DEMNER SERIES

The Demner series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, slope alluvium and colluvium derived from basic and intermediate igneous rocks. Demner soils occur on alluvial fans and mountain slopes. Slopes are 2 to 70 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 350 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 5.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Pachic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Demner cobbly sandy loam, rangeland. (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The surface is covered with about 20 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles and 1 percent stones.

    A--0 to 10 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) cobbly sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2), moist; weak fine and medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, common medium and few coarse roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 19 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (10 to 25 cm thick)

    Bt1--10 to 21 cm; brown (10YR 5/3), gravelly fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, common medium and few coarse roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; few discontinuous distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 20 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear wavy boundary.

    Bt2--21 to 51 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/3), extremely gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2), moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; common very fine and few fine tubular pores; few discontinuous distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 45 percent gravel, 24 percent cobbles; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt wavy boundary.  (combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 35 to 58 cm)

    Bk--51 to 80 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4), moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; 54 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles; noneffervescent matrix, few discontinuous prominent carbonate coats on bottom surfaces of rock fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); abrupt irregular boundary.  (23 to 29 cm thick)

    C1--80 to 115 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), extremely stony loamy coarse sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4), moist; single grain; loose; common very fine and few fine roots; 38 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles, 20 percent stones; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt irregular boundary.

    C2--115 to 160 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4), extremely cobbly loamy coarse sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; 47 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

TYPE LOCATION: Sevier County, Utah; 1 mile south and 1 mile east of the Koosharem Reservoir; 1,300 feet east and 400 feet south of the northwest corner of section 5, T.26S., R.1E., SLBM.; USGS Burrville 7.5 minute quadrangle; lat. 38 degrees 35 minutes 2.1 second N. and long. 111 degrees 49 minutes 35 seconds W., NAD 83.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Nomara (NV) and Rypod (UT) series.  
Nomara soils are 50 to 100 cm deep to bedrock.  
Rypod soils have a calcic horizon with a calcium carbonate equivalent of 10 to 20 percent in the Bk horizons.
