DEFLER SERIES

The Defler series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash. The Defler soils are on inset fans. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Defler gravelly fine sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is covered with approximately 30 percent gravel.

    B'k2--86 to 97 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; few fine tubular pores; 45 percent gravel; noneffervescent matrix with slight effervescence in common fine carbonate filaments; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 43 cm thick)

    2C--97 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) stratified extremely gravelly coarse sand and very gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grained; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 50 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cliffdown, Clifterson, Clowfin, Dient, Myton and Trocken series. 

Cliffdown soils are moist for short periods in the summer and fall and have a mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 15 degrees C. Clifterson soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Clowfin soils do not have Bk or Bqk horizons. Dient soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Myton soils have clean sand and gravel in all parts below 64 cm. Trocken soils have Bw horizons and a mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 15 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Defler soils are on fan aprons and inset fans. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Elevations are 1,800 to 2,195 meters. The climate is cool, semiarid with hot, dry summers and cold, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C; and the frost-free season is 90 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the McConnel, Orovada, and Rasille soils. McConnel soils have a cambic horizon. Orovada and Rasille have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; slow or medium runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly winterfat, Indian ricegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Nevada. These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 28B.
