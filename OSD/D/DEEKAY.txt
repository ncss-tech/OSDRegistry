DEEKAY SERIES

The Deekay series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary sources.  Deekay soils are on fan remnants, terraces, alluvial fans, plateaus, hills and ridges.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Deekay loam -- on a southwest facing slope of 4 percent, utilized as rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated)

     A--0 to 4 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine and common medium roots throughout; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (1 to 7 inches thick)

     Bt1--4 to 8 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine angular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine, few medium roots; few distinct discontinuous very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay films on faces of peds; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary.

     Bt2--8 to 18 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium angular blocky; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine and very fine and common medium roots; many faint, few distinct discontinuous dark brown (10YR 3/3) clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary.  (Combined Bt horizons 5 to 23 inches thick)

     Btk--18 to 24 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine and common medium roots throughout; few distinct discontinuous dark brown (10YR 3/3)clay films on faces of peds and lining pores and root channels; slightly effervescent: common fine irregular light gray (10YR 7/2) threads of calcium carbonate throughout; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 12 inches thick)

     Bk--24 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots throughout; strongly effervescent; many fine light gray (10YR 7/2) threads of calcium carbonate throughout; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

TYPE LOCATION:  Campbell County, Wyoming; about 1250 feet east and 2220 feet north of the southwest corner of section 8, T. 50 N., R. 71 W.  44 degrees 19 minutes 35 seconds north latitude and 105 degrees 25 minutes 28 seconds west longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 15 to 36 inches.  Depth to accumulations of calcium carbonate ranges from 10 to 30 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent. The average annual soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It has texture of loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or clay loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.

The Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam or clay loam with 22 to 35 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent fine and coarser sand.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.

The Btk horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam or clay loam with 24 to 35 percent clay.  It has 3 to 12 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.

The Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is typically loam or clay loam, but may include fine sandy loam in some pedons.  It has 5 to 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

A C horizon occurs in the lower part of some pedons.   It has properties similar to the Bk horizon.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Arnor, Arwite, Augustine, Bigbow, Bosonoak, Carri, Celacy, Celavar, Dalhart, Dermala, Elwop, Evpark, Flugle, Fort Collins, Gateson, Goesling, Iwela, Lykorly, Maia, Nomrah, Nyjack, Oldwolf, Olnest, Orlie, Parkelei, Pinitos, Rauzi, Ribera, Rockybutte, Stoneham, Toluca and Wagonhound series.  Arnor soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments. Arwite, Rauzi and Wagonhound soils have more than 35 percent fine and coarser sand in the particle size control section.  Augustine, Dermala, Flugle, Goesling, Lykorly, Maia and Pinitos soils are moist in some part of the moisture control section during the 120 days following the winter solstice.  Bigbow soils have buried horizons at depths of less than 40 inches.  Bosonoak soils occur above elevations of 6500 feet and receive most of their precipitation between July and October.  Carri, Celavar, Evpark, Nyjack and Ribera soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Celacy, Elwop, Gateson and Oldwolf soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Dalhart soils have average annual temperatures of 52 to 59 degrees F.  Fort Collins soils are not dry for 45 consecutive days in July through September.  Iwela, Nomrah, Orlie, and Parkelei soils are usually dry in the moisture control section in May and June.  Stoneham and Toluca soils have secondary calcium carbonate accumulations at 10 inches or less and the base of the argillic horizon is less than 15 inches.  Olnest soils have a frost-free period of more than 135 days.  Rockybutte soils are moderately deep to porcellanite.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Deekay soils are on terraces, fan remnants, alluvial fans, plateaus, hills and ridges.  They formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 3,500 to 5,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 17 inches, half of which falls as rain or snow from March through June.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 44 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 105 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Oldwolf soils and the Iwait, Jaywest, Moorhead, Oshoto and Ziggy soils.  Iwait soils are calcareous throughout.  Jaywest and Moorhead soils are fine.  Oldwolf soils are moderately deep.  Oshoto soils are fine-silty.  Ziggy soils have a cambic horizon and are calcareous throughout.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; low to medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are utilized as rangeland, hayland and pasture, nonirrigated cropland, and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is mainly needleandthread, western wheatgrass, blue grama, and green needlegrass.  Winter wheat, oats, barley, and alfalfa are the principle cultivated crops.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Deekay soils occur in the Powder River basin of north-central and northeastern Wyoming.  The series is of limited extent.
