DITTMAR SERIES

The Dittmar series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in tephra and residuum from volcanic rock. Dittmar soils are on scoured glacial-valley walls. Slopes range from 20 to 80 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 51 inches (1295 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F (6 degrees C).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Medial-skeletal, amorphic, frigid Lithic Haploxerands

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Woodwest series. The Woodwest soils have an umbric epipedon and have 7 to 12 percent clay in the Bw horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dittmar soils are on scoured glacial-valley walls in the Southern Cascade mountains. Slopes range from 20 to 80 percent. These soils formed in tephra and residuum from volcanic rocks. Elevation is 5291 to 7406 feet (1613 to 2258 m). The mean annual precipitation is 43 to 91 inches (1092 to 2311 mm). The mean annual temperature is 41 to 43 degrees F (5 to 6 degrees C). Frost free season is 70 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kingsiron, Scoured and Juniperlake soils. The Kingsiron soils are very deep and formed in colluvium on the lower slopes on glacial-valley walls. The Scoured soils are moderately deep to bedrock, and are on glaciated uplands. The Juniperlake soils are deep to dense till, and are on moraines.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; saturated hydraulic conductivity is high.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for wildlife habitat, recreation, ecosystem management and watershed. Vegetation is greenleaf manzanita, huckleberry oak, bush chinquapin and Jeffrey pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The soils are inextensive and are mapped in MLRA: 22B Southern Cascade Mountains
