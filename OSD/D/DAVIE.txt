MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Davie County, North Carolina, 2009.

REMARKS: Davie series was formerly included with the Sedgefield series but was established to cover those soils now considered a mesic temperature regime.
Diagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 9 inches. 
Argillic horizon - the zone from 9 to 34 inches below the surface. 
Aquultic features - gray redox depletions in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon (Bt1).
