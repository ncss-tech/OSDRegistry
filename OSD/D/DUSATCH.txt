DUSATCH SERIES

The Dusatch series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived from sedimentary rock.  Dusatch soils are in low, concave or sheltered areas on mountain flanks and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 8 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm (18 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 4.5 degrees C (40 degrees F). These soils receive additional moisture from run-in and drifting snow.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Pachic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Dusatch loam on a south facing aspect with 20 percent slope.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)
