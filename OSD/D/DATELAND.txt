DATELAND SERIES 

The Dateland series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in stream or fan alluvium and eolian deposits. Dateland soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, fan piedmonts,  or relict basin floors. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches (18 cm) and the mean annual air temperature is about 70 degrees F (21.1 degrees C). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, hyperthermic Typic Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON: Dateland fine sandy loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)
 A--0 to 3 inches (0 to 8 cm); light brown (7.5YR 6/4) fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 5 percent fine gravel; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. ( 2 to 10 inches or 5 to 25 cm thick)
 Bw--3 to 40 inches (8 to 102 cm); reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) very fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 37 inches or 18 to 94 cm thick)
 Bk--40 to 54 inches (102 to 137cm); reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 20 percent fine gravel with calcium carbonate coatings on undersides; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (12 to 30 inches or 30 to 76 cm thick)
 2Btkb--54 to 60 inches (137 to 152 cm); reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) loam, yellowish red (5YR 5/6) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; few soft calcium carbonate masses; 5 percent fine gravel; violently effervescent; 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

TYPE LOCATION: Maricopa County, Arizona; 1950 feet south and 25 feet west of the northeast corner of section 11, T.3 S., R.2 W. Latitude of 33 degrees, 10 minutes, 59 seconds N., and longitude of 112 degrees, 25 minutes, 36 seconds W., NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture - Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July - September and December - February. Driest during May and June. Typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Soil Temperature - 72 to 78 degrees F. (22.2 to 25.6 degrees C)

Control section - Dominantly loam and very fine sandy loam in the control section.
Rock fragments - 5 to  35 percent in the control section; some horizons have greater than 35 percent  in sub-horizons.
Calcium carbonate - Noneffervescent to violently effervescent in the A and Bw horizons; strongly or violently effervescent in the Bk horizons. Calcium carbonate is disseminated in the fine earth and can occur as coatings on gravel and in pores in the Bk horizon. 
Reaction - slightly to very strongly alkaline
Electrical conductivity- 0 to 16 (dS/m)
Sodium adsorption ratio-: 0 to 13

A horizon
Hue: 10YR, 7.5YR, 5YR
Value: 4  to 7 dry, 4  to 6 moist
Chroma: 3 to  6, dry or moist
Organic matter content: Less than 1 percent 
Reaction: neutral to moderately alkaline
Calcium carbonate equivalence: 0 to 5

Bw horizon
Hue: 10YR, 7.5YR, 5YR
Value: 5 to 7 dry,  4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 3 to 6, dry or moist
Texture: very fine sandy loam, loam, minor strata of coarser or finer textures
Reaction: neutral to moderately alkaline
Calcium carbonate equivalence: 0 to 5

Bk horizon
Hue: 10YR, 7.5YR
Value: 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 3 to  6, dry or moist
Texture: loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, coarse sandy loam; some minor strata of coarser or finer textures
Reaction: slightly to strongly alkaline
Calcium carbonate equivalence: 2 to 8
A buried Bt horizon, when present, is at depths greater than 40 inches. 

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Denure (AZ) and Pahaka (AZ) series. Denure soils are moderately course-textured (dominantly fine sandy loam and sandy loam) in the control section. Pahaka soils have buried argillic horizons at depths of 20 to 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dateland soils are on alluvial fans, relict basin floors, stream terraces, or fan piedmonts. Slopes are  0 to 8 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from mixed sources. Elevations are 150 to 2,200  feet (46 to 671 meters). The mean annual precipitation is 2 to 10 inches (51 to 254 mm), which falls during summer thunderstorms and as gentle winter rains. The mean annual air temperature is 69 to 75 degrees F (20.6 to 23.9 degrees C). The frost-free period is 240 to 325 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cuerda, Pinamt, Rositas and Tremant soils. Pinamt and Tremant soils have an argillic horizon. Rositas soils are sandy. Cuerda soils have an irregular organic carbon distribution with depth. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow runoff; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Dateland soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Vegetation is big galleta, creosotebush, white bursage, ocotillo and cholla. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Arizona. The soils are extensive. Total extent is about 166,000 acres. MLRA is 40.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Yuma County (Yuma-Wellton Area), Arizona; 1977.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 7 inches (0 to 18 cm) (A horizon) 
Cambic horizon - the zone from 3 to 40 inches (8 to 102 cm) (Bw horizon)

The type location was moved from Yuma County (Yuma-Wellton Area) to the present location in Maricopa County (Gila Bend-Ajo Area) in 1987.
