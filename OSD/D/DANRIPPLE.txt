MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Halifax County, Virginia, 2001.

REMARKS: Danripple soils were previously mapped as Masada soils. Division of MLRA 136 into mesic and thermic areas necessitated the addition of this series. These soils formed in old alluvium derived from soils weathered from a mixture of felsic and mafic metamorphic and igneous rocks.  Revision dated 03/09, allows a flooding class of none-DTA.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 10 inches (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 10 to 48 inches (Bt horizon) 
Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches
