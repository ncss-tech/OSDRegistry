DOOLIN SERIES

The Doolin series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils.  The Doolin soils upper part formed in old alluvium and the lower part formed in sandstone of Permian age. These soils are on slightly concave to linear summits of paleoterraces on high stream divides in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A).  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, thermic Typic Natrustolls

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family. Soils in similar families in MLRA 80A are the Drummond, Huska, Pawhuska, and Seminole series.
Drummond, Huska, Pawhuska, and Seminole soils: have mixed mineralogy
Drummond and Pawhuska soils: have ochric epipedons
Drummond soils: have a solum less than 152 cm (60 in) thick and are on flood plains
Huska soils: do not have a lithologic discontinuity, and are 102 to 152 cm to sandstone
Seminole soils: do not have an abrupt textural change between the A and Btn horizons, and do not have sandstone bedrock

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: The upper part formed in old alluvium and the lower part formed in residuum from sandstone of Permian age
Landform: slightly concave to linear summits of paleoterraces on high stream divides 
Slope: 0 to 3 percent
Mean Annual Precipitation: 830 to 1020 mm (34 to 40 in)
Mean Annual Temperature: 14 to 16 degrees C (58 to 60 degrees F)
Thornthwaite Annual P-E indices: 44 to 64

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the similar Pawhuska series and the Kirkland, Renfrow, Chickasha, and Zaneis series.
Chickasha and Zaneis soils: do not have a natric horizon, have a fine-loamy control section, and occur on side slopes below the Doolin soils
Kirkland and Pawhuska soils: are on similar landscapes.
Renfrow soils: are commonly on upper side slopes below the Doolin soils

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage: Moderately well drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: low
Runoff: negligible on concave areas, high on 0 to 1 percent slopes and very high on 1 to 3 percent slopes
Wetness characteristics do not reflect current redoximorphic features, but are relict

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas have been cultivated and are now in low condition grasses such as threeawn.  These areas are used for rangeland.   Some areas are cultivated to small grains or improved pasture.  Native vegetation is mainly mid and short grass prairie.  The Ecological Site is Claypan Prairie (North) PE 44-64 (R080AY010OK). 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A) of Oklahoma.  The series is not extensive.
