DANJAY SERIES

The Danjay series consists of moderately deep, excessively drained soils that formed in residuum derived from noncalcareous sandstone.  Danjay soils are on shoulders and backslopes of ridges in mountains.  Slopes range from 6 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 610 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Frigid, coated Typic Quartzipsamments

TYPICAL PEDON:  Danjay loamy fine sand, on a northwest facing, linear backslope of 16 percent, in a mixed coniferous and herbaceous plant community at an elevation of about 1,525 meters.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on October 9, 2008 the soil was slightly moist.

    Oe--0 to 3 cm; moderately decomposed pine needles, twigs, and herbaceous litter.  (O horizon is 1 to 4 cm thick)

    A--3 to 9 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loamy fine sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and  fine, few medium and coarse roots; about 15 percent weakly to moderately cemented, subrounded and subangular gravel-sized sandstone parafragments; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 23 cm thick)

    AC--9 to 25 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) fine sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; about 35 percent sandstone rock fragments, of which 10 percent are strongly and very strongly cemented, subrounded and subangular gravel, and 25 percent are weakly to moderately cemented, subrounded and subangular gravel-sized parafragments; slightly acid; clear irregular boundary.  (0 to 25 cm thick)

    C--25 to 75 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) cobbly fine sand, very pale brown (10YR 8/4) dry; massive parting to single grain; loose, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; about 70 percent sandstone fragments, of which about 10 percent are cobble, 5 percent are subrounded and subangular gravel, 25 percent are cobble-size parafragments, and 25 percent are gravel-sized parafragments; neutral; clear irregular boundary.  (48 to 76 cm thick)

    Cr--75 to 122 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) to very pale brown (10YR 8/4), weakly to moderately cemented, noncalcareous sandstone; material is fractured and breaks into angular and subangular cobble and stone size fragments; slightly alkaline. (20 to 50 cm thick)

    R--122 to 200 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 5/4) to light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4), very strongly cemented to indurated, noncalcareous sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lawrence County, South Dakota; about 5 miles southwest of Spearfish, South Dakota; about 900 feet east and 2,490 feet north of the southwest corner of Sec. 32, T. 6 N., R. 2 E.; Maurice USGS quad; 44 degrees 26 minutes 16.4 seconds N. latitude and 103 degrees 55 minutes 22.6 seconds W. longitude; NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth to paralithic contact:  50 to 100 cm 
Depth to lithic contact:  typically 100 to 152 cm 

Particle-size control section (weighted average):  
Rock fragments:  10 to 35 percent subangular and subrounded, noncalcareous gravel and cobble-sized sandstone fragments.
Pararock fragments:  5 to 50 percent subangular and subrounded, noncalcareous gravel and cobble-sized sandstone fragments.

A horizon:
Hue:  10YR
Value:  2 or 3, 4 or 5 dry
Chroma:  1 to 3
Texture:  LFS, LS, FS
Rock fragments:  0 to 15 percent
Pararock fragments:  0 to 20 percent 
Reaction:  neutral or slightly acid

An AC horizon, if present, has properties similar to the A and C horizons. 

C horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR
Value:  4 or 5, 5 or 6 dry
Chroma:  3 through 6
Texture:  LFS, FS, GR-FS, CB-FS
Reaction:  slightly acid to slightly alkaline

The Cr and R horizons typically consist of concalareous sandstone; however, some pedons contain strata that are may effervesce.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no series competing with this soil.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  residuum derived from noncalcareous sandstone; some areas have a thin wind-reworked surface layer
Landform:  shoulders and backslopes of ridges in mountains
Slopes:  6 to 80 percent
Elevation:  1,220 to 1,645 meters
Mean annual air temperature:  6 to 8 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation:  510 to 710 mm 
Precipitation pattern:  Over half the mean annual precipitation on average falls as rain and snow from April through mid-July.
Frost-free period:  100 to 125 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Citadel, Hopdraw, and Tollflat series.
Citadel and Tollflat(T) are very deep and have argillic horizons with more than 35 percent clay; they occur on backslope and footslope positions generally below Danjay soils.
Hopdraw - are sandy-skeletal and deep; they occur on similar landscape positions as Danjay soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Excessively drained; high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity

USE AND VEGETATION:  Danjay soils are generally wooded and are utilized for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and limited timber production.  The native vegetation consists of an overstory of ponderosa pine, with scattered aspen and bur oak; understory species include Oregongrape, bearberry, roughleaf ricegrass, needlegrass, and blue grama. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Danjay soils occur on the Low Limestone Plateau physiographic area in the Black Hills of South Dakota and Wyoming; LRR G, MLRA 62; the series is of small extent.
