DAYCREEK SERIES

The Daycreek series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in sandy eolian sediment. These soils occur on valley floors, flats, or depressions surrounded by dunes of the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slopes ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 660 mm (26 in) and mean annual temperature is 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, thermic Aquic Ustipsamments

TYPICAL PEDON:  Daycreek loamy fine sand, on a south-facing, concave, 0 to 2 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 393 m (1288 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

   A--0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in); brown (7.5YR 5/2) loamy fine sand, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; many fine and medium roots; 2 percent fine distinct brown (7.5YR 5/4) masses of oxidized iron with clear boundaries; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary. (Thickness of the A Horizon 15 to 30 cm [6 to 12 in])

   AC--20 to 58 cm (8 to 23 in); light brown (7.5YR 6/4) fine sand, brown (7.5YR 5/4), moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable; common fine roots; 2 percent fine distinct red (2.5YR 4/6) masses of oxidized iron with clear boundaries; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (Thickness of the AC horizon is 25 to 64 cm [10 to 25 in])

   C1--58 to 104 cm (23 to 41 in); light brown (7.5YR 6/4) fine sand, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; single grain; loose, loose; few fine roots; 2 percent medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron with clear boundaries; 2 percent medium distinct light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) masses of depleted iron with clear boundaries; root channels are lined with grayish brown (10YR 5/2) masses of depleted iron; few black stains; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. 

   C2--104 to 203 cm (41 to 80 in); brown (7.5YR 5/4) fine sand, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; single grain; loose, loose; 50 percent stratified with common thin strata of loamy fine sand and sand; moderately alkaline.
