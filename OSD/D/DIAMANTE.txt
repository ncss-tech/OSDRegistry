DIAMANTE SERIES

The Diamante series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in valley fill alluvial deposits. Diamante soils are on strongly dissected, very old alluvial beds and have slopes of 15 to 80 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Diamante extremely gravelly loam, forested. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oe--0 to 3 cm; forest litter in various stages of decomposition.

    A--3 to 8 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, friable; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine pores; 50 percent pebbles and 20 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 13 cm thick)

    E1--8 to 38 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) extremely gravelly sandy loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, friable; many very fine and few medium and coarse roots; many very fine pores; 70 percent pebbles and 15 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary. (25 to 50 cm thick)

    E2--38 to 81 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) extremely gravelly sandy loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; weak very fine granular structure and single grained; soft, friable, many very fine, fine, and few medium roots; many fine pores; 75 percent pebbles and 10 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary. (25 to 50 cm thick)

    Bt1--81 to 104 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very gravelly sandy clay, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; strong fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, sticky and plastic; many moderately thick clay films on faces of peds; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine pores; 50 percent pebbles and 10 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6); gradual wavy boundary. (20 to 30 cm thick)

    Bt2--104 to 155 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) extremely gravelly sandy clay, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, sticky and plastic; thin patchy clay films on faces of peds; few very fine pores; 50 percent pebbles and 15 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6).
