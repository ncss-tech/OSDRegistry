DACOSTA SERIES

The Dacosta series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy and clayey fluviomarine deposits derived from the Beaumont Formation of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on flats on coastal plains. Slope is mainly less than 1 percent but range up to 3.  Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (70 degrees F).

Contee soils:  do not have an argillic horizon and are on microhighs adjacent to Dacosta soils in complex soil areas.  
Edna and Telferner soils:  have an abrupt texture change between the A and Bt horizons; lighter surface layer; and are on meander ridges
Laewest soils: are clayey throughout on a similar landform

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage class: Moderately well
Permeability class: very slow
Runoff: high on 0 to 1 percent slopes and very high on 1 to 3 percent slopes
Water enters the soil rapidly when it is dry and cracked and moves through the cracks freely.  Water moves very slowly through the soil when it is wet.  Water perches on top of the argillic horizon for periods of 1 to 2 weeks following extended heavy rains.  During wet years planting may be delayed for short periods.

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major uses: cropland for growing grain sorghums, cotton, rice, and improved pasture.
Native vegetation:  grasses are mainly species of andropogons and paspalums. Elm, mesquite, and huisache trees are common in some areas.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Calhoun County, Texas; 1972.

REMARKS: Dacosta soils were formerly included in the Bernard series.

The classification is changed from Vertic Albaqualfs to Vertic Argiudolls based on the soil moisture study ISCOM VIII, Classification and Management of Wet Soils, 1990. This soil does not have an aquic moisture regime.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon: 0 to 30 cm (0 to 12 in).
Argillic horizon: 15 to 203 cm (6 to 80 in).
