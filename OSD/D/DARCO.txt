DARCO SERIES

The Darco series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy residuum from Southern Coastal Plain marine deposits of the Carrizo Sand, Queen City Sand, and Sparta Sand Formations. These gently sloping to steep soils are on uplands. Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1270 mm (40 to 50 in) and the mean annual air temperature ranges from 17 to 20 degrees C (63 to 68 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Betis, Briley, Cuthbert,  Lilbert, Tenaha, and Tonkawa series. 
Betis soils: have an argillic horizon that consists of lamellae and are on positions similar to Darco.                                                                                                                                  
Briley, and Lilbert soils: Have a sandy epipedon that is 50 to 100 cm (20 to 40 in) thick and are on positions similar to Darco. 
Tonkawa soils: Are sandy throughout, do not have an argillic horizon, and are on similar or slightly higher positions in the landscape. 
Cuthbert soils: Have a loamy epipedon and are on lower side slope positions.
Tenaha soils: Have a sandy epipedon that is 50 to 100 cm (20 to 40 in) thick and are on lower side slope positions. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained. Permeability is rapid in the sandy epipedon, and moderate in the argillic horizon. Runoff is negligible on 1 to 5 percent slopes, very low on 5 to 20 percent slopes, and low on slopes greater than 20 percent. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of the soil is used for pasture or woodland. Pastures are mainly in coastal bermudagrass or weeping lovegrass. Native trees include loblolly pine, shortleaf pine, red oak, and hickory. Watermelons, peanuts, small grain for grazing, and vegetables are grown in some areas. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Texas, Arkansas, and Mississippi. The series is extensive. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Anderson County, Texas; 1970. 

REMARKS: These soils were formerly included in the Lakeland and Troup series. The series was updated in 2002 to allow value 6 in the Bt horizon and to allow clay loam texture below 60 inches deep. The series was updated in 2004 to allow 7.5YR hue in the E and EB horizons. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 117 cm (46 in) (Ap, E1, E2, E3, horizons) - thickness and texture results in Grossarenic subgroup. 

Argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 117 to 218 cm (46 to 86 in) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons) 

ADDITIONAL DATA: KSSL data from Type location S74TX-001-1 and TAMU pedon S80TX-405-003.
