DALEROSE SERIES

The Dalerose series consists of soils that are very shallow and shallow to hard sandstone bedrock.  The are well drained moderately permeable soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from sandstone. Dalerose soils are on ridges and scarps slopes in the plains. Slope ranges from 3 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Lithic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Dalerose  gravelly fine sandy loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 5 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 20 percent pebbles; 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 12 inches thick)

    Bk--5 to 10 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 5 percent cobbles and 25 percent pebbles; 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt irregular boundary. (1 to 6 inches thick)

    R--10 inches; hard sandstone bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Altezita (T NM), Apache (NM), Hedville (KS),and Sogn (KS) series.  Potential competitors were superactive cation exchange activity class assigned are Purner (AZ), Santana (NM), and Venezia (AZ) series.

Altezita soils: receive significant amounts of winter precipitation.
Apache soils: have lithic contact over basalt and average more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. 
Hedville soils: do not have free carbonates above the bedrock. 
Sogn soils: have soil moisture control sections that are moist in some or all parts more than twice as long when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. and average 20 to 35 percent clay in the particle size control section.
Purner soils: have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR
Santana soils: have soil temperature of 50 to 54 degrees F. and have higher clay content in the particle size control section.
Venezia soils: do not have free carbonates above the bedrock. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: slope alluvium and residuum derived from sandstone.
Landform: plains ridges and scarps. 
Slope: 3 to 30 percent. . 
Elevation: 5,000 to 6,000 feet. 
Mean annual air temperature:  50 to 54 degrees F. 
Mean annual precipitation:  14 to 17 inches:

Frost-free period: 120 to 155 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Apache, Ayon, Capulin, Chacuaco (T), Travesilla, and Villegreen (T) series.
Apache soils: on summits and backslopes of adjacent basalt flows and lava plateaus. 
Ayon and Capulin soils: do not have bedrock above 40 inches and generally are on fans and ridges. 
Chacuaco soils: have a lithic contact at depths of 20 and 40 inches. 
Travesilla soils: do not have a mollic epipedon and are on scarps.
Villegreen soils: have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; runoff is very high; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for livestock grazing. Principal native vegetation is blue grama, sideoats grama, and little bluestem, oneseed juniper, and Gambel's oakbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Dalerose soils occur in southeastern Colorado. LRR G, MLRA's 67 and 70. The series is of moderate extent.
