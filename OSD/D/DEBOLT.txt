DEBOLT SERIES

The Debolt series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in clayey glaciofluvial deposits overlying sandy glaciofluvial deposits on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 5.6 degrees C (42 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, semiactive, frigid Oxyaquic Glossudalfs

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Debolt soils are on lake plains of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The Debolt soils formed in clayey glaciofluvial deposits overlying sandy glaciofluvial deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 813 mm (28 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 4.4 to 6.7 degrees C (40 to 44 degrees F). Frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The well drained Dighton soils are on slightly higher landform positions. The moderately well drained Kellogg soils are on similar landform positions. The somewhat poorly drained Pinewood soils are on slightly lower landform positions. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Wakeley soils are in nearby depressions and narrow drainageways.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The potential for surface runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part and high or very high in the lower part. Permeability is moderately slow in the upper part and rapid or very rapid in the lower part.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are idle or in pasture. A smaller part is in forest. Native vegetation is chiefly sugar maple, American beech, American basswood, American elm, and some eastern white pine and eastern hemlock.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 94A in northern Lower Peninsula of Michigan. The series is of small extent.
