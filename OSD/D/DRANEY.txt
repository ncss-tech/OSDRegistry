DRANEY SERIES

The Draney series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in a thin mantle of alluvium over weakly consolidated tuffaceous calcareous siltstone or sandstone or weakly consolidated calcareous ash.  These soils are on convex shoulder positions on hills.  Permeability is moderately rapid. Slopes are 15 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid, shallow Typic Calcixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Draney gravelly loam, rangeland; on a 16 percent slope at an elevation of 6,180 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 6 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; 15 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 6 inches thick)

    Bk1--6 to 12 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; lime is disseminated and as thin coats on all fragments; 15 percent gravel and 5 percent paragravel; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  

    Bk2--12 to 18 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) paragravelly loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; lime is disseminated and as thin coats on all fragments; 10 percent gravel and 20 percent paragravel; strongly effervescent;  moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness is 8 to 15 inches)

    2Cr--18 to 60 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) weakly consolidated calcareous tuffaceous siltstone. 

TYPE LOCATION: Bear Lake County, Idaho; about 3 miles northwest of Bennington, Idaho;  about 1,780 feet east and 960 feet north of the southwest corner of section 35, T. 12 S., R. 43 E.  (42 degrees 25 minutes 5.7 seconds North Latitude and 111 degrees 23 minutes 57.9 seconds West Longitude.)

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform: convex shoulder positions on hills of the Salt Lake Formation
Elevation: 5,980 to 6,400 feet
Slope: 15 to 30 percent
Parent Material: thin mantle of alluvium over weakly consolidated calcareous tuffaceous siltstone or sandstone, or weakly consolidated calcareous ash
Climate: long, cool winters; dry, warm summers
Average annual precipitation: 12 to 16 inches
Average annual temperature: 41 to 44 degrees F.
Frost-free season: 70 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brushtop (T), Redpine (T), and  Whitetop (T), soils.  Brushtop soils are deep to weakly consolidated ash, have argillic horizons and occur on north facing backslopes and footslopes.  Redpine soils are moderately deep to weakly consolidated ash, have argillic horizons and occur on backslopes and shoulder slopes.  Whitetop soils are shallow, formed from weakly consolidated ash, lack significant carbonates throughout the control section and occur on shoulder slopes and upper backslopes.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for wildlife habitat and rangeland.  The dominant native vegetation is low sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Indian ricegrass, bluegrass, needleandthread and  prairie junegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Idaho. The series is not extensive.
