DULLAXE SERIES

The Dullaxe series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from granitic or metamorphic rocks with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  They are on mountain slopes and ridges.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and moderately rapid or rapid in the lower part. Slopes range from 10 to 75 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Flewsie series.  Flewsie soils have less than 20 percent medium sand or coarser in the less than 2mm fraction.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dullaxe soils are on mountain slopes and ridges at elevations of 2,000 to 5,000 feet.  They have slopes of 10 to 75 percent.  These soils formed in material weathered from granitic and metamorphic rocks with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  The average annual air temperature is 38 to 44 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is 35 to 60 inches.  The frost free season is 50 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brodeer (T), Grandad (T), Judgetown (T), Mushel (T), and Narnett (T) series.  Brodeer soils are on moutain slopes and hills and have an argillic horizon. Grandad(T) soils are on mountain slopes and ridgetops and have an argillic horizon and a surface of more than 14 inches of volcanic ash.  Judgetown soils are on mountain slopes and hills and are deep to a paralithic contact. Mushel soils are on mountain slopes and ridges and have a surface of 7 to 14 inches of volcanic ash. Narnett soils are on alluvial terraces and have a cryic soil temperature regime and a surface of 7 to 14 inches of volcanic ash.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; permeability is moderate in the upper part and moderately rapid or rapid in the lower part.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, wildlife habitat, watershed and recreation.  Potential natural vegetation is western redcedar, grand fir, western larch and Douglas fir with an understory of wild ginger, queencup beadlily, goldthread, common beargrass and starry false Solomons seal.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-Central Idaho.  These soils are moderately extensive.
