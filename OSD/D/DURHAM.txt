SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Distribution: North Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and Virginia. Extent: Moderate

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Raleigh to New Bern Area, North Carolina,
1900.

REMARKS: 
Durham soils were formerly placed in the Red-Yellow Podzolic great soil group. They ranged in texture in the B horizon from moderately-fine to fine, and in drainage from well drained to moderately well drained. This revision restricts the texture of the argillic horizon to fine-loamy and the drainage class to well drained. The 2017 version moved the type location from Wake County, North Carolina to Lee County, North Carolina. With the update to the Wake County Soil Survey, Durham soils are no longer mapped in Wake County.  The November 2025 revision corrected some of the formatting. No data was changed.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 38 centimeters (0 to 15 inches) (A and E  horizons).
Argillic horizon--the zone from 38 to 124 centimeters (15 to 49 inches) (Bt horizons).
