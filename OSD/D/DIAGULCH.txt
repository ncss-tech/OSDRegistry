DIAGULCH SERIES

The Diagulch series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits over slope alluvium derived from limestone and quartzite rocks.  Diagulch soils are on hills.  Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Diagulch loam, on a northeast facing, convex-concave, 4 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 7,265 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    C1--34 to 53 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) sandy loam, dark red (2.5YR 3/6) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; strongly effervescent (10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 19 inches thick)

    C2--53 to 60 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) gravelly loamy sand, dark red (2.5YR 3/6) moist; massive; very hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; 5 percent cobbles and 15 percent gravel; slightly effervescent (9 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Clyl, Cortyzack, Dokie, Flynncove, and Tridell series.

Clyl and Dokie soils occur on mountain slopes and are loamy-skeletal.

Cortyzack soils are on hillslopes and have an argillic horizon.

Flynncove soils occur along drainageways and have an argillic horizon.

Tridell soils occur on steep escarpments and are loamy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, low and medium runoff, moderate permeability in the upper part and rapid permeability below 4 feet.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major uses are rangeland, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  Potential native vegetation is mountain big sagebrush, needleandthread, antelope bitterbrush, and western wheatgrass.  These soils have been correlated to Mountain Loam (Mountain Big Sagebrush) - 047CY430UT in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Utah.  LRR E, MLRA 47.  This series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Uintah County, Uintah Area Soil Survey, Utah. 1998.  The name is coined from nearby geographic locale Diamond Gulch.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (Bk1 through C1 horizons.)
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 9 inches.  (A1, A2 horizons)
Calcic horizon:  The zone from 9 to 34 inches.  (Bk1, Bk2, Bk3 horizons)

The upper 6 inches after mixing is not calcareous.

Diagulch was reclassified to Typic Haploborolls from Aridic Haploborolls in 6/96.
Classification was changed from Typic Haploborolls to frigid, Tyic Haplustolls 12/98.

The cation exchange activity class was inferred from laboratory data from similar soils in the Uintah Area Soil Survey.
