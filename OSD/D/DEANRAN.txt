DEANRAN SERIES

The Deanran series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks.  The Deanran soils are on mountain back slopes.  Slopes are 50 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid, shallow Aridic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Deanran very bouldery sandy loam--woodland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is covered with 15 percent boulders, 5 percent stones and 5 percent with cobbles.

    A--0 to 10 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very bouldery sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine and medium, few coarse roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 10 percent boulders and 35 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 15 cm thick)

    Bt--10 to 20 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly sandy clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and medium, few coarse roots; common very fine interstitial and few fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on ped faces; 35 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt irregular boundary.  (10 to 20 cm thick)

    Cr--20 to 53 cm; weathered granitic rock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Washoe County, Nevada; in the Granite Range about 2,400 feet north and 700 feet west of the southeast corner of section 35, T. 34 N., R. 22 E.; USGS The Banjo 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 47 minutes 22 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 27 minutes 02 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.7894444 latitude, -119.4505556 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist winter, spring and early summer, usually dry mid July through mid-October; aridic soil moisture regime that borders on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 6 to 8 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 18 to 36 cm.
Depth to weathered bedrock: 18 to 36 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  Averages 15 to 23 percent.
Rock fragments:  35 to 60 percent, over one-half of which are 2 to 5 mm diameter gravel.

A horizon
Chroma:  2 or 3.

Bt horizon
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Texture:  Sandy loam or sandy clay loam.
Clay content:  18 to 25 percent.
Rock fragments:  35 to 60 percent, over one-half of which are 2 to 5 mm diameter gravel.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Dotsolot, Garnel, Lyra, Pinut and Poisoncreek series.  

Dotsolot and Pinut soils are deeper than 36 cm. Lyra and Poisoncreek soils have more than 23 percent clay in the argillic horizon. Garnel soils are moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative due to convection storms between July and September. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Deanran soils are on mountain back slopes.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks.  Slopes are 50 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 1,650 to 2,445 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360, mean annual temperature is 5 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 60 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the proposed Arcamp series.  Arcamp soils do not have a Mollic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; very rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Utah juniper, bluebunch wheatgrass, mountain big sagebrush, desert snowberry, and Thurber needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive. MLRA 23.
