DRYMESA SERIES

The Drymesa series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and eolian deposits over residuum weathered from calcareous sandstone and shale.  Drymesa soils are on structural benches.  Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 267 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8.5 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Pacon(T) (UT) Petaca (NM), Pinon (NM), Shalako (UT), and Wayneco (UT)series. 
Pacon:  averages greater than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section
Petaca:  has hue yellower than 7.5YR
Pinon:  averages greater than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section
Shalako:  has hue yellower than 7.5YR
Wayneco:  has mean annual soil temperature higher than 11 degrees C. (52 degrees F.)

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium and eolian deposits over residuum derived from calcareous sandstone and shale, principally from the Jurassic-age Entrada and Curtis Formations.
Landform:  structural benches
Slopes:  3 to 15 percent
Elevation:  1,524 to 2,225 meters
Mean annual temperature:  7.0 to 10.0 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation:  229 to 305 mm
Precipitation pattern:  The soil moisture control section is affected by precipitation that peaks from July to October and the driest months are December and June.
Frost-free period:  120 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Thumbrock, Mido and Smithpond (T) series.  The Thumbrock soils are moderately deep over a lithic contact.  The Mido soils are very deep, have a sandy particle-size control section and are on dunes.  The Smithpond soils are very deep over a lithic contact.  All of these soils occur under fourwing saltbush and other shrubs and grasses.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, medium runoff, moderately rapid permeability, high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Grazing and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation consists of Utah juniper, pinyon pine, Mormon-tea, fourwing saltbush, Indian ricegrass, blue grama and salina wildrye.  Utah correlates this soil to Semidesert Shallow Sandy Loam (Utah Juniper-Pinyon) RO34XY239UT ecological site.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Emery County, Utah, Emery Area, Utah, 2011.  Parts of Emery, Carbon, Grand, and Sevier soil survey area.   Named for Dry Mesa, about 3 miles southeast of the type location. This series was proposed as a cooler counterpart to the Wayneco series.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 35 cm.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 0 to 35 cm.  (A, Bw, Bk and BCk horizons)
Calcic horizon:  The zone from 15 to 35 cm (Bk and BCk horizons)
Lithic contact:  The contact with sandstone at 35 cm.  (R horizon)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
