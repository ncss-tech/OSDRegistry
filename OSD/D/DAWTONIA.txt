DAWTONIA SERIES

The Dawtonia series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium.  Dawtonia soils are on mountains, foothills and fan terraces and have slopes of 1 to 50 percent. Permeability is moderately slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Xeric Calciargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Dawtonia very gravelly loam on a north facing smooth slope of 21 percent in rangeland at 6,600 feet elevation.  The profile was moist throughout when described on July 5, 1977.  (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated)

    A--0 to 4 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; 40 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 7 inches thick)

    Bt--4 to 12 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 40 percent pebbles, 10 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)

    Bk--12 to 24 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent (20 percent calcium carbonate); 40 percent pebbles, 10 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 14 inches thick)

    Bkq1--24 to 37 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent (12 percent calcium carbonate); common thin lime and silica coatings and pendants on the underside of rock fragments; 50 percent pebbles, 10 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 22 inches thick)

    Bkq2--37 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely gravelly loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable; nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; slightly effervescent (2 percent calcium carbonate); common thin lime and silica coatings and pendants on the underside of rock fragments; 50 percent pebbles, 10 percent cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dawtonia soils are on nearly level to steep fan terraces, foothills and mountain sides.  Slopes range from 1 to 50 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,000 to 7,200 feet.  The soil formed in slope alluvium.  The climate is semiarid with cold moist winters and cool dry summers.  The average annual precipitation is 8 to 11 inches, the average annual air temperature is 37 to 43 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 65 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bregar, Dacont, and Parkay.  Bregar soils are less than 20 inches deep to bedrock.  Dacont and Parkay soils have mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for range.  Vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, salmon wildrye and Sanberg bluegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East central Idaho.  The series is moderately extensive.
