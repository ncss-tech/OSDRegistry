DRYPOK SERIES

The Drypok series consists of moderately deep, well excessively drained soils formed in ash over residuum from tuffs. These soils occur on ridges and mountain sideslopes.  Slopes are 5 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy, glassy, frigid Humic Vitrixerands

TYPICAL PEDON: Drypok ashy sandy loam, upland forest. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

        Oi--0 to 1 inches; slightly decomposed litter of ponderosa pine needles.

        A--1 to 4 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) ashy sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; strong thin to medium platy structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine vesicular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick)

        AB--4 to 13 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) ashy sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium platy structure that parts to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 10 inches thick)

        Bw--13 to 24 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) ashy sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4), clear smooth boundary. (10 to 15 inches thick)

        2Cr--24 to 34 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) weathered rhyolite, with common very fine and fine roots in cracks..
