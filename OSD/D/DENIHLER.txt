DENIHLER SERIES

Denihler series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and glacial till derived from metamorphic rocks. Denihler soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 450 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Denihler cobbly loam--rangeland.  The soil surface is covered with loose twigs and leaf litter. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     Oi--0 to 5 cm; slightly decomposed plant material composed of loose leaf litter and twigs; abrupt smooth boundary.

     Oe--5 to 12 cm; moderately decomposed plant material composed of matted leaf litter and twigs; abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 12 cm combined thickness)

     A1--12 to 15 cm; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) very fine sandy loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate thick platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary. 

     A2--15 to 40 cm; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) cobbly loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 13 percent gravels, 15 percent cobbles, and 4 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (18 to 35 cm combined thickness)

     Bw--40 to 80 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) cobbly sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; 15 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.1); abrupt smooth boundary. (15 to 60 cm thick)

     C--80 to 150 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely cobbly sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; 20 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles, and 20 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Elko County, Nevada about 2.5 miles up Lamoille Canyon from Powerhouse picnic area in the Ruby Mountains; about 420 feet south and 770 feet east of the northwest corner section 16, T. 32 N., R. 58 E.; USGS Lamoille 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 39 minutes 47.03 seconds N and longitude 115 degrees 27 minutes, 2.99 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees latitude 40.6630639, longitude -115.4508306.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist late fall through spring, dry in summer through mid-fall; moist in all parts for more than 120 days following the winter solstice; typic xeric soil moisture regime.

Mollic epipedon thickness: 18 to 40 cm thick.
Cambic horizon thickness: 15 to 60 cm thick. 
Depth to unconsolidated parent material: 33 to 100 cm.
Reaction: neutral or slightly acid. 

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 18 to 27 percent.
Rock fragments: Averages 35 to 60 percent, mainly subangular and angular rock fragments.

COMPETING SERIES:  COMPETING SERIES:  These are Bergquist, Bigarm, Bradshaw, Brunzell, Cupine, Denihler, Fuego, Mud Springs, Potamus, Priver, St. Marys, and Warshod series.

Bergquist, Denihler, Potamus, St. Marys, and Warshod soils are deep. Cupine, Fuego, and Mud Springs soils are moderately deep. Priver soils are shallow. Bergquist, Bigarm, Bradsahaw, Cupine, Fuego, Priver and Warshod soils average less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. 
Potamus soils average greater than 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Denihler soils are on backslopes mountains.  These soils formed in colluvium and glacial till derived from metamorphic and similar rocks.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 2,135 to 2,650 meters. The climate is cool, semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers interrupted by isolated rain storms. The mean annual precipitation is 410 to 500 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C. The frost-free season is 50 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hackwood, Sumine, Rozara, Cucamungo and Inpendence series.  Hackwood soils are Pachic and average less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section. Sumine soils have an argillic horizon. Rozara soils have a lithic contact between 25 to 35 cm.  Inpendence soils have an umbric epipedon and additional soil moisture supplied by lateral water movement in the lower control section or substratum.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat excessively drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately rapid saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat. Present vegetation is mainly curlleaf mountainmahogany, mountain big sagebrush, common chokecherry, basin wildrye, and snowberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Nevada. MLRA 25. These soils are not extensive.
