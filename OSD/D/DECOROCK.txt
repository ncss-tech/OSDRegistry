DECOROCK SERIES

The Decorock series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed igneous and shale alluvium over residuum derived from Mancos Shale.  Decorock soils are on paleoterraces.  Slopes range from 20 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.   

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  igneous alluvium over residuum derived from Mancos shale
Landform:  risers of strath terraces and remnant terraces
Slopes:  20 to 50 percent
Elevation:  4,700to 5,700 feet
Mean annual temperature:  52 to 56 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation:  7 to 10 inches
Precipitation pattern:  uniform with slight dip in May and June and slight increase in July and August
Frost-free period:  135 to 160 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Salamander, Persayo, Greycap, and Gypsey series.  The Salamander soils are very deep and are on treads of strath terraces and remnant terraces.  The Persayo soils are shallow, the Gypsey soils are moderately deep, and both series are on pediments.  Greycap soils are very shallow and are on structural benches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, very high runoff, slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The Decorock soils are used for rangeland.  Native vegetation is galleta, Indian ricegrass, Gardners saltbush, and shadscale.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Montezuma County, Colorado, Ute Mountain Ute Reservation. MLRA 35. This series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Phoenix, Arizona. 

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Montezuma County, Colorado, Ute Mountain Area, Colorado and New Mexico, 2005.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 59 inches.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 26 to 46 inches.  (Bty horizon)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 7 inches.  (A and BA horizons)
Argillic horizon:  The zone from 26 to 58 inches.  (Bty horizon)
Gypsic horizon:  The zone from 15 to 30 inches.  (Bty horizon)
Paralithic contact:  The contact with soft Mancos Shale at 58 inches.  (2Cr horizon)

This soil does not have a calcic horizon because no horizon has 5 percent or more visible carbonates, and no horizon has a calcium carbonate equivalent that is 5 percent or more higher than that of an underlying horizon.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  A HACH kit was used to determine gypsum concentrations. A portable EC meter was used for electrical conductivity. Calcium carbonate equivalence was determined using a field volume calcimeter.
