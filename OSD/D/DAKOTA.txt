DAKOTA SERIES

The Dakota series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of loamy alluvium and in the underlying sandy outwash.  These soils are on outwash plains, stream terraces, and valley trains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 870 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Dakota County, Minnesota, 1941. 

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 36 to 79 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from surface of soil to a depth of 36 centimeters (Ap and A horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 36 to 79centimeters (Bt1, Bt2 and 2Bt3 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

The base saturation in the sandy outwash has increased due to fertilization and liming. 

Cation-exchange activity class is based on lab data from NSSL, Lincoln, Nebraska.

Taxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, tenth edition, 2006.

The responsibility of the Dakota series was transferred from Minnesota to Wisconsin in June 1978, since pedons sampled in Minnesota did not have evidence of an argillic horizon. Data from Dakota pedons in Wisconsin indicate the presence of an argillic horizon.
