SERIES ESTABLISHED: King George County, Virginia, 1970.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to 10 inches (A and E horizons).
Argillic horizon--The zone from 10 to 47 inches (Bt horizon).
Aquic conditions--periodic saturation and reduction in a zone from 20 to 200 inches of the soil surface at some time during the year (endosaturation)

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Laboratory Data: Characterization data are available from NRCS-Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE (Lab Pedon Number=88P0669; User Pedon ID=88NC169002). This pedon has slightly less clay in the particle-size control section than required for the series family placement.
