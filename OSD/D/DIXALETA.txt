DIXALETA SERIES

The Dixaleta series consists of very shallow, well drained soils developed in alluvium and colluvium from schist.  Dixaleta soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 5 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 68 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, thermic, shallow Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Dixaleta extremely channery sandy loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 1 inch; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely channery sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 70 percent channers; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick)

    Bw--1 to 8 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely channery sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 80 percent channers; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (2 to 8 inches thick)

    2Cr--8 to 27 inches; highly fractured and partially weathered schist; variegated; very few fine roots; many calcium carbonate coatings in joints. (17 to 49 inches thick)

    2R--27 inches; schist; common thin coatings of calcium carbonate in joints.

TYPE LOCATION:  Maricopa County, Arizona; 650 feet south and 400 feet west of the northeast corner of section 14, T. 6 N., R. 2 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during December-February and for more than 20 days cumulative during July-September.  Driest during May and June.  Typic aridic soil moisture regime.

Rock fragments:  40 to 80 percent channers throughout

Depth to paralithic contact:  3 to 10 inches

Depth to lithic contact: 20 to 60 inches

A horizon

Chroma: 3 through 6 dry, 2, 3, or 4 moist
Organic matter:  Less than 1 percent

Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 3 through 6, dry or moist
Texture:  sandy loam, loam, clay loam (12 to 30 percent clay)

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Antares (AZ), Lavabed (CA), Seanna (NV), Shankba (NV), and Xyzoic (CA) series. Antares, Lavabed, Seanna, Shankba, and Xyzoic soils are in the Mohave Desert (MLRA 30), receive mostly winter precipitation and are usually dry from April through November.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dixaleta soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 5 to 70 percent.  They formed in alluvium and colluvium from schist.  Elevation is 1,800 to 3,800 feet.  Mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches occurring as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rain.   Mean annual air temperature is 66 to 70 degrees F.  Frost-free period is about 220 to 270 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Anthony, Arizo, Eba, Pinaleno and Vado soils.  Anthony, Arizo and Vado soils are very deep and coarse-loamy, sandy-skeletal and loamy-skeletal respectively.  Eba and Pinaleno soils are very deep and have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing.  Vegetation is brittlebush, creosotebush, staghorn cholla, ironwood, ocotillo, saguaro, paloverde, barrel cactus, jojoba, triangle bursage, prickly pear and annual grasses and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Arizona. This soil occurs in LRR-D, MLRA 40. The series is moderately extensive.
