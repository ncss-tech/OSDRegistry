DUTTON SERIES

The Dutton series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine materials or residuum from semiconsolidated shale or interbedded shale and sandstone.  These soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Torrertic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Dutton silty clay loam, in cropland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 6 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and very fine granular structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many unstained sand and silt grains; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary.

COMPETING SERIES:  These area the Ethridge, Linnet, Patouza, and Sofia series. These soils are very deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Dutton soils are on fan terraces and glaciated outwash plains.  Elevations are 2,400 to 4,300 feet.  These soils formed in lacustrine materials or in residuum from semiconsolidated shale or interbedded shale and sandstone.  The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; cool, moist springs; and short, dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 105 to 135 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well-drained; medium runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Dutton soils are used mainly for nonirrigated cropland and rangeland.  The potential native vegetation is mainly western wheatgrass, green needlegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, forbs, and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East of the Rocky Mountains in northern Montana.  The soils are moderately extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Power-Dutton Project in Teton County, Montana, 1938.  Type location changed to Cascade County, Montana.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT0091.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches (Ap, Bt horizons mixed); an argillic horizon from 6 to 14 inches (Bt horizon); a particle-size control section from 6 to 14 inches (Bt horizon); and a paralithic contact at 36 inches.  Dutton soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.
