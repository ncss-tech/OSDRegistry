 Bg2--99 to 130 cm (39 to 51 inches): dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay loam; common medium and coarse distinct brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) and yellow (10YR 7/6) masses of iron accumulation; common medium distinct dark gray (10YR 4/1) iron depletions; weak coarse and very coarse prismatic structure; friable; neutral: gradual smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bg horizons is 61 to 94 cm, 24 to 37 inches thick).

 Cg--130 to 203 (51 to 80 inches): light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silty clay loam: few to common distinct strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) masses of iron accumulation; few fine faint light gray (10YR 7/1) iron depletions; massive; friable; neutral.

TYPE LOCATION: Tipton County, Tennessee; 1.4 miles north of Gift Grocery on Locust Bluff Road and 275 feet east in a farm field. Approximately 35 degrees 34 minutes 20.66 seconds North Latitude and 89 degrees 33 minutes 35.0 seconds West Longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Solum thickness is more than 122 cm (48 inches)
Depth to bedrock is more than 150 centimeters (60 inches)
Reaction ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.

Range of individual horizons:
A horizon(s):
Color: Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y, value: 3 or less, chroma: 3 or less
Some pedons have an overwash layer 15cm to 38cm (6 to 15 in) thick that has hue of 10YR, value 4, and chroma 2 of 3 or 4.
Texture: silt loam or silty clay loam.

Ab horizon (where present)
Color: Hue: 10YR, value: 2 or 3, chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: silt loam or silty clay loam.

Bg horizon: 
Color: Hue: 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, 5GY, 5G or N, value: 3 to 6, chroma: 2 or less 
Redoximorphic features in shades of brown or yellow 
Texture: silt loam or silty clay loam. 
Some pedons have few to common dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) or Very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) Krotavinas 3 to 7 cm in diameter

Bgb or BCb (where present):
Color: Hue: 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, value: 3 to 6, chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: silt loam or silty clay loam.
Redoximorphic features: shades of olive, brown, or gray
Krotavinas (where present) similar to Bg

Cg horizon (where present):
Color: Hue: 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, value: 4 to 6, chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or very fine sandy loam
Redoximorphic features: shades of olive, brown, or gray

COMPETING SERIES: 
There are no competing soils in the same family. Soils in similar families are:
Reelfoot soils - have argillic horizons and slightly better drainage.
Roellen soils - are fine textured and have vertic soil properties.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landscape: Lower Southern Mississippi Valley Loess
Landform: Depressional areas on flood plains
Hillslope position: Flood plain depressions
Elevation (type location): 91.4 meters (300 feet)
Mean annual temperature range:  15 to 18 degrees C. (59 to 65 degrees F.)
Mean annual precipitation range:  1,143 to 1,397 millimeters (45 to 55 inches)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Dowellton soils-do not have mollic epipedons and also have argillic horizons
Reelfoot soils-have mollic epipedons, have argillic horizons and occur on slightly higher elevations on the landscape
Roellen soils-have a mollic epipedon and have finer textures throughout
Routon soils-lack a mollic epipedon and have argillic horizons 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class: Poorly drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: moderate 
Flooding and ponding: Most Map units are flooded for some part of the growing season
Flooding frequency and duration: Rarely flooded for brief duration at the type location

USE AND VEGETATION: Hardwoods - chiefly oaks, beech, maple, ash, hickory, gum, elm, sycamore, willow, and cypress. Most areas are cleared and used for crops and pasture. Principal crops are corn, soybeans, and hay. Yields generally are high.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Kentucky and Tennessee, possibly Arkansas.
Extent is moderate, with estimated total acreage of 25,000.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Dyer County, Tennessee, 1963.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - 0 to 56 centimeters (0 to 22 inches, Ap and A horizons).
Cambic horizon - 56 to 130 centimeters (22 to 60 inches, Bg1 and Bg2 horizons).
Aquic soil moisture regime.

This revision relocates the type location pedon from Henderson County, KY (a mesic temperature area) to Tipton County, TN (thermic area) and also updates the drainage class from very poorly to poorly drained.
