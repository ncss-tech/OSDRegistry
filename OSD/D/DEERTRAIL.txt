DEERTRAIL SERIES

The Deertrail series consists of deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in eolian or alluvial material.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on upland tablelands or intermediate areas between uplands and lower run-on areas.  Slopes range from 0 to about 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Ustic Natrargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Deertrail loam - grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

  A--0 to 3 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak moderate subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; soft, very friable; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 4 inches thick)

  E--3 to 5 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak thin platy structure parting to weak fine granular; slightly hard, very friable; vesicular; uncoated sand grains; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 3 inches thick)

  Bt--5 to 10 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clay, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; strong medium columnar structure parting to strong fine angular blocky; extremely hard, firm, very plastic; thick continuous clay films on peds; slightly alkaline; (pH 7.4); ESP 4 percent; clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 6 inches thick)

  Btn-10 to 18 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) heavy clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine prismatic structure parting to moderate fine angular and subangular blocky; extremely hard, firm, very plastic; thin continuous clay films on peds; calcareous; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); ESP 18 percent; gradual smooth boundary.  (3 to 13 inches thick)

  BCk2--18 to 23 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; thin patchy clay films; a moderate k and z horizon with secondary accumulation of soluble salts as concretions and crystals; calcareous; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); ESP 16 percent; gradual wavy boundary.  (3 to 13 inches thick)

  Ck--23 to 34 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; hard, friable; a moderate k and z horizon with secondary soluble salt accumulation mostly as concretions and crystals; calcareous; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); ESP 15 percent; gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 15 inches thick)

  Ckz--34 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable; a weak k and z horizon with secondary soluble salt accumulation mostly as concretions and crystals; calcareous; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); ESP 8 percent.

COMPETING SERIES: 
A current competitor is the Winnett series.
Winnett soils have 35 to 50 percent clay in the particle size control section 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent Material: eolian or alluvial material 
Landform: nearly level or slightly depressed intermediate areas between uplands and run-on areas and sloping eolian mantled upland table lands 
Slope: 0 to 6 percent 
Mean annual temperature: 50 degrees F 
Mean annual precipitation: 13 to 15 inches 
Precipitation pattern: 9 inches falling during the months of April through September 
Frost free Period: 130 to 160 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Adena, Arvada, Baca, Campo, Colby, and Weld soils.
All except Arvada soils lack natric horizons.
Arvada soils have an ESP of greater than 15 percent in the upper Bt.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage: well drained 
Runoff: low 
Permeability: slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used generally for grazing; they are occasionally tilled to dryland crops with poor success.  Crop and native grass growth is usually spotted.  The dominant vegetation is western wheatgrass, buffalo grass, blue grama, and red threeawn.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Colorado.  This series is of moderate extent.
