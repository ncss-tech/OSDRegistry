DUGCHIP SERIES

The Dugchip series consists of moderately deep to duripan, well drained soils that formed in loess and volcanic ash over alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  The Dugchip soils are on fan piedmont remnants. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  .

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dugchip soils are on fan piedmont remnants.  These soils formed in loess and volcanic ash over alluvium derived from mixed rocks, including igneous and sedimentary rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 1,280 to 1,770 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 90 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Adelaide, Bliss, Enko and Rebel series.  Adelaide soils are shallow to duripan.  Bliss soils lack natric horizons.  Enko and Rebel soils have cambic horizons and lack duripans.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow or medium runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Irrigated cropland, rangeland and wildlife habitat.   The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, spiny hopsage, Thurber needlegrass, Indian ricegrass, Sandberg bluegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail and rabbitbrush.  Irrigated areas presently grow small grains, potatoes and alfalfa hay.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North central Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 24.
