DERWELL SERIES

The Derwell series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  The Derwell soils are on outwash fans and fan terraces.  Permeability is moderate over very rapid.  Slopes are 1 to 6 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Durinodic Xeric Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Derwell gravelly very fine sandy loam--on a 1 percent smooth, south aspect at 6,560 feet elevation in rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on August 7, 1985, the soil was dry throughout.)

    A--0 to 2 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly very fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 15 percent pebbles; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick)

    Bk1--2 to 9 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very fine sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 10 percent pebbles; few lime coatings less than 1 mm thick on undersides of some coarse fragments; violently effervescent, moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick)

    Bk2--9 to 15 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) sandy loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; moderate medium platy structure; hard, firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and few medium roots on structure plates; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; 10 percent pebbles; few lime coatings less than 1 mm thick on undersides of some coarse fragments; violently effervescent, slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick)

    Bkq1--15 to 27 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly sandy loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; moderate thick platy structure; hard, brittle or firm with 10 percent of horizon friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots in fractures; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; 10 percent pebbles; 25 percent strongly cemented durinodes; krotovinas 4 to 6 inches in diameter filled with root mats and finer material; violently effervescent, slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual wavy boundary. (5 to 15 inches thick)

    Bkq2--27 to 38 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly fine sandy loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; 15 percent pebbles; few lime coatings less than 1 mm thick on undersides of some coarse fragments; 10 percent strongly cemented durinodes; violently effervescent; neutral (pH 7.3); gradual wavy boundary. (5 to 15 inches thick)

    Bkq3--38 to 45 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) gravelly fine sandy loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 30 percent pebbles; lime and minor silica coatings 1 mm thick on undersides of coarse fragments; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary. (5 to 15 inches thick)

    2Bkq4--45 to 60 inches; multicolored extremely gravelly sand; single grain; loose; many fine interstitial pores; 65 percent pebbles; lime and minor silica coatings 1 mm thick on undersides of coarse fragments; krotovinas 4 to 6 inches in diameter filled with root mats and finer material; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Derwell soils are on outwash fans and fan terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium.  Slopes are 1 to 6 percent. Elevations are 5,000 to 6,800 feet.  The climate is cold and moist in winter and spring and dry in summer.  Average annual precipitation is 8 to 11 inches.  Average summer temperature is 60 to 62 degrees F. Average annual temperature is 37 to 44 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 45 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Packmo and Zer soils.  Packmo soils are on outwash fans and fan terraces and have loamy-skeletal control sections.  Zer soils are on mountains and fan terraces and have loamy-skeletal control sections.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Slow runoff; moderate over very rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland.  The natural vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central Idaho.  These soils are not extensive.
