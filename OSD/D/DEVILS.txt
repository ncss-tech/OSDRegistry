DEVILS SERIES

The Devils series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on plateaus. They formed in residuum and local alluvium from andesite.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C. and the mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm.

Reaction:  Neutral or slightly acid

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 27 to 35 percent.
Rock fragments:  35 to 60 percent; mostly gravel with 10 to 20 percent cobbles and stones.

A horizons
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Structure:  Platy or granular.

B2t horizons
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR.

COMPETING SERIES:   These are the Belate, Burnborough, Closkey, Gowjai, Granpeak, Jivas, Millan, Sumine, and Torro series.  
Belate, Burnborough, Millan and Torro soils lack bedrock within 152 cm. Closkey soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Gowjai Granpeak and Jivas soils are 100 to 150 cm to bedrock. Sumine soils lack a paralithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:   Devils soils are on plateaus and have convex surfaces. Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in residuum and local colluvium from basic igneous rocks.  Elevations are 2,400 to 2,900 meters.  The mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm.  Frost-free season is 80 to l00 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:   These are the Fulstone Variant and Glean soils. Fulstone Variant soils have a duripan and an argillic horizon with more than 35 percent clay.   Glean soils are very deep, lack an argillic horizon and have a mollic epipedon more than 50 cm thick.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:   Well drained; slow or medium runoff; slow permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:   Livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Native vegetation is low sagebrush, Nevada bluegrass, and western needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:   Western Nevada.  The soils are not extensive. MLRA 26.
