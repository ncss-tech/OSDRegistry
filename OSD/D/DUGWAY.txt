DUGWAY SERIES

The Dugway series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed volcanic rocks and influenced by volcanic ash.  Dugway soils are on remnant lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dugway soils are on remnant lake terraces.  They formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed volcanic rocks and influenced by volcanic ash. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,620 to 1,830 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual air temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Langston and Updike soils.  Langston soils lack silica cementation and are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Updike soils lack silica cementation.

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 150 and 180 cm (very deep free water occurrence class) between January and September.  Cumulative annual duration class is Persistent.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Dugway soils are used for rangeland.  The present vegetation is dominantly basin big sagebrush, rubber rabbitbrush, and basin wildrye.  Some areas have been seeded to adapted rangeland grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 23.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California.
