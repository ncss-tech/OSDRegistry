DRUM SERIES

The Drum series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from lacustrine deposits.  Drum soils are on lake plains, basin floors, remnant stream terraces, and flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, active, mesic Sodic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Drum loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 6 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium platy structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine and few coarse roots; many fine and very fine vesicular pores; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 7 inches thick)

    Bk1--6 to 11 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak thin platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine and few medium roots; many fine and very fine random tubular and interstitial pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 13 inches thick)

    Bk2--11 to 20 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine random tubular pores; very strongly effervescent, strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 18 inches thick)

    C1--20 to 29 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) light silty clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and very fine roots; few random tubular pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear smooth boundary, (9 to 25 inches thick)

    C2--29 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) silty clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; few fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5)

TYPE LOCATION:  Millard County, Delta Area, Utah; approximately 3 1/2 miles west and 4 miles south of Holden-Meadow junction on U26, IN THE SW  OF THE NE  of Section 1, T.20S., R.6W, 39 degrees, 6 minutes 19 seconds north and 112 degrees, 28 minutes, 26 seconds west (39.1053N, 112.4739W), The Sink USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle, NAD83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry; typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 51 to 54 degrees F.
Mean summer soil temperature: 69 to 72 degrees F.

A horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y.
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 1 to 3.  
Reaction: Moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline.

Bk and C horizons: 
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y.
Value: 7 or 8 dry, 4 to 7 moist.
Chroma: 1 to 4, but dominantly 2 or 3.  
Texture: Loam to silty clay loam, with occasional thin lenses of gravel in some pedons.
Clay content: 18 to 35. 
Sand content: Less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.
Reaction: Moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline.
Effervescence: strongly effervescent to violently effervescent.
Salinity: EC ranges from 16 to 32 mmhos/cm unless reclaimed.
Sodicity: SAR ranges from 13 to 30 unless reclaimed.
Redoximorphic features: Relict redoximorphic features may be present in the C horizon and are inherited from lacustrine sediments.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Drum soils are on nearly level or gently sloping old lake plains, basin floors and bottoms, remnant stream terraces, and flood plains at elevations 4,200 to 5,220 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Parent materials are alluvium derived dominantly from lacustrine deposits.  The climate is arid, the mean annual temperature ranges from 48 to 52 degrees F., the mean summer temperature ranges from 70 to 73 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 110 to 140 days.  Average annual precipitation is 6 to 8 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Abbott, Escalante, and Yuba soils.  Abbott soils have distinct or prominent mottles above depth of 20 inches, or have chroma of 1 or less, and have more than 35 percent clay.  Escalante soils have less than 18 percent clay in their control section.  Yuba soils have more than 36 percent clay and have salic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained; low runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used as rangeland.  The native vegetation is mainly rabbitbrush, greasewood, shadscale, and halogeton.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West-central Utah.  These series are not extensive.  MLRA 28A.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Box Elder County (Eastern Part), Utah, 1969.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: The zone from soil surface to 6 inches. (A horizon)
Calcic horizon: The zone from 6 to 20 inches. (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)

The active cation exchange activity class was added to the taxonomic classification in December 2002 based on soil property data.

In Utah this series is correlated with Desert range sites.

The taxonomic classification was changed from Typic Calciorthids to Aquic Haplocalcids in September 1994.  The Aquic Haplocalcids subgroup placement is based on mottling at 29 inches, the plant list, and being moderately well drained.  The drainage class and saturation need to be verified.  This placement should be considered tentative. This reclassification was rescinded on 10/31/2007 after review of the data populated in map units of the Drum series throughout its extent.
