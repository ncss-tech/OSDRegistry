DODGECREEK SERIES

The Dodgecreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils on outwash terraces.  They formed in sandy glacial outwash with a thin mantle of volcanic ash.  Permeability is moderate and moderately rapid in the upper part and rapid and very rapid below.  Slope ranges from 2 to 12 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 40 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dodgecreek soils are on outwash terraces.  Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.  They formed in sandy glacial outwash with a thin mantle of volcanic ash.  Elevations range from 3,000 to 4,900 feet.  The average annual air temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is 35 to 45 inches.  The average frost-free period is 80 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Idamont, Myrtlecreek (T), Pend Oreille, and Snowcreek (T) soils.  Idamont and Pend Oreille soils are on mountains and are ashy over loamy in the control section.  Myrtlecreek and Snowcreek soils are on steeper terraces and escarpments and have less volcanic ash in the surface mantle.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; permeability is moderate and moderately rapid in the upper part and rapid and very rapid below.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for woodland, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  Potential natural vegetation is mainly western hemlock, western redcedar, grand fir, western white pine, western larch, Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine, and Engelmann spruce with an understory of common princes pine, darkwoods violet, dampwoods blueberry, longtube twinflower, myrtle pachystima, pyrola, queencup beadlily, common beargrass, western wintergreen, and western rattlesnake plantain.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Idaho, and possibly northwestern Montana, and northeastern Washington.  Series is not extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Boundary County, Idaho, 2002.

REMARKS:  Classification changed from Andic Dystrochrepts to Andic Dystrudeps in 2000 due to revision of Soil Taxonomy.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from the mineral soil surface to 7 inches (A and Bw1 horizons)

Cambic horizon - the zone from 3 to 14 inches (Bw1, Bw2, and 2BC1 horizons)

Volcanic ash mantle - the zone from 2 to 10 inches (A, Bw1, Bw2 horizons)

Particle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches (2BC1, 2BC2, and part of the 2C1 horizon)
