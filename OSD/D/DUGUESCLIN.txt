DUGUESCLIN SERIES

The Duguesclin series consists of moderately deep to a  duripan, well drained soils on plains, plateaus and mesas.  Duguesclin soils formed in loess.  Permeability is very slow.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Chromic Durixererts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Duguesclin very cobbly clay loam - rangeland at an elevation of 5,440 feet. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.

(5 to 15 inches thick)

    Bq--22 to 33 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots and a root mat at the base of the horizon; common fine and very fine irregular pores; ped faces weakly cemented by silica; few, faint manganese or iron-manganese stains on faces of peds; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary.

    Bqm--33 to 41 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/4) duripan, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; continuous, indurated laminar silica cap (l mm thick) is underlain by weakly cemented material; abrupt broken boundary.  (1 to 18 inches thick)

    2R--41 inches; fractured, basalt

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Duguesclin soils are on plains, plateaus and mesas.  Duguesclin soils are underlain by basalt and developed in loess.  Slopes are 1 to 6 percent.  Elevations range from 5,100 to 5,900   feet.  The average annual precipitation is 13 to 16 inches.  The average annual air temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F. and the frost free period is 70 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Schooler soils on ridges and sideslopes and the Willho soils in broad drainageways and on mounds.   Schooler soils are moderately deep to bedrock and lack a duripan.  Willho soils have an indurated duripan and lack vertic properties.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; runoff is rapid; permeability is very slow.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Duguesclin soils are used for rangeland.  Potential native vegetation is low sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Duguesclin soils are of small extent in south central Idaho.
