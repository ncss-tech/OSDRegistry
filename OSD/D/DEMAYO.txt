DEMAYO SERIES

The Demayo series consists of soils that are shallow to hard basalt bedrock.  They are well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum from basalt lava flows. Demayo soils are on steep ridges and hills on basalt mesas and lava plateaus. Slope ranges from 1 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Lithic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Demayo very cobbly clay loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 5 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) very cobbly clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 10 percent pebbles, 20 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary (5 to 9 inches thick).

    Bw--5 to 12 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) very cobbly clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; 20 percent pebbles, 20 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt irregular boundary (5 to 11 inches thick).

    R--12 inches; hard basalt bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION: Las Animas County, Colorado; approximately 8 miles southeast of Kim, Colorado on the Tecolote Mesa; about 950 feet east and 1,600 feet south of the northwest corner of Sec. 20, T. 33 S., R. 52 W.; Kim South USGS quadrangle; latitude 37 degrees, 09 minutes, 30 seconds north; longitude 103 degrees, 16 minutes, 42 seconds west.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: Ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic. Moist intermittently April through August. Driest December through February.

Mean annual soil temperature:50 to 55 degrees F. 
Thickness of the mollic epipedon:  7 to 20 inches 
Depth to lithic contact: 10 to 20 inches. 
Most pedons are noncalcareous; however, some pedons may have calcium carbonate accumulation on the underside of rock fragments.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Arbol (NM),  Far (AZ), Faraway (AZ), Huachuca (AZ),Rotagilla (NM), and Seralin (NV) series.  Potential competitors were superactive cation exchange activity class assigned areBaller, (CO), Boriana (NM), Docdee (NM), Oro Grande (NM) and Yaquican (AZ) series. 
Arbol soils: has a paralithic contact above the lithic contact and are dry March and April.
Far soils: average less than 18 percent clay in the control section and are dry in May and June.
Faraway soils: average less than 18 percent clay in the control section and are dry in May and June.
Huachuca soils: have secondary carbonates and are dry in May and June.
Rotagilla soils: rock fragments are derived from monzonite and are dominantly gravel size, are dry in March and April.
Saralin soils: average less than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section.
Baller soils: average 5 to 18 percent clay in the control section., 
Boriana soils: average less than 18 percent clay in the control section and are dry in May and June.
Docdee soils: receive significant amounts of winter precipitation
Oro Grande soils: have significant accumulations of calcium carbonate in the control section, and have a calcium carbonate equivalent of 8 to 14 percent.
Yaquican soils: are dry in May and June and have an E horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: Slope alluvium and residuum from basalt.
Landform: Demayo soils are on steep ridges and hills on basalt capped mesas and lava plateaus. 
Slope: 1 to 30 percent. 
Elevation: 5,500 to 7,000 feet 
Mean annual precipitation: 14 to 17 inches
Mean annual temperature: 50 to 53 degrees F. 
Frost-free season: 125 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Apache, Ayon, Eguaje, and Torreon soils. 
Apache soils: calcareous throughout the control section. 
Ayon, Eguaje, and Torreon soils: greater than 60 inches to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; runoff is very high; permeability is moderately slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: Demayo soils are used primarily for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Vegetation is mainly sideoats grama, little bluestem, big bluestem, blue grama, needlegrasses, Gambel oak, true mountainmahogany, pinon, and juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Basalt capped mesas of southeastern Colorado. LRR G, MLRA 70;  the series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES PROPOSED: Las Animas County, Colorado, 1989.  Demayo series is a coined name. It is derived from the Mesa de Mayo, a major landmark in the area. The name is pronounced Da-my-o.
