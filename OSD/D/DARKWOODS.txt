COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils occur on mountains with slopes of 15 to 110 percent at elevations of 19 to 1386 meters (62 to 4547 feet). These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone, schist, and phyllite. The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 1250 to 2032 millimeters (49 to 80 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F). Mean summer temperature is 14 degrees C (58 degrees F) and the mean winter temperature is 7 degrees C (44 degrees F). The mean annual temperature is 9 to 15 degrees C (48 to 59 degrees F). The frost free season is about 150 to 250 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Firmountain, Oakside and Redtop soils. Redtop soils are fine with greater than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section. Firmountain soils are moderately deep, 50 to 100 centimeters to bedrock with fractures less than 10 centimeters apart. Oakside soils are shallow, 25 to 50 centimeters (10 to 20 inches) to bedrock with fractures greater than 10 centimeters apart.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well-drained; high runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for timber production, wildlife habitat and watershed. Native vegetation is Douglas-fir, tanoak, Pacific madrone, salal, poison oak, bracken fern and modesty.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Siskiyou-Trinity Area, MLRA 5. The series is not extensive.
