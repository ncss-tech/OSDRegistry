DAVIDELL SERIES

The Davidell series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or alluvium.  These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans, and sedimentary plains.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Haplargidic Natrustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Davidell silty clay loam, grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    E1--0 to 2 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate thin platy structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many fine irregular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary.

    E2--2 to 4 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak medium angular blocky structure parting to weak medium platy; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (Combined E horizons is 3 to 7 inches thick)

    Bt--4 to 9 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to strong fine angular blocky; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; many faint clay films on faces of peds and in pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (4 to 6 inches thick)

    Bk1--9 to 25 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silty clay loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; weak medium angular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; few fine masses of lime; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.

    Bk2--25 to 38 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silty clay loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; few fine masses of lime; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of Bk horizons is 19 to 55 inches).

    Byz--38 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine pores; few fine masses of gypsum and other salts; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Rosebud County, Montana, 1985.  Origin of name is an abandoned post office in Rosebud County.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT0350.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 4 inches which is also an albic horizon (E1, E2 horizons); an argillic horizon from 4 to 9 inches (Bt horizon); a horizon of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation from 9 to 38 inches (Bk1, Bk2 horizons); a horizon of gypsum and other salt accumulation (Byz horizon).  A particle-size control section from 4 to 40 inches (Bt, BK1, Bk2, Byz horizon).  The Davidell soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
