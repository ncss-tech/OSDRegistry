DUELM SERIES 

The Duelm series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in sandy glacial outwash on outwash plains, stream terraces, and valley trains. These soils have slopes of 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 750 mm. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, frigid Oxyaquic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Duelm loamy sand with a slightly concave slope of less than 1 percent on a stream terrace in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

    Ap--0 to 25 cm; black (10YR 2/1) loamy sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; few very fine roots; about 1 percent gravel; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. (20 to 30 cm thick)

    AB--25 to 41 cm; dark brown (10YR 3/3) loamy sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; neutral; common fine distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4) Fe concentrations; gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 20 cm thick)

    Bw1--41 to 51 cm; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) coarse sand; single grain; loose; many fine prominent reddish brown (5YR 4/4) Fe concentrations; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.

    Bw2--51 to 76 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) coarse sand; single grain; loose; about 3 percent gravel; many medium distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4) Fe concentrations and few fine distinct grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) Fe depletions; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of Bw horizon is 8 to 38 cm)

    C1--76 to 94 cm grayish brown (10YR 5/2) coarse sand; single grain; loose; about 1 percent gravel; common fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) Fe concentrations; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. 

    C2--94 to 203 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) coarse sand; single grain; loose; common fine faint dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) Fe depletions and few fine prominent dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) Fe concentrations; neutral.

TYPE LOCATION: Sherburne County, Minnesota; about 2 miles southeast of St. Cloud, 1300 feet south and 55 feet west of the northeast corner of Sec. 9, T.35N., R. 30 W.,; USGS Cable quadrangle; lat. 45 degrees 32 minutes 28 seconds N. and long. 94 degrees 04 minutes 08 seconds W., NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to free carbonates ranges from 102 to over 203 cm. The series control section averages less than 10 percent rock fragments, but some pedons have strata with as much as 15 percent rock fragments. The series control section has less than 40 percent fine sand and 25 to 75 percent medium sand or coarser. The mollic epipedon thickness ranges from 25 to 50 cm. 

The Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, or coarse sand. It is neutral to moderately acid. 

The AB horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. Textures and reaction are similar to the A horizon.

The Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. A Bg horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. The B horizons typically have faint to prominent Fe depletions in some parts. They are coarse sand, sand, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand. They range from neutral to strongly acid. 

The C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is coarse sand or sand.  It is moderately acid to slightly alkaline. 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Falsen, Flaming, Hecla, Osakis, Radium, and Walum.  Falsen soils have mollic epipedons greater than 51 cm thick. Flaming soils have more than 40 percent fine sand and more than 75 percent passing the No. 40 sieve in the series control section. Hecla soils do not have a B horizon, are dominated by fine sand, and have more than 75 percent passing the No. 40 sieve in the series control section. Osakis soils have carbonates above a depth of 64 cm and have more than 10 percent rock fragments in the lower third of the series control section.  Radium soils average more than 10 percent rock fragments in the series control section. Walum soils have formed in materials containing more than 50 percent shale fragments of sand size. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on plane to slightly concave or convex positions on level to undulating outwash plains, stream terraces, and valley trains. Slope gradients are 0 to 3 percent. The soil formed in Des Moines lobe sandy outwash sediments of Late Wisconsinan Age. Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 3 to 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 635 to 865 mm. Frost-free days range from 120 to 180. Elevation above sea level ranges from 245 to 455 meters. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The Glendorado, Hubbard, and Isan soils form a drainage sequence with the Duelm soils. The Hubbard soils are excessively drained and occupy higher landscape positions. The somewhat poorly drained Glendorado soils and the poorly and very poorly drained Isan soils are on lower landscape positions than the Duelm soils. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is 42.34 to 141.14 micrometers per second (6 to 20 inches per hour). This soil has season high saturation at depths of 51 cm during April to June in years of normal precipitation. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cropped to corn, soybeans, small grains, and hay. Native vegetation is mixed tall prairie grasses and deciduous forest. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA-91B.  Central Minnesota and western Wisconsin. This series is moderately extensive. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Scott County, Minnesota, 1957. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil are: mollic epipedon - from the surface to 41 cm (Ap and AB horizons); aquic subgroup - low chroma redox depletions within 102 cm of the surface. 1/19/2011-TYPE LOCATION error was corrected.

Type location moved from Anoka County, Mn. to Sherburne County, Mn., 11/96 to better exemplify the series concept within the MLRA.
