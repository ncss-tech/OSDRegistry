DEEPWOOD SERIES

The Deepwood series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in unconsolidated material and local alluvial-colluvial valley fill that weathered from sandstone of Permian age. These soils occur on very gently sloping to steep side slopes and base slopes of the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78). Slope ranges from 1 to 30 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 16.1 degrees C (61 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is 635 mm (25 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Deepwood loam, on a 4 percent slope in rangeland, at an elevation of 534 m (1,752 ft).
     (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)
