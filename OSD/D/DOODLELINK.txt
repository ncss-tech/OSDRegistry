DOODLELINK SERIES

The Doodlelink series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium weathered from extrusive igneous rocks and volcanic ash. They are on mountainsides and breaks.  Slopes range from 5 to 75 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 400 mm, and the average annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Ultic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Doodlelink very gravelly loam -- on a north-facing slope of 55 percent under native rangeland at 1,433 elevation.  When described on October 3, l977, the soil profile was dry.  (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise stated.) 

    A--0 to 15 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 50 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (15 to 20 cm thick)

    Bw1--15 to 30 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 50 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (15 to 20 cm thick)

    Bw2--30 to 53 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 50 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (20 to 36 cm thick)

    Bw3--53 to 91 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 70 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (25 to 50 cm thick)

    C--91 to 165 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely gravelly clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 70 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Twin Falls County, Idaho; about 14 miles east of Rogerson; about 340 feet north and 280 feet west of the southeast corner section 36, T. 12 S., R. 18 E.; USGS Grand View Peak 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 42 degrees 19 minutes 52 seconds N and longitude 114 degrees 17 minutes 15 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 42.3311111 latitude, -114.2875000 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist in winter and spring; dry late summer and fall; typic xeric soil moisture regime. 
Mean annual soil temperature: 5 to 8 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 50 to 76 cm.
Base saturation in the upper 76 cm: 55 to 75 percent.  
Depth to bedrock or welded ash: 150 cm or more.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: average 20 to 30 percent.
Rock fragments: Average 40 to 80 percent (mostly gravel).

A horizon
Value: 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma: 1 through 3 dry or moist.
Organic carbon content:  .6 to 2 percent.

Bw1 horizon
Value: 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma: 1 through 3 dry or moist.

Bw2, Bw3 and C horizons
Value: 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 1 through 4 dry or moist.
Textures: Clay loam, sandy loam or loam
Rock fragments: 40 to 80 percent (mostly gravel).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Buckcreek, Gimlett, Lamondi, Moweba, Piersonte, Scoap, and Umatilla series.  Buckcreek soils are 50 to 100 cm deep over bedrock.  Gimlett soils contain less than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Lamondi soils are slightly acid or medium acid.  Moweba soils have 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR hues in the B horizon.  Piersonte soils have O horizons and rock fragments of shale.  Scoap soils have 8 to 12 percent clay in the control section.  Umatilla soils have O horizons and have a dominance of cobbles in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Doodlelink soils are on mountainsides and breaks.  Slopes range from 5 to 75 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and slope alluvium weathered from extrusive igneous rocks and volcanic ash.  Elevations are 1,433 to 2,195 meters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 360 to 500 mm.  The average annual air temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 60 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Amboat, Brose, Congle, Nawt, Oshone, Stricker, and Tucker soils.  Amboat and Brose soils occur on summits.  Amboat soils are clayey-skeletal.  Brose soils are shallow.   Congle soils occur on the same landscape, but are not skeletal.  Nawt and Stricker soils occur on the same landscape, but at lower elevations, are mesic, and are not Pachic.  Oshone soils occur on terraces, are fine and moderately deep to a hardpan.  Tucker soils occur on terraces, are fine and somewhat poorly drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Doodlelink soils are used mainly for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Natural vegetation is Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, and mountain big sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southcentral and southwestern Idaho.  The series is of moderate extent. MLRA 25.
