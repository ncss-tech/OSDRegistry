DINGLE SERIES

The Dingle series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in organic material over lake sediments. These soils are on lakebeds and lake terraces. Permeability is moderately slow. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, euic, frigid Terric Haplosaprists

TYPICAL PEDON: Dingle muck,on a lakebed with a slope of 0 percent at an elevation of 5,900 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Oa1--0 to 6 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) rubbed and pressed muck (sapric material); about 30 percent fiber, about 15 percent rubbed; nonsticky and nonplastic; primarily herbaceous fibers; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual smooth boundary.

    Oa2--6 to 18 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) broken face and rubbed muck (sapric material); black (10YR 2/1) pressed; about 25 percent fiber, about 10 percent rubbed; nonsticky and nonplastic; primarily herbaceous fibers; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual smooth boundary.

    Oa3--18 to 23 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) broken face muck (sapric material); black (10YR 2/1) rubbed; about 30 percent fiber, about 10 percent rubbed; nonsticky and nonplastic; primarily herbaceous fibers; neutral (pH 7.3); gradual smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the Oa horizons is 16 to 30 inches)

    Cg1--23 to 36 inches; very dark gray (2.5Y 3/1) silt loam, dark gray (2.5Y 4/1) dry; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth boundary. (10 to 16 inches thick)

    Cg2--36 to 60 inches; black (5Y 2/1) silt loam, dark gray (2.5Y 4/1) dry; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth boundary.

TYPE LOCATION: Bear Lake County, Idaho; about 1.5 miles west and 1 mile north of Lifton pumping station;   Latitude 42 degrees 8 minutes 13.7 seconds N, Longitude 111 degrees 20 minutes 36.6 seconds W.

Hue - 2.5Y or 5Y
Value - 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry
Chroma - 1 or 2 dry or moist

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Berner, Bullwinkle, Cathro, Nidaros, and Wonsqueak series. The Berner soils have loamy till at 30 to 55 inches, and have sandy sediments between the organic material and the till. The Bullwinkle soils have 15 percent or more wood fragments in the organic material. The Cathro soils are similar but receives 19 to 43 inches mean annual precipitation. The Nidaros soils have A horizons below the organic material and has sandy 2Cg horizons. The Wonsqueak soils do not have free carbonates in the mineral soil, are very strongly acid to neutral in the C horizon, and have a mean annual precipitation of 35 to 55 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform: lakebeds and lake terraces
Elevation: 5,900 to 6,000 feet
Slope: 0 to 2 percent
Parent material: organic material over lake sediments
Climate: long, cool winters; moist springs, and dry, warm summers. 
Average annual precipitation: 12 to 15 inches
Average annual temperature: 39 to 44 degrees F.
Frost-free season: 70 to 100 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bear Lake, Dinswamp (T) and Bloomington (T) series. Bear Lake soils do not have accumulations of organic materials and are on higher landscape positions. Dinswamp soils have organic surfaces 8 to 15 inches thick and are on slightly higher landscape positions. Bloomington soils lack accumulations of organic materials, have a mollic epipedon, and are on low alluvial fans.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained; runoff is slow or very slow; permeability is moderately slow. These soils have a water table two feet above the surface (ponded) to 0.5 feet below the surface at some time from October to July. Ponding is frequent or occasional for brief to very long periods.
USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for wildlife habitat. Vegetation is Bull rush, sedges and cattails.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeast Idaho. These soils are of small extent. MLRA 13.
