DRYFORK SERIES

The Dryfork series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed silty eolian or lacustrine deposits.  These soils are on lake plains and terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, active, frigid Calcic Haploxerepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Dryfork silt loam, in pasture.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 6 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structures; soft, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many fine and few coarse roots; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw--6 to 16 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 7/4) silt loam, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (7 to 12 inches thick)

    Bk1--16 to 23 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 7/4) silt loam, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; disseminated lime, few fine masses of lime; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary.

    Bk2--23 to 31 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) silt loam, pale yellow (2.5Y 7/4) moist; massive, slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; disseminated lime, few fine masses of lime; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bk horizons 6 to 20 inches.)

    C--31 to 60 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) silt loam, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

COMPETING SERIES:

Kerrdam (MT) - have an SAR of less than 13 in the cambic and Bk horizons.

Watercanyon (ID) - are nonsodic throughout the profile.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - lake plains and terraces.
Elevation - 2,500 to 3,000 feet.
Parent material - mixed, silty eolian or lacustrine deposits.
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm, dry summers.
Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 14 inches, much of which falls as snow and spring rains.
Mean annual temperature - 41 to 45 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 105 to 125 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used as irrigated hayland, pastureland and rangeland.  The potential native vegetation is bluebunch wheatgrass, prairie junegrass, and Sandburg bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Dryfork soils are inextensive in mountain valleys of western Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Sanders County, Montana, 1997

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1046.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches (A and Bw horizons); a cambic horizon from 7 to 16 inches (Bw horizon); accumulation of lime from 16 to 31 inches (Bk1 & Bk2 horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bw, Bk1, Bk2, and C horizons).  Dryfork soils have a frigid temperature regime and a xeric moisture regime that borders on aridic.
