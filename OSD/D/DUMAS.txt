DUMAS SERIES

The Dumas series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy eolian sediments of Pleistocene age.  These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping plains of the Southern High Plains, Northern part (MLRA 77A).  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 13 degrees C (55 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm (18 in).

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are mainly cultivated with corn, soybeans, grain sorghum, and winter wheat.  A considerable amount of acreage is irrigated.  Climax vegetation is dominantly short grasses with a few mid-grasses, including blue grama and buffalograss, with lesser amounts of vine-mesquite, western wheatgrass, sideoats grama, galleta, or tobosa, silver bluestem, wild alfalfa, and prairie clover.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  LRR-H; Southern High Plains, Northern Part (MLRA 77A) of the Texas Panhandle.  The soil is also correlated outside MLRA 77A in portions of eastern New Mexico.  This soil is extensive.
