DRYFIELD SERIES

The Dryfield series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone. Dryfield soils are on mountains and ridges. Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 2160 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 14 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, active, thermic Typic Dystroxerepts

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Temperature:  The mean annual soil temperature at 50 centimeters is 15 to 19 degrees C and the difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures is 6 degrees C or greater. The soil has a thermic temperature regime.

Soil Moisture:  The soil moisture control section, in normal years, is dry in all parts for 45 or more consecutive days in the 4 months following the summer solstice and moist in all parts for 45 or more consecutive days in the 4 months following the winter solstice. The soil has a xeric moisture regime.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Kanaka series from Shasta County (1965). Kanaka soils are moderately deep over granodiorite. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dryfield soils are on mountains and ridges.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 100 to 760 meters. The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone of the Franciscan Complex. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1500 to 3050 millimeters. Mean annual temperature is 13 to 15 degrees C. Frost free season is about 240 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Yorknorth, and Witherell soils.  Yorknorth soils contain more than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section. Witherell soils have lithic materials with cracks spaced less than 10 centimeters apart between 25 and 50 centimeters. Yorknorth soils are on concave to linear positions and Witherell soils are on convex positions. 
DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium to high runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used mainly for livestock grazing. The vegetation includes slender oat, wild oat, soft brome, ripgut brome, , bristly dogstail grass, medusa head, silver hairgrass, hairy catsear, common sheep sorrel, and other annual and perennial grasses and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Siskiyou-Trinity Area, MLRA 5. The series is not extensive.
