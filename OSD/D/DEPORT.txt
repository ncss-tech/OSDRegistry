DEPORT SERIES

The Deport series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils
of old terraces and uplands.  They formed in alkaline clayey materials.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, thermic Udic Haplusterts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Deport clay--pasture.
       (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A1--0 to 6 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; few fine faint mottles of grayish brown;
moderate fine subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, very
firm; many fine roots; few quartz pebbles; medium acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (3 to 11 inches thick)

     AC1g--6 to 30 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) clay, dark gray (10YR
4/1) moist; few fine faint mottles of dark grayish brown and
common fine distinct yellowish brown; moderate fine subangular
blocky structure; extremely hard, very firm; few fine roots; few slickensides 2 to 4 inches across that intersect; many pressure faces; few vertical cracks about 1 cm wide filled with dark gray (10YR 4/1); few quartz pebbles; slightly acid; gradual wavy
boundary.  (15 to 30 inches thick)

     AC2g--30 to 37 inches; gray (10YR 6/1) clay, gray (10YR 5/1) moist; few fine faint mottles of yellowish brown and dark grayish brown; moderate fine blocky structure; extremely hard, very firm;
few roots; common intersecting slickensides 2 to 6 inches across;
few dark gray (10YR 4/1) streaks or filled cracks about 1 cm wide; few quartz pebbles; mildly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to
10 inches thick)

     AC3g--37 to 57 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) clay,
olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; common medium faint mottles of yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) and few fine distinct gray; moderate
fine blocky structure; extremely hard, very firm; common
slickensides 1 to 5 inches across that intersect; filled vertical cracks about 1 cm wide, dark gray (10YR 4/1) and gray (10YR 5/1); about 20 percent shale fragments in lower part; moderately
alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 25 inches thick)

     C--57 to 68 inches; stratified brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) and light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) shale, yellowish brown (10YR 5/8)
and grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; medium platy structure;
extremely hard, very firm; few soft bodies of calcium carbonate; moderately a kaline; calcareous.

TYPE LOCATION:  Red River County, Texas; about 100 feet southwest
of the intersection of Texas Highway 37 and county road; 12 miles southwest of Clarksville.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to about
65 inches.  Clay content throughout ranges from 45 to 60 percent.  Few to common intersecting slickensides 2 to 8 inches wide begin
at depths ranging from about 12 to 20 inches below the surface.  Cycles of microdepressions and microknolls are repeated each 4 to
10 feet.  In virgin areas these are expressed as gilgai relief.  Depth to moist values greater then 3.5 range from 0 to 5 inches in the microknolls and 6 to 11 inches in the microdepression.  Depth
to the C horizon ranges from about 40 to 50 inches in the
microknolls to about 50 to 65 inches in the microdepressions.  Calcareous material, where present, follows the wavy upper
boundary of the C horizon but extends in the AC3 in some
microknolls.

The A horizon is dark gray (10YR 4/1) or gray (10YR 5/1) and some pedons contain a few fine mottles of grayish brown or yellowish brown.  It is medium acid through mildly alkaline.

The AC1 horizon is gray (10YR 5/1; 2.5Y N 5/0; 5Y 5/1).  Moist
values are 4 in more than 50 percent of the pedon.  Mottles range from few to many and are faint to distinct in shades of gray,
brown, olive, and yellow.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to
mildly alkaline.  The AC2g and AC3g horizons are gray (10YR 5/1, 6/1), grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2), light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4),
light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2), or light gray (10YR 7/1; 2.5Y 7/2;
5Y 7/2).  Mottles are few to many faint to distinct shades of
gray, brown, olive, or yellow.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid
to moderately alkaline and a few pedons are calcareous below about
30 inches.

The C horizon is light brownish gray, light gray, light olive
gray, light yellowish brown, or brownish yellow with many mottles
of these same colors and olive yellow and reddish yellow.  It is noncalcareous or calcareous shale, shaly clay, or clay that is moderately alkaline and contains a few soft calcium carbonate
bodies.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same
family.  Other soils are the Beaumont, Burleson, Clarita, Eutaw, Ferris, Garner, Hollywood, Houston Black, Lake Charles, Randall,
and San Saba series.  Beaumont, Garner, Hollywood, and Lake
Charles soils are dry for shorter periods of time.  In addition, Beaumont soils are strongly acid in the A and AC horizons.
Burleson, Clarita, Hollywood, Houston Black, Lake Charles,
Randall, and San Saba soils have moist values of less than 3.5 to depths greater than 12 inches.  Eutaw soils are extremely acid in
the A and B horizons and are of a very-fine family.  Ferris soils have chromas greater than 1.5 in the upper 12 inches and are calcareous.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping uplands and old terraces.  Slope gradients are 0 to 5 percent.  The soils formed in alkaline cretaceous shale and marl.  Average annual precipitation at the type location is about 45
inches, average annual temperature is about 64 degrees F., and Thornthwaite P-E index is 76.

Geographicallly Associated Soils:  These include the competing Burleson and Houston Black series and the Bryarly, Panola, and
Wilson series.  Bryarly, Panola, and Wilson soils have argillic horizons.  They are all on similar positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; medium to
rapid runoff; very slow internal drainage; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for pasture.
Native vegetation is grasses, including indiangrass and species of andropogons.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mainly in northeast Texas.  The series
is of moderate extent.

REMARKS:  These soils were formerly classified in the Grumusol
great soil group and included in the Garner series.
