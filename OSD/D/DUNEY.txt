DUNEY SERIES

The Duney series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy eolian deposits over eolian sands on rises of plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 620 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 0.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, isotic over mixed Typic Haplocryods

TYPICAL PEDON: Duney highly organic silt loam, located on a plain rise with a slope of 5 percent and elevation of 24 meters; when described on July 20th, 2010 the soil was moist throughout (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted)

 Oe--0 to 8 centimeters; moderately decomposed plant material; common fine roots, common medium roots, many coarse roots, and many very fine roots; extremely acid, pH 3.7; clear smooth boundary

 A--8 to 11 centimeters; 30 percent brown (7.5YR 4/2) and 70 percent dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) highly organic silt loam; 30 percent sand; 64 percent silt; 6 percent clay; weak medium granular structure; very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common fine roots and common very fine roots; extremely acid, pH 3.7; clear wavy boundary

 Bhs--11 to 18 centimeters; very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) medial highly organic silt loam; 30 percent sand; 64 percent silt; 6 percent clay; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common fine roots, common medium roots, and common very fine roots; extremely acid, pH 4.4; clear smooth boundary

 2Bs--18 to 47 centimeters; 10 percent brown (7.5YR 4/2) and 90 percent dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) fine sandy loam; 60 percent sand; 35 percent silt; 5 percent clay; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; few medium roots; moderately acid, pH 5.7; clear smooth boundary

 2C--47 to 183 centimeters; very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) fine sand; 90 percent sand; 7 percent silt; 3 percent clay; massive structure; very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; moderately acid, pH 5.9
