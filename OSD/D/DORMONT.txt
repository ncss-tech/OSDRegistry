MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: MORGANTOWN, WEST VIRGINIA

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 1973.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 28 cm (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 28 to 157 cm (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and Bt4 horizons)
Redoximorphic depletions with chroma of 2 or less--79 to 191 cm

This revision eliminates colluvium as a parent material for the Dormont series.  Workers involved in recent Soil Survey updates believe this soil is mainly derived from residuum.  Future MLRA update work on this series will include addressing Dormont where historically mapped in colluvial landform positions.
