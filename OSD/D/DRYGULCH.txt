DRYGULCH SERIES

The Drygulch series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in gravelly alluvium. These soils are on stream terraces and inset fans. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Aridic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Drygulch coarse sandy loam, in rangeland on a 1 percent slope at 1,002 meters elevation (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise indicated.)

    A--0 to 25 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) coarse sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; very friable, soft, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots, common medium roots; many fine irregular pores; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (18 to 28 cm thick)

    BC--25 to 33 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable, soft, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and medium roots; common fine irregular pores; 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual smooth boundary. (5 to 25 cm thick)

    C1--33 to 46 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual smooth boundary. (13 to 46 cm thick)

    C2--46 to 152 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) very gravelly loamy coarse sand, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; moderately rapid permeability to a depth of 46 cm and rapid below.

USE AND VEGETATION: Drygulch soils are used mainly for irrigated pasture and hayland, or for dry-land pasture.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Drygulch soils are of small extent in valleys of western Montana. MLRA 44A.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Bitterroot Valley Area, Montana, 2013; proposed in Ravalli County, Montana, 2006.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  
Mollic epipedon - from 0 to 25 cm (A horizon) 
Particle-size control section - from 25 to 100 cm (BC, C1, and part of the C2 horizons)

Drygulch soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
