DOGLAKE SERIES

The Doglake series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that are 20 to 40 inches deep over cobble and gravel.  They formed in alluvium.  These soils are on giant ripple marks.  Slopes are 2 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal over fragmental, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Doglake extremely cobbly loam, forested.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

    A--0 to 4 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely cobbly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many fine and few medium roots; 30 percent pebbles and 50 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)

    Bw1--4 to 12 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely cobbly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak moderate subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; few fine pores; 30 percent pebbles and 55 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual smooth boundary.  (7 to 15 inches thick)

    Bw2--12 to 22 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely cobbly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist, weak moderate subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; few fine pores; 30 percent pebbles and 60 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 18 inches thick)

    2C--22 to 60 inches; 35 percent pebbles and 60 percent cobbles.

TYPE LOCATION:  Sanders County, Montana; 2,300 feet south and 2,850 feet east of the NW corner of sec. 4, T. 20 N., R. 25 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil temperature - 41 to 43 degrees F.
Moisture control section - between 15 and 60 inches.
Depth to fragmental material - 20 to 40 inches but mainly 20 to 36 inches.
The surface when mixed to a depth of seven inches does not meet the requirements of a mollic epipedon.

Reaction:  pH 6.1 to 7.3

Bw1 horizon - Value:  6 or 7 dry; 5 or 6 moist
Clay content:  10 to 18 percent
Rock fragments:  70 to 90 percent - 20 to 30 percent pebbles; 50 to 60 percent cobbles

Reaction:  pH 6.1 to 7.3

2C horizon
Rock fragments:  95 to 100 percent - 35 to 40 percent pebbles; 60 to 70 percent cobbles

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - giant ripple marks
Elevation - 3400 to 3700 feet.
Parent material - alluvium.
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm, dry summers.
Mean annual precipitation - 19 to 21 inches, much of which falls as snow and spring rains.
Mean  annual temperature - 40 to 42 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 70 to 90 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Excessively drained; moderately rapid over very rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used as wildlife habitat, understory grazing and woodland.  The potential native vegetation is an overstory of Douglas fir and ponderosa pine with an understory of bluebunch wheatgrass, rough fescue, kinnikinnick and antelope bitterbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  These soils are of limited extent in northwestern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Sanders County, Montana, 1997.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1176.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  An ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches (A, Bw1 horizons); a cambic horizon from 4 to 22 inches (Bw horizons); fragmental material from 22 to 60 inches (2C horizon); a particle size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bw1, Bw2 and 2C horizons).   Doglake soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
