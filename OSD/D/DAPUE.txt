DAPUE SERIES

The Dapue series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in silty alluvium. They are on nearly level flood plains and low stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches and mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, active, mesic Fluventic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Dapue silt loam - on a 1 percent slope in a fescue pasture at an elevation of 1,090 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated)

COMPETING SERIES: These are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dapue soils are on flood plains and low stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. These soils formed in silty alluvium. Elevations are commonly 700 to 1250 feet. Mean annual temperature ranges from 55 to 58 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bearthicket, Britwater, Cedargap, Pomme, Racket, Razort and Winnipeg soils. The Bearthicket soils lack dark colored surface horizons and are on similar positions. Britwater, Pomme and Winnipeg soils have argillic horizons and lack dark colored surface horizons. Britwater soils are on stream terraces. Pomme and Winnipeg soils are on foot slopes and strath terraces. Cedargap soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section and are on flood plains. Racket soils are on flood plains, have dark colored surfaces more than 24 inches thick and have more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser in the control section. Razort soils are on stream terraces and have dark colored surfaces less than 10 inches thick and more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser in the control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Runoff is very low or low. Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in hay or pasture. A few areas are used for cultivated crops. Original vegetation was mixed grasses and hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Ozarks area (MLRAs 116A and 116B) of southern Missouri and possibly Northern Arkansas. Extent is moderate.
