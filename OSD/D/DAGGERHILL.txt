DAGGERHILL SERIES

The Daggerhill series consists of very deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in deep sandy eolian sediments on barrier islands.  These gently to strongly sloping soils are on undulating to strongly rolling foredunes and stabilized back-island dune fields.    Slope ranges from 2 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in) mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Hyperthermic, uncoated Ustic Quartzipsamments

TYPICAL PEDON:  Daggerhill fine sand--on a south facing, convex, 8 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 6 meters (20 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A2--20 to 46 cm (8 to 18 in); pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sand, brown (10YR 5/3), moist; single grain; loose; 3 percent very fine and fine roots; 1 percent sand-sized seashell fragments; nonsaline; Sodium Adsorption Ratio is about 1; noneffervescent; strongly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizons is 23 to 71 cm [9 to 28 in])

(Combined thickness of the C horizons is 132 to 180 cm [52 to 71 in])

    C2--119 to 203 cm (47 to 80 in); very pale brown (10YR 7/3) fine sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3), moist; single grain; loose; 1 percent very fine and fine roots; 7 percent sand-sized seashell fragments; nonsaline; Sodium Adsorption Ratio is about 2; noneffervescent; strongly alkaline.

Ecological sites assigned to phases and components of this series are listed below. Current ecological site assignments are in Web Soil Survey. Components of this series include the following ecological sites:  Coastal Dunes

General location: lower Gulf Coast of Texas
Land Resource Region: T (Atlantic and Gulf Coast Lowland Forest and Crop Region)
Major Land Resource Area:  150B (Gulf Coast Saline Prairies)
Extent:  moderate

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas. 

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Kenedy County, Texas; 2007.  The name is from a USGS benchmark on Padre Island National Seashore.

REMARKS:  This soil was formerly included in the Galveston series or mapped as the miscellaneous area - Coastal Dunes.  The series is separated based primarily on the difference in soil moisture regime and sand mineralogy.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 46 cm (0 to 18 in) (A1 and A2 horizons)
Particle-size control section: 25 to 102 cm (10 to 40 in) (A2 and C1 horizons) 

ADDITIONAL DATA:  TAMU reference sample data for pH, salinity, sodicity and mineralogy from S01TX-273-008.  Particle-size analysis, and salinity and sodicity tests performed on 6 pedons at the soil survey project office.
