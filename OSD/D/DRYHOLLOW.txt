DRYHOLLOW SERIES

The Dryhollow series consists of very deep, well drained soils on canyons.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from volcanic ash and pumice.  Slopes are 0 to 55 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy, glassy, mesic Vitritorrandic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Dryhollow loam - on a 20 percent slope at an elevation of 2200 feet, rangeland. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 5 percent pumice gravel and 10 percent 0.5mm to 2.0mm pumice; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 10 inches thick)

    BA--3 to 11 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine and few medium roots; many very fine, fine and few medium tubular pores; 10 percent pumice gravel and 10 percent 0.5mm to 2.0mm pumice; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 11 inches thick)

    Bw1--11 to 20 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine and few medium roots; common very fine, fine and few medium tubular pores; 10 percent pumice gravel and 10 percent 0.5mm to 2.0mm pumice; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.

   Bw2--20 to 35 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) cobbly sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine and few medium roots; common very fine, fine and few medium tubular pores; 10 percent cobbles, 10 percent pumice gravel and 10 percent 0.5mm to 2.0mm pumice; mildly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth  boundary.  (combined thickness of the Bw horizon is 14 to 28 inches)

    C1--35 to 47 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) dry; massive; hard, firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 25 percent pumice gravel and 15 percent 0.5mm to 2.0mm pumice; mildly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual smooth boundary.

    C2--47 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) dry; massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; 40 percent pumice gravel and 15 percent 0.5mm to 2.0mm pumice; mildly alkaline (pH 7.6). (combined thickness of the C horizon is 20 to more than 30 inches)

TYPE LOCATION:  Jefferson County, Oregon, about 1800 feet west and 400 feet north of the SE corner of section 16, T.11 S., R.12 E. (Latitude 44 degrees, 36 minutes, 43 seconds N, Longitude 121 degrees, 17 minutes, 43 seconds W) Warm Springs Indian Reservation.

RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually dry and are dry in all parts of the moisture control section more than half the time (cumulative) that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F.  The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 54 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The particle-size control section averages 10 to 18 percent clay, 30 to 50 percent volcanic glass and glass coated aggregate, less than 0.4 percent acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half iron, 15 to 25 percent phosphate retention, and 8 to 10 percent 15-bar water (dried).

The A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It contains 5 to 15 percent pumice gravel and 5 to 15 percent 0.5mm to 2.0mm pumice.

The Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is loam or sandy loam and contains 5 to 15 percent pumice gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 5 to 15 percent 0.5mm to 2.0mm pumice.  Soil reaction is neutral to mildly alkaline.

The C horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is loam or sandy loam and contains 20 to 40 percent pumice gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 10 to 20 percent 0.5mm to 2.0mm pumice.  Soil reaction is neutral to mildly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Delrio (T) and Deskamp series.  Delrio soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 50 to 52 degrees F.  Deskamp soils are 20 to 40 inches deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dryhollow soils are on nearly level to steep north-facing side slopes of canyons.  The soil formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from volcanic ash and pumice.  Slopes are 0 to 55 percent.  Elevations are 1600 to 2600 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool and moist winters and hot and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free period is 110 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bakeoven, Maupin, Ruckles, Ruclick, and Suppah soils.  Bakeoven soils are on mesas, loamy-skeletal and shallow to basalt.  Maupin soils are on mesas, fine-loamy and moderately deep to basalt.  Ruckles soils are on south-facing side slopes, clayey-skeletal and shallow to basalt. Ruclick soils are on south-facing side slopes, clayey-skeletal and moderately deep to basalt.  Suppah soils are on south-facing side slopes, ashy-pumiceous and moderately deep to fragmental pumice.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is antelope bitterbrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, mountain big sagebrush, Sandberg bluegrass, and western juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Oregon; MLRA 10.  The soils of this series are not extensive.
