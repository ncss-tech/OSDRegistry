DARSIL SERIES

The Darsil series consist of shallow, excessively drained, soils that formed in material weathered from weakly cemented sandstone of Permian age. These soils occur on convex ridge crests of low hills in the North Cross Timbers (MLRA84A). Slopes range from 1 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 864 mm (34 in). Mean air annual temperature is 15.5 degrees C (60 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Thermic, shallow, coated Ustic Quartzipsamments

TYPICAL PEDON: Darsil loamy fine sand, on 4 percent convex west facing slope, in a post oak-blackjack forest with an understory of native grasses. When described, the soil was moist throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

   A--0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 in); brown (7.5YR 5/2) loamy fine sand, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. (13 to 23 cm [3 to 9 in] thick)

   EC--13 to 43 cm (5 to 17 in); pink (7.5YR 7/4) fine sand, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; 2 percent by volume of coarse fragments from 2 mm to 76 mm in diameter; neutral; clear wavy boundary. (15 to 38 cm [6 to 15 in] thick)

   Cr--43 to 58 cm (17 to 23 in); red (2.5YR 5/8) weakly cemented fine grained sandstone, red (2.5YR 4/8) moist; moderately acid.

TYPE LOCATION: Cleveland County, Oklahoma, about 6 miles east of U.S. Highway 77 and Alemeda Street intersection in Norman; 700 feet east and 50 feet south of the northwest corner sec. 32, T. 9 N., R. 1 W. 
USGS Topographic Quadrangle: Denver,OK

A horizon: 
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist 
Chroma: 2 to 6 dry or moist
Texture: loamy fine sand or fine sand
Reaction: strongly acid to slightly alkaline


EC horizon:

Paralithic contact: weakly cemented fine grained sandstone. Root restrictive. High or very high excavation difficulty. Fractures greater than 10 cm apart.  Slakes in water within 15 hours.

COMPETING SERIES: These are no other series in this family. Similar series in MLRA 84 are the Darnell (OK) series that have a cambic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: material weathered from sandstone of Permian age
Landscape: low hills
Landform: convex ridge crests and side slopes of hills
Slopes: 1 to 45 percent
Mean Annual Precipitation: 762 to 1015 mm (30 to 40 in) 
Mean Annual Temperature: 14 to 17 degrees C (58 to 62 degrees F 
Elevation: 229 to 396 m (750 to 1300 ft)
Frost-free period: 200 to 230 days 
Thornthwaite Annual P-E indices: 48 to 64 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Darnell (OK), Harrah (OK), Littleaxe (OK), Newalla (OK), and Stephenville (OK) series. 
Darnell soils: occur on similar landform positions.
Harrah, Littleaxe, and Stephenville soils: more than 50 cm (20 in) to bedrock and are on lower landform positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage: excessively drained
Hydraulic conductivity: rapid
Runoff: medium on 1 to 5 percent slopes, high on 5 to 20 percent slopes, and very high on >20 percent slopes  

USE AND VEGETATION: Rangeland. The native vegetation is post oak and blackjack oak with an understory of mid and tall grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Oklahoma; LRR J; North Cross Timbers (MLRA 84A). The series is of moderate extent.
