DENHAM SERIES

The Denham series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in sandy eolian deposits on outwash plains, glacial lake plains, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, mesic Oxyaquic Udipsamments

TYPICAL PEDON: Denham fine sand, on a 4 percent slope in a cultivated field at an elevation of about 208 meters (683 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

 Ap--0 to 23 cm (9 inches); dark brown (10YR 3/3) fine sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak medium granular structure; very friable; common fine roots; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. [15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 inches) thick]

 Bw1--23 to 43 cm (9 to 17 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) fine sand; weak medium subangular structure; very friable; common fine roots; neutral; clear wavy boundary.

 Bw2--43 to 96 cm (17 to 38 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) fine sand; weak medium subangular structure; very friable; common fine roots in the upper half and few fine roots in the lower half; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.

 Bw3--96 to 124 cm (38 to 49 inches); brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) fine sand; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; very friable; few fine roots; many medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) and common fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; neutral; clear wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bw horizon is 15 to 127 cm (6 to 50 inches).]

 BC1--124 to 158 cm (49 to 62 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) fine sand; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; very friable; few medium faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) and few medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; neutral; clear wavy boundary.

 BC2--158 to 203 cm (62 to 80 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) loamy fine sand; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; very friable; many coarse prominent strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; common fine faint light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) iron depletions in the matrix; neutral.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Abscota, Factoryville, Platteriver, and Solo series. Abscota soils have an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth. Factoryville soils have a solum less than 102 cm (40 inches) in thickness. Platteriver soils average less than 50 percent fine sand in the particle-size control section. Solo soils are in areas that receive more than 1067 mm (42 inches) of mean annual precipitation.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Denham soils are on outwash plains, glacial lake plains, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Denham soils formed in sandy eolian deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1067 mm (30 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 11.7 degrees C (48 to 53 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 180 days. Elevation is 177 to 466 meters (580 to 1,530 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are principally the Brems, Granby, Maumee, Morocco, Newton, and Oakville soils. The moderately well drained Brems and somewhat poorly drained Morocco soils are on slightly lower positions on the landform. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Granby and Maumee soils and the very poorly drained Newton soils are in depressions. Oakville soils are excessively drained and are on higher positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. Depth to the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from 91 to 183 cm (3 to 6 feet) between December and April in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high. Permeability is rapid or very rapid. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Denham soils are used for raising corn, soybeans, and wheat. Some small areas are in hay, pasture, or woodland. Native vegetation is deciduous forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 98 and 111C in northern Indiana and southwestern Michigan. The series is of moderate extent.
