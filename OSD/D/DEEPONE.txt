DEEPONE SERIES

The Deepone series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils occur on fan remnants, stream terraces and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Aridic Paleustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Deepone loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

   E--0 to 10 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium and fine platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots throughout; many very fine and fine vesicular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 15 cm thick)

   Bt--10 to 28 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; strong medium and coarse prismatic structure; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine roots throughout; common very fine and fine dendritic tubular pores; 60 percent prominent clay films on faces of peds; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (15 to 40 cm thick)

   Btk--28 to 41 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine roots throughout; common very fine and fine dendritic tubular pores; 30 percent distinct clay films on faces of peds; finely disseminated calcium carbonate and 5 percent fine and medium irregular soft masses of calcium carbonate throughout; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 25 cm thick)

   Bk--41 to 71 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots throughout; common very fine and fine dendritic tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; finely disseminated calcium carbonate and 30 percent fine and medium soft masses and threads of calcium carbonate throughout; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary. (25 to 51 cm thick)

   C--71 to 152 cm; light very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots in the upper part; common very fine and fine dendritic tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; finely disseminated calcium carbonate throughout; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).
