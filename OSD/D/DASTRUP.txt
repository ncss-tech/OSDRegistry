DASTRUP SERIES

The Dastrup series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone, silt stone and conglomerate.  Dastrup soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Calcixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Dastrup loam, on an east facing convex, 18 percent slope in an alfalfa field at an elevation of 6000 feet.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on September 25, 1975, the soil was dry throughout.

    A--0 to 12 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine vesicular pores; slightly effervescent; carbonates are disseminated; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick)

    Bw--12 to 16 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; strong fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; common fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; carbonates are disseminated; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick)

    Bk1--16 to 36 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/4) dry; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; few very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; carbonates are disseminated and veined; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick)

    Bk2--36 to 48 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/4) dry; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; carbonates are disseminated and veined; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick)

    Bk3--48 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) loam, very pale brown (10YR 8/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; carbonates are disseminated and veined; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Watkins Ridge series.
Watkins Ridge (UT): is dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  Alluvium derived from sandstone, siltstone and conglomerate.
Landform:  Fan remnants.
Slopes:  2 to 30 percent
Elevation: 5,400 to 6,600 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  40 to 45 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  14 to 16 inches.
  Wettest months:  March through May
  Driest months:  July through September.
Frost-free period:  70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the 
Echocreek, Jana, Richsum and Wanship series.  
  Echocreek:  Well drained soil on stream terraces
  Jana:  Shallow soil on mountain slopes
  Richsum:  Deep soil on mountain slopes
  Wanship:  Somewhat poorly drained soil on stream terraces  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, medium to high runoff, moderate to moderately slow permeability.  

USE AND VEGETATION:  Alfalfa-grass hay and cattle grazing.  Native vegetation includes wheatgrasses, bluegrasses and mountain big sagebrush.  This is an upland loam (mountain big sagebrush) ecological site in Utah.
