DUZEL SERIES

The Duzel series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from metamorphic rocks. Duzel soils are on hills and mountainous uplands and have slopes of 5 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TYPE LOCATION: Siskiyou County. California; about 5 miles northeast of Yreka and west of Interstate 5; approximately 2,050 feet south and 900 feet east of the northwest corner sec. 31, T. 46 N., R. 6 W.

RANGES IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to a paralithic contact of weathered bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 46 to 59 degrees F.; mean January soil temperature is 34 to 39 degrees F.; mean July soil temperature is 78 to 83 degrees F. The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. from March 15 to December 1 and exceeds 47 degrees F. from April 15 to November 20. Between the depths of 4 and 12 inches the soil is dry from July 1 until October 15 (90 to 100 days) and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent from the surface through the upper part of the argillic horizon and up to 60 percent in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Most are pebbles less than 3/4 inch diameter, but cobbles and stones are in many pedons. The base saturation ranges from 75 to 95 percent.

The Al horizon is very dark grayish brown, dark grayish brown, grayish brown, dark brown, or brown (10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3; 7.5YR 3/2, 4/2, 5/2). Moist color is black, very dark brown or very dark gray (10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/1, 3/2, 3/3; 7.5YR 3/2). It is sandy loam or loam with 10 to 18 percent clay and is medium acid to neutral.

The B2t horizon is dark grayish brown, grayish brown, brown, dark yellowish brown, yellowish brown, dark reddish gray, reddish gray, or reddish brown (10YR 3/4, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 7.5YR 4/4, 5/2, 5/4; 5YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4). Moist color is very dark grayish brown dark brown, dark grayish brown, dark reddish brown, dark reddish gray or reddish brown (10YR 3/2, 3j3, 4/2, 4/3; 7.5YR 3/2, 4/2; 5YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3). It is loam or clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and at least 3 to 5 percent increase in clay in the Bt horizon over the A horizon. It is medium acid to mildly alkaline.

The B3t horizon has similar color and texture as the B2t horizon. In some pedons, the rock fragments are as much as 80 percent.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Colma, Dragoon, Facey (T), Foehlin (T), Gerig (T), Glenrose, Ladd, Lobitos, Los Gatos, Mehlhorn, Taneum, Tieton and Tweedy series. Colma, Facey, Foehlin and Ladd soils are deeper than 40 inches to a lithic or paralithic contact. Dragoon and Glenrose have a loess mantel or contain a large component of loess and have a large amount of silt and very fine sand. Gerig soils have formed on weathered tuffs at depths of 20 to 40 inches and have a large amount of pyroclastic materials but less than 60 percent. Lobitos, Los Gatos and Mehlhorn soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Also, Lobitos and Los Gatos have less than 20 degrees difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures. Taneum and Tieton soils lack a paralithic contact within a depth of 40 inches. Also, Taneum soils are dry for 60 to 80 consecutive days, have a large amount of loess with 15 to 30 percent sand and 40 to 55 percent silt. Also, Tieton soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments, have a large amount of loess, with 15 to 30 percent sand and 40 to 55 percent silt, and are dry for 80 to 90 days. Tweedy soils are dry for 140 to 150 days and have less than 15 percent rock fragments.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Duzel soils are on mountainous uplands. Slopes are 5 to 75 percent. The soils formed fn colluvium and materials weathered from metamorphosed igneous or sedimentary rocks. Elevations are 2,200 to 5,000 feet. The climate is continental and subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 16 to 24 inches. Seasonal snowfall is 18 to 24 inches. Mean January temperature is 28 to 37 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 64 to 70 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F. Frost-free season is 80 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bonnet, Hilt, Jilson, Kinkel, Marpa, Stoner and the competing Facey soils. Bonnet soils lack an argillic horizon, are more than 60 inches deep and have a loamy-skeletal control section. Jilson soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to hard bedrock. Hilt, Kinkel and Marpa soils have an ochric epipedon.  Also, Kinkle and Marpa soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section. Stoner soils are more than 60 inches deep, and have a coarse-loamy control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to very rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used primarily as rangeland. A few acres that are gently sloping are farmed. Native vegetation consists of bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, Sandberg bluegrass, needlegrass, buckbrush, bitterbrush, manzanita, white oak, scattered ponderosa pine and juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Klamath Mountain area in north-central California. The soil is moderately extensive.

REMARKS: Organic carbon data from similar soils were high enough to qualify for mollic epipedons. B.S. is assumed from similar soils with data.
