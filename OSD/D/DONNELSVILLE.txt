DONNELSVILLE SERIES

The Donnelsville series consists of deep or very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from limestone or dolomite. These soils are on till plains. Slope ranges from 18 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, mesic Inceptic Haprendolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Donnelsville very channery loam, on a 38 percent slope in a pastured woods. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 A--0 to 36 cm (0 to 14 inches); very dark gray (10YR 3/1) very channery loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak fine and very fine granular structure; friable; common medium and fine roots; about 55 percent rock fragments; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. [25 to 38 cm (10 to 15 inches) thick]

 Bw1--36 to 58 cm (14 to 23 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) extremely channery loam; weak fine and very fine granular structure; friable; common medium and fine roots; common distinct very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) organic coatings on faces of peds; about 60 percent rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; broken irregular boundary.

 Bw2--58 to 76 cm (23 to 30 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely channery loam; weak fine and very fine granular structure; friable; common medium and fine roots; common distinct very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) organic coatings in root channels; about 80 percent rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; broken irregular boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bw horizon is 36 to 89 cm (14 to 35 inches).]

 C--76 to 140 cm (30 to 55 inches); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely channery loam; massive; friable; few fine roots; about 85 percent rock fragments; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. [0 to 91 cm (36 inches) thick]

 R--140 to 147 cm (55 to 58 inches); dolomite.

TYPE LOCATION: Clark County, Ohio; about 1.9 miles southwest of Enon, in Mad River Township; about 130 feet east and 845 feet south of the northwest corner of sec. 5, T. 3, R. 8.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Thickness of the solum: 61 to 122 cm (24 to 48 inches)
Thickness of the mollic epipedon: 25 to 48 cm (10 to 19 inches)
Depth to a lithic contact: 102 to 203 cm (40 to 80 inches)

A horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 2 or 3
Chroma: 1 to 3
Texture: channery or very channery analogs of loam or silt loam
Rock fragment content: 15 to 60 percent
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline

Bw horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 3 to 5
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: very channery, extremely channery, or extremely flaggy analogs of loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam
Rock fragment content: 35 to 85 percent
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline

C horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: extremely channery, extremely flaggy, or extremely stony analogs of loam or silt loam
Rock fragment content: 60 to 90 percent
Reaction: moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Castalia series. Castalia soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Donnelsville soils are on back slopes and foot slopes on till plains. Slope ranges from 18 to 70 percent. The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from limestone and dolomite. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1143 mm (35 to 45 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 12 degrees C (50 to 54 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Eldean, Miamian, and Milton soils. Eldean soils formed in outwash materials on outwash terrace, kames, and moraines. Miamian soils formed in high-lime loamy till. Milton soils are moderately deep and formed mainly in loamy till. Miamian and Milton soils are on glaciated uplands generally higher on the landscape.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The potential for surface runoff is medium to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are wooded. Some areas are used for pasture. Native vegetation is forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Ohio; MLRA 111A. The series is of small extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Clark County, Ohio, 1997.

REMARKS: These soils were formerly mapped as "steep land" and as a variant of the Milton series.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 36 cm (A horizon).
Cambic horizon: from a depth of 36 to 76 cm (Bw horizon).
Lithic contact: at 140 cm (top of the R layer).

ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available from The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory for CK-12, the typical pedon.
