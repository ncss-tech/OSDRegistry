DARKBULL SERIES

The Darkbull series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the profile and very rapid in the lower part.  They are on terraces and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  The average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 10 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Sodic Xeric Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Darkbull loam--rangeland.  On a 1 percent smooth slope, N.W.  aspect, 4,700 feet elevation.  (Profile was dry above 22 inches and moist below.  Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.  This profile was described October 23, 1978.)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Darkbull soils are on terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in mixed alluvium at elevations of 4,400 to 6,000 feet.  The climate is cold and moist in the winter and hot and dry in the summer.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 12 inches.  The average summer temperature is 60 to 72 degrees F., and the average annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 95 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Declo, Escalante, Mellor, and Strevell soils.  Declo, Escalante, and Strevell soils have a coarse-loamy control section.  Mellor soils have a natric horizon.  They are all on fan terraces.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to rapid runoff; moderate permeability in the upper part of the profile and very rapid below.

USE AND VEGETATION: Darkbull soils are used for rangeland and irrigated cropland.  Natural vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, and bluebunch wheatgrass.  Irrigated crops are alfalfa, wheat, barley, and sugar beets.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Darkbull soils are of large extent in southern Idaho and northern Utah.
