DOUGHBOY SERIES 

The Doughboy series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils that mostly formed in calcareous, loamy eolian deposits on swales on interdunes on sandhills. Some formed in calcareous loamy alluvium on stream terraces on valleys. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. (48 degrees F.) and mean annual precipitation is about 48 centimeters (19 inches) at the type location.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cullison, Libory, Nenzel, Ord, and Valentine soils.
Cullison soils are on lower swales on interdunes and are poorly and very poorly drained having a seasonal zone of saturation or aquic conditions beginning at the surface. 
Libory soils are on similar swales on interdunes and are sandy over loamy in the control section.
Nenzel soils are on similar swales on interdunes and are sandy in the control section.
Ord soils are slightly lower on swales on interdunes, are coarse loamy over sandy or sandy skeletal in the control section, and are somewhat poorly drained having a seasonal zone of saturation or aquic conditions beginning at 46 centimeters (18 inches). 
Valentine soils are on higher hummocks and dunes, are sandy in the control section, and are excessively drained having no seasonal zone of saturation or aquic conditions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage: Moderately well drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: high
Runoff: negligible 

USE AND VEGETATION: The major use is livestock grazing. A few areas are cultivated or hayed. Irrigated alfalfa is the major crop. The rangeland native plant community for the sandy lowland ecological site (R065XY029NE) is principally sand bluestem, little bluestem, prairie sandreed, needle and thread, and blue grama.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: In the western sandhills of Nebraska and sandhills of southwestern South Dakota (MLRA 65, LRR G). The series is of small extent.

RICs: revised, Bk and Cg horizons: Textures: added clay loam and sandy clay loam. Geographic Setting through Distribution and Extent: revised. Geographically Associated Soils: Deleted Dunday and Ipage, added Cullison, Nenzel, and Ord. Additional Data: revised.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Data is available from the National Soil Survey Center, Soil Survey Laboratory for Pedon ID 86NE031096. Pedon ID 86NE031096 represents the Typical Pedon and it also has data from the Nebraska Department of Roads.
