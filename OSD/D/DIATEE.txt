DIATEE SERIES

The Diatee series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in gravelly alluvium from mixed volcanic sediments.  Diatee soils are on ridge tops and alluvial terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches, the average annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Diatee gravelly sandy loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 2 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots; 15 percent pebbles and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick)

    Bt1--2 to 8 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) gravelly sandy clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common medium fine, very fine and few coarse roots; few thin clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 15 percent pebbles and 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 15 inches thick)

    Bt2--8 to 14 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; common medium and very fine, few coarse and fine roots; few thin clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 20 percent pebbles and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt3--14 to 18 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and plastic; common very fine, few fine and medium roots; very few thin clay films bridging sand grains; 35 percent pebbles and 5 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 11 inches thick)

    2C1--18 to 38 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very gravelly coarse sand, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common medium, fine and very fine roots; 45 percent pebbles and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 20 inches thick)

    2C2--38 to 60 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/4) very gravelly coarse sand, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine, few medium and very fine roots; 45 percent pebbles and 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4).

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Wanetta (MT) series. Wanetta soils receive seventy-five percent of the mean annual precipitation in the six-month period of April through September.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Diatee soils are on ridges, alluvial terraces, and rolling hills.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Elevation ranges from 7,500 to 8,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 to 15 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  The average frost-free season is about 115 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Flugle, Jacques, and Loarc soils.  Flugle soils have no contrasting layer.  Jacques soils have a mollic epipedon and are fine-textured.  Loarc soils have a mollic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Principle use is for rangeland.  Native vegetation is mainly pinyon, juniper, and blue grama.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  This series is of moderate extent in westcentral New Mexico. MLRA 38.
