DAWHOO SERIES

The Dawhoo series consists of deep, very poorly drained, rapidly permeable, sandy soils that formed in marine sediments.  Slopes
range from 0 to 2 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, thermic Typic Humaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Dawhoo loamy fine sand--cultivated. (Colors are for moist soil.)

     Ap--0 to 11 inches; black (10YR 2/1) loamy fine sand; weak
fine granular structure; very friable; many fine roots; high in organic matter; many clean quartz grains; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to 12 inches thick)

     A--11 to 18 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2)
loamy fine sand; weak fine granular structure; very friable; few
fine roots; high in organic matter; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (5 to 12 inches thick)

     Cg1--18 to 30 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loamy
fine sand; few fine faint light gray (10YR 6/1) mottles; single grained; loose; few fine roots and pores; few reddish brown concretions; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (10 to 30 inches thick)

     Cg2--30 to 52 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sand;
few fine faint pale brown (10YR 6/3) mottles; single grained;
loose; few fine pores; common dark brown and black concretions;
many clean sand grains; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.
(12 to 30 inches thick)

     Cg3--52 to 60 inches; greenish gray (5GY 6/1) and gray (10YR 5/1) sand; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) mottles; single grained; few clean sand grains; many dark colored minerals; slightly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Charleston County, South Carolina; on Johns
Island, 3/4 mile south of County Road 20 and Andell's Creek
Bridge intersection and 1 mile west of Kiawah River.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is slightly acid or neutral throughout the profile.  There are few to common dark colored concretions in most pedons.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or neutral, value of 2 or 3,
and chroma of 0 to 2.  Total thickness of the A horizon is less
than 24 inches.  The A horizon is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or fine sand.

The upper part of the C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, or it is neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2, commonly with
mottles in shades of yellow or brown.  The upper part of the C horizon is loamy fine sand, fine sand, or sand.  The lower part
of the C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, 5GY, 5G, or neutral,
value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 0 to 1, commonly with mottles in shades of yellow or brown.  The lower part of the C horizon is
fine sand or sand.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other known series in this
family.  Similar soils in other families are the Johnston,
Murville, Osier, Pickney, Plummer, Pocomoke, Polawana, Rutlege,
and Scranton series.  Johnston, Pickney, and Polawana soils have
an umbric epipedon that is more than 24 inches thick.  Murville
soils have a spodic horizon beneath the A horizon and have
siliceous mineralogy.  Osier, Plummer, and Scranton soils do not
have an umbric epipedon.  Pocomoke soils have a Bt horizon within
20 inches of the surface.  Rutlege soils have siliceous
mineralogy.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dawhoo soils are on low level areas, 5 to 20 feet above sea level, bordering the Atlantic coast.  The soil
formed in sandy marine sediments.  Climate is warm-temperature
and humid with mean annual temperature of about 66 degrees F.,
and mean annual precipitation of about 49 inches.  The frost-free growing season is 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the similar Polawana series plus the Edisto, Kiawah, Seabrook, and Wando series.
Edisto, Kiawah, Seabrook, and Wando soils do not have an umbric epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained; very slow
surface runoff; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of these soils are in woodland
consisting of sweet gum, water oak, black gum, red maple, and occasionally loblolly pine and cypress.  Cleared and drained
areas are used for Irish potatoes, cabbage, corn, cucumbers, tomatoes, snapbeans, soybeans, and pasture grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South Carolina and possibly Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and other Atlantic and Gulf Coast
states.  The series is of moderate extent with more than 10,000
acres in Charleston County, South Carolina.

REMARKS:  These soils were formerly mapped with the Rutlege
series.
