DURREO SERIES

The Durreo series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from basalt, andesite, and rhyolite. Durreo soils are on volcanic hills.  Slopes range from 1 to 9 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 6 to 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplocalcids

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Costilla County, Costilla County soil survey area, Colorado, 2009.  The name is coined.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 25 to 102 centimeters.  (Bk horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 15 centimeters.  (A horizons)
Calcic horizon:  The zone from 15 to 203 centimeters.  (Bk horizons)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
