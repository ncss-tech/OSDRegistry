DARDRY SERIES

The Dardry series consists of very deep, well drained soils on high terraces of mountain valley floors and mountain toeslopes.  Dardry soils formed in stream alluvium from mixed rocks. Slopes are 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches and mean annual temperature about 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Cumulic Ultic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Dardry loam - woodland, on a 0 percent slope at an elevation of 3,760 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted. Soil textures are apparent field textures.)

  Oi--0 to 1 inches; slightly decomposed plant material consisting of needles and twigs

  A1--1 to 7 inches; black (7.5YR 2.5/1) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) dry; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure, parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel, and 5 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.5); gradual smooth boundary.  (5 to 11 inches thick)

  A2--7 to 12 inches; very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) very cobbly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) dry; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine, few medium and coarse roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel, 10 cobbles, and 5 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.3); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 17 inches thick)

  AC--12 to 36 inches; very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/3) extremely cobbly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine, medium and coarse roots; common very fine irregular pores; 30 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones, and 1 percent boulders; slightly acid (pH 6.5); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 25 inches thick)

  C--36 to 61 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) extremely cobbly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) dry; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots throughout; few very fine irregular pores; 35 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones, and 2 percent boulders; slightly acid (pH 6.5).
