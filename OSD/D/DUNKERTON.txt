DUNKERTON SERIES

The Dunkerton series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in 50 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) of sandy eolian sediments and underlying glacial till. Dunkerton soils are on long convex side slopes and summits on dissected till plains. Slopes range from 2 to 9 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (49 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 84 centimeters (33 inches).

Saturated hydraulic conductivity--high in the eolian sediments and low or moderately low in the glacial till
Surface runoff potential--very low or low

Most areas are cultivated. The principal crops are corn and soybeans. The native vegetation is big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, other grasses of the tall grass prairie and mixed deciduous trees.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 38 to 88 centimeters (15 to 35 inches) (Bt1 and 2Bt2 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (0 to 59 inches) (Ap, BE, Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3, 2BC horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 38 centimeters (0 to 15 inches) (Ap and BE horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 38 to 124 centimeters (15 to 49 inches) (Bt1, 2Bt2 and 2Bt3 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Aquollic subgroup based on low value of zone from the surface to a depth of 38 centimeters (0 to 15 inches) (Ap and BE horizons) and redoximorphic depletions in the zone from a depth of 38 to 64 centimeters (15 to 25 inches) (Bt1 horizon).

Some pedons have vertical seams or wedges of sand or loamy sand about 5 to 15 centimeters (2 to 6 inches) wide and about 0.9 to 1.2 meters (3 to 4 feet) deep extending downward from the stone line into the glacial till.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
