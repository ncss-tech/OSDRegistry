DAST SERIES 

The Dast series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, and residuum from semiconsolidated sandy sedimentary beds.  These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills. Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Calciustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Dast fine sandy loam in grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 3 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots and few medium roots; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick) 

    Bw1--3 to 9 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; weak coarse and very coarse prismatic structure parting to weak fine subangular blocky; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots and common very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual smooth boundary. 

    Bw2--9 to 21 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) fine sandy loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots; many and common fine and very fine pores; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary. (The combined thickness of the Bw horizons is 10 to 24 inches.) 

    Bk--21 to 35 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) fine sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; few fine and very fine pores; many fine and medium masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 15 inches thick) 

    Cr--35 to 60 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) weakly consolidated sedimentary beds that crush to loamy fine sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0).

COMPETING SERIES: 

Ambrant (MT) - is very deep; has horizon which contains lamellae; has 2C horizon at 28 to 46 inches. 

Kellygulch (MT) - has lithic contact at 23 to 40 inches; does not have horizon of secondary carbonate accumulation; formed in colluvium and residuum from granite. 

Lisk (MT) - is very deep. 

Ramps (UT) - have a lithic contact at a moderate depth; have 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments throughout the profile. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 

Landform - sedimentary plains and hills. 

Elevation - 2,900 to 5,000 feet. 

Slopes - 0 to 70 percent. 

Parent material - alluvium, colluvium, and residuum derived from semiconsolidated sandstone. 

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers. 

Mean annual precipitation - 12 to 19 inches, of which more than half falls in spring and early summer. 

Mean annual air temperature - 40 to 45 degrees F. 

Frost-free period - 90 to 135 days.  In Wyoming the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well-drained; moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for nonirrigated crops and rangeland.  The potential native vegetation is mainly prairie sandreed, little bluestem, needleandthread, and thickspike wheatgrass, forbs, and shrubs.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation records:  MT0006.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - from the soil surface to 7 inches (A, Bw1 horizons); cambic horizon - from 3 to 21 inches (Bw1, Bw2 horizons); accumulation of lime - from 21 to 35 inches (Bk horizon); particle-size control section - from 10 inches to the paralithic contact (Bw2, Bk horizons).  Dast soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
