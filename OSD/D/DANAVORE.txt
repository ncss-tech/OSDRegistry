DANAVORE SERIES

The Danavore series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived from interbedded sandstone and shale. Danavore soils are on mountainsides and crests. Slopes range from 5 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Calcic Haplocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Danavore very stony sandy loam, rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    A--0 to 4 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very stony sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and medium roots; 20 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick) 

    Bw1--4 to 8 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely stony sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common medium and coarse roots; 15 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, 40 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick) 

    2Bw2--8 to 17 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely channery loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive, soft, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common medium and coarse roots; 70 percent channers; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual smooth boundary. (5 to 15 inches thick) 

    2Bk--17 to 22 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) extremely channery clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; soft, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few medium and coarse roots; 70 percent channers; calcium carbonate pendants on rock fragments, slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick) 

    2Cr--22 inches; soft sandstone. 

TYPE LOCATION: Moffat County, Colorado; approximately 20 miles southwest of Hamilton, about 1,400 feet west and 1,200 feet south of the northeast corner of Sec. 17, T. 4 N., R. 94 W. Latitude: 40 degrees, 19 minutes, 14 seconds north; longitude: 107 degrees, 57 minutes, 26 seconds west. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 39 to 42 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 49 to 54 degrees F. 
Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches. 
Depth to effervescent horizons is 0 to 20 inches. 

The particle-size control section has 35 to 75 percent rock fragments.

2Bk horizon:
Hue:  5Y through 7.5YR
Value:  5 through 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist
Chroma:  2 through 6
Texture:  Loam or clay loam with very channery or extremely channery modifiers

COMPETING SERIES: These are the  Ellena, Elve, Hiore, Millswitch, Pergrin, Rubick, Scout, Shadow, Taglake, and Vandamore (CO) series. 

Ellena, Vandamore - have lithic contacts above 40 inches

Elve, Hiore, Millswitch, Rubick, Scout, Shadow, Taglake - do not have paralithic or lithic contacts above 40 inches

Pergrin - has granite rock fragments

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Danavore soils are on mountainsides and hillcrests. Slopes range from 5 to 30 percent. The soil formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived from interbedded sandstone and shale. Elevation ranges from 7,200 to 8,600 feet. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 20 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 37 to 40 degrees F. The frost-free period is about 45 to 75 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cochetopa, Jerry, Rhone, and Waybe soils. The Cochetopa, Jerry, and Rhone soils are deep and have mollic epipedons. The Waybe soil is shallow to bedrock. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderate to moderately slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation consists of bluebunch wheatgrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, Sandberg bluegrass, prairie junegrass, and black sagebrush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Danavore soils occur in northwestern Colorado. The series is of small extent. Total area in Moffat and Rio Blanco counties is about 2,100 acres.
