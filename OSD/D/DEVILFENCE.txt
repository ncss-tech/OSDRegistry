DEVILFENCE SERIES 

The Devilfence series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum derived from hard brown shale or argillite bedrock.  These soils are on escarpments, ridges and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Devilfence very channery loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 3 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very channery loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and many very fine roots; many fine and very fine interstitial pores; 40 percent channers; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 5 inches thick) 

    Bw--3 to 7 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very channery loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate, medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 5 percent flagstones, 40 percent channers; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 5 inches thick) 

    Bk1--7 to 11 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely channery loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common fine and very fine pores; 10 percent flagstones, 55 percent channers; lime coatings on rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. 

    Bk2--11 to 14 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely channery loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots between channers; 15 percent flagstones, 60 percent channers; lime casts on rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of Bk horizons is 7 to 12 inches thick) 

    R--14 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) hard fractured shale. 

TYPE LOCATION:  Jefferson County, Montana; 1,500 feet south and 325 feet west of the NE corner of sec. 34, T. 4 N., R. 2 W.

Sharrott (MT) - does not have a horizon of secondary carbonate accumulation; has less than 15 percent clay in the particle-size control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 

Landform - escarpments, ridges and hills. 

Elevation - 4,400 to 6,500 feet. 

Slope - 2 to 60 percent slopes. 

Parent material - residuum derived from hard brown shale or argillite. 

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers. 

Mean annual precipitation - 15 to 19 inches. 

Mean annual air temperature - 36 to 45 degrees F. 

Frost-free period - 70 to 105 days. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Devilfence soils are primarily used for rangeland. The potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, needleandthread, Sandberg bluegrass, big sagebrush, and juniper.  Some areas have a thin overstory of Douglas-fir and limber pine. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Devilfence soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Jefferson County, Montana, 1998.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1561.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the surface to 7 inches, mixed (A, Bw horizons); a cambic horizon from 3 to 11 inches (Bw, Bk1 horizons); a particle-size control section from the surface to 14 inches (A, Bw, Bk1, Bk2 horizons); a layer of lime accumulation from 7 to 14 inches (Bk1, Bk2 horizons); hard shale bedrock at 14 inches (R horizon).  Devilfence soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
