DIXBORO SERIES

The Dixboro series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in stratified glaciofluvial deposits. These soils are on lake plains, outwash plains, and deltas. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C (49 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Aquollic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Dixboro fine sandy loam, on a southwest-facing, concave, 2 percent slope in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 23 cm (9 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) fine sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; friable; many fine roots; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. [15 to 23 cm (6 to 9 inches) thick]

 E--23 to 28 cm (9 to 11 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam; moderate thin and medium platy structure; very friable; few very fine roots; few very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) worm casts; common medium prominent yellowish red (5YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary. [0 to 20 cm (8 inches) thick]

 Bt1--28 to 46 cm (11 to 18 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few very fine roots; few faint clay films on faces of peds; many medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6 ) and prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/8), and few medium prominent yellowish red (5YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron; common medium faint grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions; neutral; clear wavy boundary.

 Bt2--46 to 58 cm (18 to 23 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few very fine roots; common faint clay films on faces of peds; many medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6 ) and prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/8), and few medium prominent yellowish red (5YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron; common medium faint grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions; neutral; clear wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 18 to 51 cm (7 to 20 inches).]

 BC--58 to 71 cm (23 to 28 inches); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loamy fine sand; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; very friable; few very fine roots; many medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) and prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/8), and few medium prominent yellowish red (5YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron; few medium distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions; slightly effervescent in lower part; slightly alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary. [8 to 30 cm (3 to 12 inches) thick]

 C--71 to 152 cm (28 to 60 inches); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) stratified silt loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, and fine sand; massive; friable and very friable; common gray (10YR 6/1) secondary calcium carbonate segregations in silt loam strata; many coarse distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) and prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron; common coarse distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Washtenaw County, Michigan; about 5 miles northeast of the village of Milan; 660 feet south and 85 feet east of the northwest corner of sec. 14, T. 4 S., R. 7 E.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Brady, Budd, Poseyville, Whiskerville, and Winamac series. Brady and Winamac soils are deeper than 102 cm (40 inches) to carbonates. Budd soils typically have a lithologic discontinuity with till in the lower part of the series control section. Poseyville soils have sola less than 61 cm (24 inches) in thickness. Whiskerville soils do not have stratified textures in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dixboro soils are on lake plains, outwash plains, and deltas. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. These soils formed in stratified glaciofluvial deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 914 mm (28 to 36 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.3 to 10.0 degrees C (47 to 50 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The Dixboro soils are on lake plains with well drained Sisson soils, poorly drained Colwood, Lamson, and Pella soils, and somewhat poorly drained Kibbie, Thetford, and Tedrow soils. Thetford and Tedrow soils have more than sand in the upper subsoil. Kibbie soils are fine-loamy.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Depth to the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from 30 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) between November and April in normal years. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to low.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of the Dixboro soils are cultivated. Corn, soybeans, small grains, and legume-grass hay are the principal crops. In some areas, these soils are used for permanent pasture or forest. Native vegetation is hardwood forest, principally American elm, Northern red oak, hickory, American basswood, and red maple.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 98, 99, and 111B in southern and central Michigan and northwestern Ohio. The series is of moderate extent.
