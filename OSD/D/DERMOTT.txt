DERMOTT SERIES

The Dermott series consists of soils that are very shallow and shallow to a fractured and weathered petrocalcic horizon. They are well drained and moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy residuum derived from the Ogallala Formation. These soils are on gently to steeply sloping hills and ridges. Slope ranges from 3 to 30 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic, shallow Petrocalcic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Dermott gravelly loam on a south facing, convex, 4 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 2573 feet.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Scurry County, Texas; 2004, MLRA 78 soil survey area, Texas, 2004. The name is from a community on the Roscoe Plain.

REMARKS: The Dermott series was formerly included in the Potter series. The series was separated based on the petrocalcic horizon, mineralogy and moisture regime. 

Edited 11/2015 (RFG-ROG): Changed to tabular format. Added metric measurements. Updated competing series, geographic setting, and associated soils sections. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 30 cm (0 to 12 in). (A1 and A2 horizons) 
Petrocalcic horizon: 30 to 104 cm (12 to 41 in). (Bkm and Bkm/Bk horizons) 
Calcic horizon: 104 to 211 cm (41 to 83 in). (Bk horizons) 

Additional Comments: 
The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by National Soil Survey Laboratory data number S03-TX-415-004 from Scurry County, Texas. 

ADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL Data from type location S03-TX-415-004. Particle-size analysis, silicate clay analysis, calcium carbonate equivalent, and pH were performed at the project office on 5 pedons. The array of colors, horizon depths, and percentages of carbonates and fragments from 15 described pedons.
