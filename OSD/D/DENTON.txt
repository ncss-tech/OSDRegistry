DENTON SERIES

The Denton series consist of deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey materials over residuum weathered from limestone bedrock of lower Cretaceous age. These nearly level or gently sloping soils are on backslopes and footslopes of ridges. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 18.9 degrees C (66 degrees F).

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Denton County, Texas; 1918.

REMARKS:  This revision recognizes that the lithic contact is deeper (40 to 60 inches) and that typically a lag line of limestone fragments occur within 20 to 40 inches of the surface. This lag line apparently was considered to be a lithic contact. Minimal change in interpretations will result due to the upper part being clayey.

Classification is changed 11/89 from fine-silty, carbonatic, thermic Typic Calciustolls to fine-silty, carbonatic, thermic Udic Calciustolls.
