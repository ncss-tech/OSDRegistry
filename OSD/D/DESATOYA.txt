DESATOYA SERIES

The Desatoya series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Desatoya soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Clayey over loamy-skeletal, smectitic over mixed, superactive, mesic Durinodic Xeric Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Desatoya very gravelly loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is partially covered with approximately 50 percent gravel.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lander County, Nevada; about 28 miles west of Austin; 2,000 feet east and 1,000 feet south of the northwest corner of section 10, T.18 N., R.39 E. latitude 39 degrees 26 minutes 40 seconds N and longitude 117 degrees 34 minutes 56 seconds W; NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry in early June through October, moist in winter and spring; aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 9 to 11 degrees C.
Depth to secondary carbonates: 25 to 50 cm.
Depth to base of argillic horizon and strongly contrasting horizons with brittle silica cementation: 25 to 50 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 35 to 45 percent in the upper part and 8 to 18 percent in the lower part. 
Rock fragments: 20 to 30 percent in the upper part and 40 to 80 percent in the lower part, fragments are mainly gravel of mixed lithologies.

A horizon
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist.

Calcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 2 percent.
Other features: Some pedons have thin subhorizons of clay loam with 5 to 15 percent gravel.

2Bqk horizons
Texture: Stratified extremely gravelly sandy loam to very gravelly loamy sand and averages very gravelly or extremely gravelly sandy loam.
Consistence: Hard or very hard dry, firm to slightly brittle moist.
Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 2 to 5 percent.
Cementation: Discontinuous, brittle, strongly silica-cemented masses or lenses; with subhorizons below 97 cm that are discontinuously weakly to strongly silica-cemented.

COMPETING SERIES:  At present, there are no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Desatoya soils are on fan remnants. They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,520 to 2,260 meters.  The climate is cool-semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 9 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Jung, McConnel, and Ricert soils. Jung soils are clayey-skeletal and are shallow to hard bedrock on adjacent hills and mountains.  McConnel soils are sandy-skeletal, have cambic horizons, and occur on adjacent fan remnants and beach terraces.  Ricert soils are fine-loamy, have natric horizons, and occur on adjacent fan remnants.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high or very high surface runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity

USE AND VEGETATION:  Desatoya soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is black sagebrush, shadscale, low sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, and pine bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western and northern Nevada. These soils are of small extent. MLRAs 27 and 24.
