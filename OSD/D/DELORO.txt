DELORO SERIES

The Deloro series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium dominantly from shale, schist, phyllite or sandstone.  Deloro soils are on pediments, hills and mountains.  Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic, shallow Ustic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Deloro extremely channery loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 2 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely channery loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many interstitial pores; 65 percent channers; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.3); clear wavy boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick)

    Bt--2 to 11 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) extremely channery clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine granular structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine roots; many interstitial pores; common faint clay films lining pores and coating channers; 75 percent channers; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (9 to 16 inches thick)

    2Crt--11 to 60 inches; highly fractured, weathered phyllite; dark red (10R 3/6) clay coatings and common very fine roots in fractures.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Deloro soils are on pediments, hills and mountains.   Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent.  Deloro soils formed in alluvium from schist, quartzite, shale, phyllite or sandstone.  Elevations range from 2,900 to 5,720 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 67 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 180 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Andrada, Chiricahua, Mabray, Oracle, and Schrap soils.  Andrada soils do not have argillic horizons and have a calcic horizon.  Mabray soils are carbonatic and have a lithic contact.  Schrap soils do not have argillic horizons.  Chiricahua soils are clayey. Oracle soils are loamy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; rapid runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for livestock grazing.  Vegetation is ocotillo, yucca, catclaw, agave, pricklypear, cholla, shrubby buckwheat, slender grama, tobosa, black grama, sideoats grama, hairy grama, wolftail, curlymesquite, false-mesquite, plains lovegrass, and threeawn.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Arizona.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA is 41.
