DALHART SERIES

The Dalhart series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy eolian sediments of Holocene age.  These nearly level to moderately sloping soils occur on sandsheets and interdunes of the Southern High Plains, Northern Part (MLRA 77A).  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 13 degrees C (55 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm (18 in).
