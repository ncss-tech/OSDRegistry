COMPETING SERIES: 
Nagunt soils - occur on wash over fan flats and slope landforms in sandy marine deposits and do not contain glauconite in the fine earth fraction. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Broad Creek soils - occur on Estuarine Tidal Stream Channel landforms; composed of fine fluid estuarine deposits; and has a buried A horizon.
Hillsmere soils - occur on Estuarine Channel and Mainland Cove landforms; composed of fine fluid estuarine deposits.
Longpoint soils - occur on Submerged Tidal Marsh landforms; composed of sandy estuarine deposits and organic soil material overlying a lithologic discontinuity comprised of a relatively intact paleosol.
Overboard soils - occur on Estuarine Tidal Creek Platform landforms; composed of fine fluid estuarine deposits overlying a lithologic discontinuity comprised of Tertiary deposits.
South River soils - occur on Wave-Cut Platform landforms; have a lithologic discontinuity comprised of Tertiary material; has a glauconitic mineralogy and horizons with chroma 3 or more between 15 and 100 cm.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage Class: Subaqueous drainage
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: High to very high
Soil Moisture Regime: Peraquic
Soil is permanently submerged / continuously inundated with brackish water. The presence of hypersulfidic materials within 50 cm of the soil surface puts these soils at risk for potential acid sulfate soil formation if they are dredged and exposed to the air.

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses: Areas of this soil are used for recreational fishing, swimming, and boating. Commercial uses include shell fishing and aquaculture.
Dominant Vegetation: Benthic fauna such as clams, blue crabs, and oysters are associated with this soil. Eelgrass (Zostera marina), sea lettuce (Ulva sp.), and horned pondweed (Zannichellia palustris) may occur on these soils.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Atlantic Coastal Plain estuaries along the Atlantic Seaboard and sub-estuaries of the western portion of the Chesapeake Bay. MLRA 149A. This series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Anne Arundel County, Maryland, 2022.

REMARKS: This subaqueous series is named for Duvall Creek, a feature of the South River sub-estuary of Chesapeake Bay and areas of soil mapping were formerly included with water.

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are (Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2012):
-Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 32 centimeters (Ase and Aseg horizons)
-Peraquic feature - the zone from 0 to 183 centimeters is permanently saturated
-Hyper-sulfidic materials - the zone from 0 to 183 centimeters incubated pH values less than 4.0 after 16 weeks.
-n Value less than 0.7 - the zone from 0 to 183 centimeters.
