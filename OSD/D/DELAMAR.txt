DELAMAR SERIES

The Delamar series consists of moderately deep to an indurated duripan, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium derived from welded tuff with minor influence from limestone.  The Delamar soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 175 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Delamar soils are on summits and shoulders of fan remnants.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium derived from welded tuff and rhyolite with minor amounts of limestone. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 1,400 to 1,980 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool moist winters and intermittently moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 125 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 130 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Koyen, Penoyer and Tybo soils.  Koyen soils lack an argillic horizons and a duripan, and have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections. Penoyer soils lack an argillic horizon and a duripan, and have coarse-silty particle-size control sections. Tybo soils have duripans within 50 cm of the soil surface and have loamy particle-size control sections.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; low to medium runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Delamar soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly spiny hopsage, horsebrush, low rabbitbrush, galleta and cacti.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Nevada. MLRA 29. These soils are moderately extensive.
