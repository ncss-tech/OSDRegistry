DUFFER SERIES

The Duffer series consists of very deep, poorly drained or somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium, loess, and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks. Duffer soils are on flood plains, stream terraces, lake plains, basin floors, and alluvial flats. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Duffer soils are on flood plains, stream terraces, lake plains, flood plain, basin floors, and alluvial flats. These soils formed in alluvium, loess, and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations range from 1,220 to 2,110 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Needle Peak, Ocala, Pocker, Preble, and Prida soils. None of these soils have calcic horizons. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained or somewhat poorly drained; low through high surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. A seasonal high water table is present between 46 and 100 cm (Shallow to Deep free water occurrence classes). Cumulative annual duration classes are Common or Persistent (January through June). Drained phases have water tables between 90 and 150 cm. These soils are susceptible to flooding and have rare, very brief periods, year-long or occasional, very brief periods from January through June. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Duffer soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly rabbitbrush, black greasewood, basin wildrye, inland saltgrass, and alkali sacaton. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern and central Nevada. These soils are moderately extensive. MLRAs 24 and 28B.
