DURANGO SERIES

The Durango series consists of very deep, well drained soil formed in fine textured slope alluvium or colluvium derived from shale.  Durango soils are on hillslopes, paleoterraces, and ridges.  Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 381 mm and mean annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Durango cobbly loam, on a northeast facing, simple, 10 percent slope in chained pinyon-juniper woodland at an elevation of 2,256 meters.   (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) When described on 6/12/79 the soil was moist from 0 to 107 cm.

     A--0 to 8 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/2) cobbly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; 20 percent cobble, 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 20 cm thick)
