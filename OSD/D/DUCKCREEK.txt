DUCKCREEK SERIES

The Duckcreek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils  that formed in interbedded shale and sandstone residuum and clayey sedimentary beds. These soils are on hills, mountains and escarpments. Slopes are 4 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches and mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive Ustic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Duckcreek loam, in rangeland (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 6 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine pores; 5 percent gravel, 5 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 12 inches thick) 

    Bt1--6 to 15 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to strong fine granular; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and few fine and medium roots; common very fine pores; common faint discontinuous clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. 

    Bt2--15 to 29 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular;  hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine interstitial and tubular pores; common faint discontinuous clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt1 and Bt2 horizon 15 to 25 inches)

    Bk--29 to 36 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) sandy clay loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine interstitial and tubular pores; common fine soft masses of lime; 30 percent soft shale fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 17 inches thick)

    Cr--36 to 60 inches; semiconsolidated black shale; strongly effervescent.
