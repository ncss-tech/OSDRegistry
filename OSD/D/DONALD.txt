DONALD SERIES

The Donald series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on fan remnants, alluvial fans, stream terraces, hills and mountain slopes. Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.
