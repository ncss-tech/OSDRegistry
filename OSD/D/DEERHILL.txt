DEERHILL SERIES

The Deerhill series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from metamorphic rock. The Deerhill soils are on mountainflanks and hillsides. Slopes range from 9 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 686 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, isotic, frigid Ultic Palexeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Deerhill gravelly fine sandy loam on a south west facing (230 degree), 37 percent slope at an elevation of 2191 meters. When described on 06/08/2004 the soil was dry throughout. Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Kingsbeach soils. The Kingsbeach soils are devoid of fragments in the lower part and are on alluvial fans.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Deerhill soils are on mountainflanks and hillsides. Slopes range from 9 to 50 percent. These soils formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from metamorphics. Elevation is 1915 to 2285 meters.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is to 580 to 790 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C. The frost free season is 40 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cagwin, and Shakespeare soils. The Cagwin soils are over granodiorite while the Shakespeare soils are at higher elevations and have colder summer temperatures.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, high runoff, moderately slow permeability, no flooding or ponding

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for primarily for woodland and wildlife. Vegetation is conifers mostly Jeffrey pine and white fir with an understory of manzanita and mountain big sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Deerhill is of minor extent in Nevada in MLRA 22A -- Sierra Nevada Mountains
