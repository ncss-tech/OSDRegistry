DEADYON SERIES

The Deadyon series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from granitic rocks.  The Deadyon soils are on fan skirts, inset fans and fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Haplargids

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ratleflat, Saralegui, and Tarloc series.  

Ratleflat soils are moist for 10 to 20 days in the summer, have mean annual soil temperatures of 12 to 15 degrees C and 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the argillic horizon.  Saralegui soils are noncalcareous above 100 cm and lacks a discontinuity above 100 cm.  Tarloc soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 50 to 100 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Deadyon soils are on fan skirts, inset fans and fan piedmonts.  These soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from granitic rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 1,220 to 1,680 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C, and frost-free season is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Biga, Shawave and Slipback soils.  All of these soils have a natric horizon with more than 18 percent clay.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained, slow to medium runoff;  moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, spiny hopsage, Indian ricegrass and pine bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.
