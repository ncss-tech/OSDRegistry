DISALTO SERIES

The Disalto series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountain side slopes and ridges.  They formed in loess over material from quartzite and phyllite of the Wallace Formation of the Belt supergroup that is blanketed by a thick mantle of volcanic ash. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Slope ranges from 5 to 60 percent.  The average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 39 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy over loamy, amorphic over mixed, superactive, frigid Alfic Udivitrands

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Disalto soils are on mountain sides and ridge summits.  Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent.  These soils formed in loess over quartzite or phyllite with a thick mantle of volcanic ash at elevations of 2,740 to 5,050 feet (835 to 1540 meters).   The average annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F, with an average annual precipitation of 31 to 55 inches (787 to 1397 mm).  The frost free season is 85 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Secunda, Flewsie and Bouldercreek soils.  Secunda and Flewsie soils do not have a horizon formed in loess and are on steep mountain sides and narrow ridges.  Bouldercreek soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments below an ash cap and are on steep mountain sides.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, watershed, and recreation.  Potential natural vegetation is western red cedar, grand fir, western hemlock, western larch, western white pine, Douglas-fir, and ponderosa pine, with an understory of wild ginger, queencup beadlily, coolwort foamflower, pioneer violet, princes pine, and fools huckleberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Idaho. The series is not extensive.  MLRA 43A.
