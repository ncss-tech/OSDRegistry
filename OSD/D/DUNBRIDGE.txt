DUNBRIDGE SERIES

The Dunbridge series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in sandy and loamy drift overlying limestone or dolostone bedrock. These soils are on reefs on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Mollic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Dunbridge sandy loam, 1 to 4 percent slopes, at an elevation of 213 meters (700 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap1--0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 inches); dark brown (10YR 3/3) sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak medium and fine granular structure; friable; many roots; 5 percent gravel; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.

 Ap2--13 to 23 cm (5 to 9 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak medium and coarse granular structure; friable; many roots; 5 percent gravel; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. [Combined thickness of the Ap horizon is 18 to 23 cm (7 to 9 inches).]

 Bt1--23 to 33 cm (9 to 13 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) sandy clay loam; weak coarse and medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; few very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) worm casts in the matrix; common distinct brown (10YR 4/3) clay films on faces of peds; 3 percent gravel; neutral; clear wavy boundary.

 Bt2--33 to 51 cm (13 to 20 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay loam; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; common distinct brown (10YR 4/3) clay films on faces of peds and bridging between sand grains; 1 percent gravel; neutral; clear smooth boundary.

 Bt3--51 to 63 cm (20 to 25 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) sandy clay loam; weak coarse and medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few roots; common distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay bridging between sand grains; 4 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.

 Bt4--63 to 76 cm (25 to 30 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay loam; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; few roots; common distinct brown (10YR 4/3) clay films on faces of peds; 2 percent gray (10YR 6/1) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) weathered limestone gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 25 to 84 cm (10 to 33 inches).]

 2R--76 cm (30 inches); fractured limestone.

TYPE LOCATION: Sandusky County, Ohio; about 1.25 miles south of Gibsonburg, in Madison Township; 1240 feet east and 1240 feet south of the northwest corner of sec. 25, T. 5 N., R. 13 E.; USGS Helena, Ohio topographic quadrangle; lat. 41 degrees 21 minutes 58 seconds N. and long. 83 degrees 18 minutes 58 seconds W., NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Thickness of the solum: typically 51 to 76 cm (20 to 30 inches), but ranges from 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches)
Depth to the base of the argillic horizon: typically 51 to 76 cm (20 to 30 inches), but ranges from 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches)

Bt horizon:
Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 3 to 6

2BC or 2C horizon, where present:
Hue: 7.5YR to 5Y
Value: 4 to 7
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: gravelly to extremely gravelly, cobbly to extremely cobbly, or stony to extremely stony analogs of loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam
Rock fragment content: 15 to 90 percent
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline

2Cr horizon, where present: fractured limestone or dolostone with fractures and cracks more than 10 cm (4 inches) apart

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Lauramie, Longlois, Lydick, Mohawk, Oneco, and Razort series. These soils do not have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Dunbridge soils are on reefs on lake plains of late Wisconsin age. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Dunbridge soils formed in sandy and loamy drift overlying limestone or dolostone bedrock. Fractured limestone or dolostone of Silurian age is at a depth of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 914 mm (27 to 36 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 165 days. Elevation is 183 to 244 meters (600 to 800 feet) above mean sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Castalia, Marblehead, Millsdale, and Milton soils. The Castalia soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the subsoil. The somewhat excessively drained Marblehead soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 25 cm (10 inches). The Milton soils and the very poorly drained Millsdale soils are fine-textured.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high. Permeability is moderately rapid. 

USE AND VEGETATION: A large part has been cleared and is cultivated. Corn, soybeans, wheat, and hay are the principal crops. Some areas are in woodland, permanent pasture, or are idle. Native vegetation is deciduous forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Ohio and possibly southeastern Michigan; MLRA 99. The series is of small extent.
