DATEMARK SERIES 

The Datemark series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone. Datemark soils are on mountains. Slopes range from 30 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, active Pachic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Datemark gravelly loam, in an area of coniferous forest. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 inch to 1; partly decomposed needles, leaves and twigs.

    A1--1 to 12 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine and few medium and coarse roots; many very fine vesicular pores; 20 percent pebbles and 5 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.

    A2--12 to 23 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine and few medium and coarse roots; many very fine tubular pores; 20 percent pebbles and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary.

    Bw--23 to 37 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine and few medium and coarse roots; many very fine tubular pores; 25 percent pebbles and 25 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt irregular boundary.

    R--37 inches; fractured limestone bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION: Tooele County, Utah, approximately 7 miles west and 9 miles south of Clover, about 300 feet east and 800 feet north of the southwest corner of sec. 33, T. 6 S., R. 6 W; USGS Onaqui Mountains South 7.5 minute topographic quadrange; 40 degrees 14 minutes 51 seconds north latitude and 112 degrees 31 minutes 59 seconds west longitude, NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture moisture regime is udic.
Mean annual soil temperature is 35 to 45 degrees F

Depth to lithic contact: 20 to 40 inches to limestone bedrock.
Depth to cambic horizon: 14 to 25 inches
Thickness of the mollic: 16 to 37 inches

Particle-size control section (weighted average): 
Clay content: 18 to 27 percent
Rock fragments: 35 to 70 percent

A Horizons:
Value: 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist. 
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist. 
Rock fragments: 15 to 35 percent.
Reaction= slightly acid or neutral.

Bw Horizon:
Chroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist. 
Rock fragments: 35 to 70 percent.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: colluvium and residuum derived from limestone.
Landform: mountain slopes.
Slopes: 30 to 70 percent.
Elevation: 6000 to 11000 feet.
Mean annual temperature: 35 to 45 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 22 to 35 inches.
Frost-free period: 20 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Flygare, Lundy and Podmore series. The Flygare soils very deep and are on mountainsides. The Lundy soils are shallow and are on mountainsides. The Podmore soils are derived from sandstone and quartzite and are on mountainsides.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: well drained, high runoff, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for timber, limited grazing and for watershed. Native vegetation is Douglas-fir, alpine fir, white fir, mountain brome, snowberry and quaking aspen.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: western Utah and eastern Nevada, MLRA 28A; moderately extensive.
