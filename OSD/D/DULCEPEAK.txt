DULCEPEAK SERIES

The Dulcepeak series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived from sandstone and shale.  Dulcepeak soils are on mesas, cuestas and hillslopes.  Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 457 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, smectitic, frigid Vertic Paleustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:   Dulcepeak very cobbly loam, on a southeast facing, convex, 15 percent slope at an elevation of 2,347 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on August 12, 1999, the soil was moist from 0 to 66 cm.

    A--0 to 13 cm; dark gray (7.5YR 4/1) very cobbly loam, black (7.5YR 2.5/1) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic, many very fine roots; 20 percent subangular sandstone gravel, 20 percent angular sandstone cobbles, and 1 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary (3 to 30 cm thick)

    Bt1--13 to 33 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/3) clay, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; strong fine angular block structure; hard,  firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; few very fine tubular pores; many prominent clay films on ped faces; 10 percent angular sandstone cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.

    Bt2--33 to 51 cm; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist; moderate medium and fine angular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common medium and coarse roots; few very fine tubular pores; many prominent clay films on ped faces; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.

    Bt3--51 to 66 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) gravelly clay loam, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; very hard,  firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few medium and coarse roots; few very fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on ped faces; 16 percent subangular sandstone gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 - 23 to 83 cm)

    R--66 cm; hard sandstone bedrock

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana
SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, 2000; Jicarilla Apache Area, Parts of Rio Arriba and Sandoval Counties Soil Survey.  The name Dulcepeak is taken from a local peak name.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  13 to 63 cm (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons)
Argillic horizon:  13 to 66 cm (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons)
Lithic contact:  66 cm to sandstone bedrock (R layer)
Abrupt textural change:  13 cm (the upper boundary of the argillic horizon)
Vertic feature:  based on estimated linear extensibility

Other Features:  Thin Oi horizons are present in some pedons.  Rock fragments generally decrease with depth.

Dulcepeak soils have a frigid temperature regime and are in an ustic soil moisture regime with a typic subclass.
