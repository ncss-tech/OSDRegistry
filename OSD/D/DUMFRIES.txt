DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to very rapid surface runoff and moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of this soil is in hardwood and mixed hardwood and pine forest.  Few areas are used for residential and commercial development.  Few small areas are used for pasture.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Virginia, and Maryland.  Moderate extent; about 6,800 acres are in Prince William County.  Comparable amounts are in Farifax and Stafford Counties.
