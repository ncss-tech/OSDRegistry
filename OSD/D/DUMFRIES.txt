DUMFRIES SERIES

Soils of the Dumfries series are very deep, well drained with moderately rapid permeability.  They formed in feldspathic sandy sediments of the Coastal Plain.  Slopes range from 2 to 55 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Ultic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Dumfries sandy loam on a 15 to 25 percent slope in an oak-hickory type forest.  (Colors are for moist soil).

    O--0 to 1 inch; partially decomposed hardwood leaves and twigs.

    A--1 to 3 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy loam; moderate fine granular structure; very friable; many fine medium and coarse roots; 1 percent rounded quartz gravel; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick)

    E--3 to 11 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy loam; moderate fine granular structure; very friable; many fine, medium and coarse roots; 1 percent rounded quartz gravel; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt1--11 to 24 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) sandy clay loam; weak, fine subangular blocky structure; friable; sticky. slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; common clay bridges between sand grains; 1 percent rounded quartz gravel; strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.

    Bt2--24 to 30 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) sandy loam; common fine and medium very pale brown (10YR 7/3) mottles; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable. sticky; common fine and medium roots; common clay bridges between sand grains; 1 percent rounded quartz gravel; strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.   (Combined thickness of the B horizon ranges from 10 to 30 inches)

    BC--30 to 36 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) sandy loam; common fine and medium very pale brown (10YR 7/3) and few very pale brown (10YR 8/2) mottles; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; slightly  stickly; few fine roots; strongly acid; diffuse boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick)

    C1--36 to 44 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) sandy loam; many coarse mottles and streaks of brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) and few very pale brown (10YR 8/2) mottles; massive; very friable; slightly sticky; few fine roots; strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.) to 20 inches thick)

    C2--44 to 73 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) sandy loam; few fine and medium brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) mottles and streaks; massive; very friable; few lenses of silty clay up to two inches thick; few Fe-Mn concretions; strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Prince William County, Virginia; about 800 feet north-west of Inn Street, about 1/2 mile north of Route 619 and about 150 feet east of Interstate Highway 95.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 18 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 20 feet.  Coarse fragments of rounded quartz gravels ranges from 1 to 15 percent in the solum and from 0 to 10 percent in the C horizon.  Reaction is strongly to very strongly acid unless limed.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 through 4 and chroma of 0 through 2.  It is sandy loam or loam.

The E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is sandy loam or loam.

The Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 6 through 8.  It is sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.  The BC horizons are similar to the Bt and C horizons.

The C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Higher chroma mottles and streaks are common.  Thin lenses up to 3 inches thick of silty clay are common in the C horizon.  Content of feldspar sand ranges from about 25 to 60 percent in the C horizon.  It is loamy sand to sandy loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Athol, Bolton, Bookwood, Brecknock, Carpenter, Culleoka, Door, Dormont, Duffield, Frondorf, Grayford, Hayter, Lamotte, Legore, Loudonville, Morrison, Myersville, Neshaminy, Penn, Ryder, Sudley, Washington, Westmoreland, Wheeling and Williamsburg soils.  The Athol, Carpenter, Door, Hayter and Westmoreland soils have sandstone and shale coarse fragments.  The Bolton, and Morrison soils have chert rock fragments.  The Duffield soils have more silt than the Dumfries.  The Bookwood, Culleoka, Frondorf, Loudonville, Penn and Ryder soils have bedrock betweem 20 and 40 inches. The Brecknock soils have bedrock from 40 to 60 inches.  The Dormont, Myersville, Neshaminy and Washington soils have hue redder than 7.5 YR.  The Grayford and Lamotte soils have a loess capping.  The Legore soils have diabase and diorite rock fragments.  The Sudley soils are weathered from Triassic-Jurassic sandstone and conglomerate and have rock fragments of these in the solum.  The Wheeling soils are on river terraces and underlain with sand or sand and grave.  The Williamsburg soils have a solum more than 60 inches thick.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dumfries soils are on narrow ridges and side slopes in the northern part of the Atlantic Coastal Plain.  These soils developed in sandy feldspathic sediments in highly dissected Coastal Plain terraces.  Slope ranges from 2 to 55 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 42 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 59 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  The dominant associated soils are the Lunt, Marr, Neabsco and Quantico soils.  The Lunt soils have a higher content of clay and have montmorillonitic minerology.  The Marr soils have a higher content of siliceous very fine sand.  The Neabsco soils have a fragipan.  The Quantico soils have a clayey control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to very rapid surface runoff and moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of this soil is in hardwood and mixed hardwood and pine forest.  Few areas are used for residential and commercial development.  Few small areas are used for pasture.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Virginia, and Maryland.  Moderate extent; about 6,800 acres are in Prince William County.  Comparable amounts are in Farifax and Stafford Counties.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Prince William County, Virginia; 1985.

REMARKS:  This soil has been previously included with miscellaneous land types and Sassafras and Galestown soils.  Sassafras and Galestown have siliceous mineralogy.  The 2021 revision changed depths for individual horizons to allow O horizon to be top of pedon.
