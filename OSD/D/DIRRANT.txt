TAXONOMIC CLASS: 

TYPICAL PEDON: Dirrant peat- on a slope of 4 percent under sedge/lichen dwarf scrub. (All colors are for moist soil)

	Oi--0 to 5 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) peat; many very fine and fine roots; very strongly acid (pH 5.1); gradual smooth boundary.

	Oe--5 to 13 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) mucky peat; many very fine and fine roots; very strongly acid (pH 5.2); abrupt smooth boundary.

	Cg--13 to 17 inches; very dark gray (5Y 3/1) gravelly loam; friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; 15 percent gravel, 2 percent cobbles; strongly acid (pH 5.2); abrupt smooth boundary.

	Cgf--17 to 60 inches; very dark gray (5Y 3/1) permanently frozen gravelly loam; 15 percent gravel, 2 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6).

COMPETING SERIES: This is Boldrin and Kuswash series Boldrin and Kuswash soils lack visible mica.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landforms: till plains
Parent material: silty eolian deposits over gravelly alluvium
Elevation: 387 to 778 feet
Slope: 0 to 6 percent
Annual precipitation: 21 to 29 inches
Annual temperature: 24.8 degrees F
Frost-free period: 60 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Distin, Imuruk, and Tisuk soils. Distin soils are poorly drained, moderately deep to very deep to permafrost, and occur on circles on till plains. Imuruk soils are very deep, somewhat excessively drained, and occur on hills and outwash plains. Tisuk soils are well drained, very deep, and occur on hills, mountain, and till plains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained, very high runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high to very high in the organic layers, moderately high to high upper part of the underlying layer, and very low in the permafrost.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for military use and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is sedge/lichen dwarf scrub.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 240, Nulato Hill-Southern Seaward Peninsula Highlands, Alaska. The series is of small extent.
