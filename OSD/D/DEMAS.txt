Trappe soils--have underlying layers with chroma of 3 or more, at slightly shallower water depths

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain Estuaries
Landform: Washover fan flats, washover fan slopes, and shallow barrier coves (These landforms receive fresh sands after each major winter storm and/or tropical disturbance)
Parent Material: Sandy lagoonal deposits with origins from barrier island eolian sand deposition

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:

Indian River soils-are on flood-tidal delta flats and slopes associated with current day tidal inlets or inactive inlets and have sulfidic materials usually deeper in their profiles
Southpoint soils--have buried organic materials within 40 inches (100 centimeters) of the surface; at deeper water depths
Sinepuxent soils--have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section and contain sulfidic materials, at shallower water depths
Tizzard soils--have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section, have underlying layers with chroma of 3 or more, at slightly shallower water depths
Queponco soils--have layers with chroma of 3 or more, at slightly shallower water depths
Purnell soils--have surface organic layers 8 to 15 inches thick and are not permanently submersed; on adjacent tidal marshes

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses: Most areas are vegetated and function as estuarine benthic wildlife habitat.  Benthic fauna such as tubeworms, clams, juvenile blue crabs, scallops and juvenile finfish are common.
Dominant Vegetation: Native vegetation includes rooted algae, eelgrass (Zostera marina) and widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima).  Vegetative cover ranges from 20 to 90 percent.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Mid-Atlantic coastal estuaries of Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, and possibly Virginia.  This series is of small extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Worcester County, Maryland, 2017.

REMARKS: Demas soils were formerly included with miscellaneous areas of water.  They are distinguished by being permanently covered by estuarine waters that support submersed aquatic vegetation.   The initial name proposed for this series was Wallops.  Refer to Ph.D. dissertations on file at the University of Maryland, College Park, MD.  (1) Subaqueous Soil Survey of Sinepuxent Bay, Maryland; George P. Demas, July 1998.  And (2) Pedogenesis, Inventory, and Utilization of Subaqueous Soils in Chincoteague Bay, Maryland by Danielle M. Balduff, 2007.

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 9 inches (0 to 22 centimeters) (Ase horizons)
Peraquic feature--the zone from 0 to 85 inches (0 to 215 centimeters) is permanently saturated
