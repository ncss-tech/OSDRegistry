DEVAUL SERIES

The Devaul series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from basalt and tuff.  Devaul soils are on plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TYPE LOCATION:  Klamath County, Oregon; about 1 mile east of Gerber Reservoir, 0.5 mile north of Casebeer Spring, and 100 yards east of the CCC road; 2,400 feet south and 1,400 feet east of the northwest corner of section 4, T. 39 S., R. 14 E.; USGS Gerber Reservoir 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; 42 degrees 13 minutes 02 seconds north latitude and 121 degrees 04 minutes 14 seconds west longitude, NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Usually moist in winter and spring, dry in summer and fall; xeric moisture regime that borders on aridic.

Mean annual soil temperature - 45 to 47 degrees F.

Mean summer soil temperature - 59 to 61 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Clanalpine, Heechee, Holmes, Horrocks, Hoskin, Howcan (T), Pequop, Moreypeak, Suak, Valmar, Vitale, and Wambolt (T) series.

Clanalpine and Moreypeak soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Heechee, Holmes, Howcan, Pequop, and Wambolt soils are very deep.  Horrocks soils are deep to lithic contacts and have the base of the argillic within 14 to 40 inches.  Hoskin, Suak, Valmar, and Vitale soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Devaul soils are on plateaus.  They typically occur on toeslope positions.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from basalt and tuff.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 4,800 to 5,100 feet.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 17 to 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F., mean January temperature is 25 to 28 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is 56 to 60 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Casebeer, Dranket, and Norcross soils.  Casebeer and Norcross soils are clayey, shallow to duripans over bedrock, and have argillic horizons.  Dranket soils are fine, moderately deep to duripans over bedrock, and have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium or high surface runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Devaul soils are used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  The native vegetation is Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, mountain big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, and western juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Oregon. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 21.
