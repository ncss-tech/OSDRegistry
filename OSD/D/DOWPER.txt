DOWPER SERIES

The Dowper series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in a deep volcanic ash mantle over residuum from basalt. They are on hills. Permeability is moderately slow and slopes range from 15 to 40 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 37 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees.

BC horizon present in some pedons

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Jacot, Mackatie and Tamara series. Jacot soils lack parafragments and have less than 19 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Mackatie soils are deep to a paralithic contact. Tamara soils lack parafragments and have at least 20 inches of andic material mantling the surface.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dowper soils are on hills at elevations of 2,900 to 3,400 feet with slopes of 15 to 40 percent. These soils formed in volcanic ash over residuum from Saddle Mountain basalt. The average annual temperature is 38 to 44 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is 35 to 45 inches. The frost free season is 50 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Grangemont, Placer and Bargamin  soils. Bargamin and Grangemont soils are on hills and lack coarse fragments in the control section. Placer soils are on hills, have a mixed ash mantle and are deep to paralithic contact.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, very slow to medium runoff and moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, watershed and recreation. Potential natural vegetation is western red cedar, grand fir, western larch, Douglas-fir and western white pine, with an understory of wild ginger, queencup beadlily, longtube twinflower, goldthread, bunchberry dogwood, starry false Solomons seal and common beargrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North central Idaho. Dowper soils are not extensive.
