DIETRICH SERIES

The Dietrich series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy sediments of late Pleistocene age.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on the Ingleside Barrier strand plain of the South Texas Coastal Plain.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (71 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 in).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Aransas, Arenisco, Arrada, Barrada, Edroy, and Narta series.
Aransas soils: are clayey throughout and are on lower flood plains.
Arenisco soils: are sandy throughout, have a water table 102 to 203 cm (40 to 80 in) below the soil surface, and are on higher landforms.
Arrada soils: have salic horizons and are on wind-tidal flats.
Barrada soils: have a fine particle-size control section, have a salic horizon, and are on the wind-tidal flats.
Edroy soils: have a fine particle-size control section and are in enclosed depressions.
Narta soils: have a fine particle-size control section and are on a similar landform.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained.  Permeability is very slow.  Runoff is high on areas less than 1 percent slope and very high on areas of more than 1 percent slopes.  A seasonal perched water table exists from a few days to several weeks from May to September at a depth of 30 to 91 cm (12 to 36 in) from the surface, which includes the E and upper part of the argillic horizon.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used for livestock grazing, and wildlife habitat.  Native grasses are mainly gulf cordgrass, seahorse saltgrass, knotroot bristlegrass, and panicum.  Woody invaders are mainly low mesquite, dwarf liveoak trees, and pricklypear.  A few areas are used as improved pastures of coastal bermudagrass.  The ecological site is Salty Prairie (R150BY551TX).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Gulf Coast Saline Prairies (MLRA 150B in LRR T) in the Coastal Bend of southern Texas.  The series is of moderate extent.
