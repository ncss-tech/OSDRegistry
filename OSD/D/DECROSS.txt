DECROSS SERIES

The Decross series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium from limestone.  Decross soils are on relict alluvial fans, fan aprons, mountain slopes, and pediment toeslopes.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Calcic Pachic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Decross loam-rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 4 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; strong very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

    AB--4 to 9 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) heavy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few faint clay films on faces of peds; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt--9 to 30 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; very hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common faint clay films on faces of peds and in root channels and pores; 5 percent limestone fragments; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 26 inches thick)

    Bk1--30 to 37 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few faint clay films on faces of some peds; slightly effervescent; lime as few soft masses and as crusts on undersides of rock fragments; 5 percent limestone fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Bk2--37 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; massive; hard, very friable; slightly sticky and slightly plastic; violently effervescent, lime as common soft masses and threads and many crusts on undersides of rock fragments; 5 percent limestone fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

TYPE LOCATION:  Johnson County, Wyoming; SE1/4 SE1/4 of sec. 22, T. 46 N., R. 85 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 16 to 40 inches thick.  Depth to the calcic horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 35 to 45 degrees F. and the mean annual summer soil temperature ranges from 49 to 58 degrees F.

The A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  EC is less than 2 mmhos.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent gravel or channers.

The Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam averaging 18 to 35 percent clay.  EC is less than 2 mmhos.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent gravel or channers.

The Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Matrix texture is loam or light clay loam.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent gravel or cobbles.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.  The calcium carbonate equivalent is 15 to 40 percent and decreases by more than 5 percent in some lower horizons.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Wineglass series.  Wineglass soils have Bk horizons with more than 35% rock fragments and have an O horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Decross soils are on mountain slopes, relict alluvial fans, fan aprons, and pediment toeslopes.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium from limestone.  Elevation is 5,600 to 9,000 feet.  The average annual precipitation is about 15 to 24 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 33 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated at 30 to 70 days depending upon elevation, aspect, and air drainage.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Nathrop and Woosley soils.  Nathrop and Woosley soils have limestone at a depth above 40 inches and have mollic epipedons less than 16 inches thick.  Nathrop soils are also loamy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used principally for range, recreation, and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is big sagebrush, Idaho fescue, and King fescue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  High mountainous areas of central Colorado and Wyoming.  The series is of moderate extent. MLRA 43B and 46.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Johnson County (Southern Part), Wyoming; 1971.

Remarks:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are; a mollic epipedon from the surface to 30 inches (A, AB, Bt horizons); an argillic horizon from 9 to 30 inches (Bt horizon); a calcic horizon from 30 to 60 inches (Bk1, Bk2 horizons); a particle-size control section from 9 to 29 inches (Bt horizon). Decross soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
