DOLORES SERIES

The Dolores series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium. colluvium, and alluvium derived dominantly from sandstone.  Dolores soils are on mesas and hills.  Slopes range from 1 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series at the present time. The Maes soils in a closely related family, have mixed clay mineralogy and do not have horizons of secondary carbonates.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium, colluvium, and alluvium derived mostly from sandstone.
Landform:  mesas and hills.
Slopes:  1 to 65 percent
Elevation: 7,100 to 8,600 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  40 to 45 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  15 to 25 inches.
  Wettest months:  July and August receive slightly more precipitation than other months.
  Driest months:  May and June receive the least precipitation, however the soils are still moist from snowmelt into June.
Frost-free period:  75 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Granath, Nortez, and Fardraw series.  
Granath soils have mollic epipedons and have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section and are on mesas.
Nortez soils have a lithic contact of sandstone at 20 to 40 inches and are on mesas.
Fardraw soils have a mollic epipedon and lack carbonates throughout and are on structural benches and mesas.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, low to medium runoff, slow permeability..

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for livestock grazing, timber production, and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is ponderosa pine, Gambel oak, Utah serviceberry, western wheatgrass, prairie junegrass, mountain brome, and mountain muhly. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Colorado.  LRR E, MLRA 48A.  This series is of small extent.
