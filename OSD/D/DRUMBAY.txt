DRUMBAY SERIES

The Drumbay series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, high saturated hydraulic conductivity (rapidly permeable) soils that formed in eolian beach sands. These nearly level soils occur on slightly depressional backdune flats on barrier islands. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1245 mm (49 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (70 degrees F).

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES PROPOSED: Brazoria County, Texas, 2020. The name is derived from a bay near the type location.

REMARKS: The series was formerly included in the Mustang series. The series was separated based on differences in water table depth and salinity.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: 25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in) 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 in) (A horizon) 
Endosaturation and aquic conditions: 40 to 203 cm (16 to 203 in) (C and Cg horizons)

Additional Comments: The depressional nature of these soils is due to storm overwash channeling.

ADDITIONAL DATA: MLRA Soil Survey Office data are available on location S2020TX0397028 at the series type location.
