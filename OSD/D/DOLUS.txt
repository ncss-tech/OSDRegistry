DOLUS SERIES

The Dolus series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum or colluvium from semiconsolidated interbedded sandstone or siltstone.  These soils are on hills and sedimentary plains.  Slopes are 2 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Dolus channery loam, in grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 8 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) channery loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few medium roots and many fine and very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; 20 percent channers; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw--8 to 16 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very channery loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; 40 percent channers; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 18 inches thick)

    Bk--16 to 32 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) very channery loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; weak medium granular structure; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 45 percent channers; continuous faint lime coatings on surface of rock fragments; disseminated lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (14 to 18 inches)

    Cr--32 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) semiconsolidated sandstone and siltstone, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - hills; sedimentary plains.
Elevation - 3,600 to 5,400 feet.
Slope - 2 to 45 percent.
Parent material - residuum or colluvium from semiconsolidated interbedded sandstone and siltstone.

Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 14 inches.
Mean annual temperature - 39 to 44 degrees F.
Frost-free season - 90 to 105 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Dolus soils are used mainly for grazing.  Potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, antelope bitterbrush, Hoods phlox, and other forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Dolus soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.  MLRA 43, 44.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Powell County, Montana, 1995.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT0751.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 8 inches (A horizon); a cambic horizon from 8 to 16 inches (Bw horizon); a horizon of secondary carbonate accumulation from 16 to 32 inches (Bk horizon); a paralithic contact at 32 inches (Cr horizon).  Dolus soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.
