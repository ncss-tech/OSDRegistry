DRY LAKE SERIES

The Dry Lake series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in lacustrine sediments from mixed sources including granodiorite, quartzite, basalt, and limestone. Dry Lake soils are on undulating lower fans, valley plains and playa margins and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 58 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy over loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Sodic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Dry Lake fine sand - idle cropland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    C1--0 to 9 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; single grained; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots; many fine interstitial and few fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; few fine white rounded and irregular shaped lime concretions; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

    C2--9 to 24 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loamy sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; single grained; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; few very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; common fine rounded and irregularly shaped white lime concretions; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear irregular boundary.  (10 to 30 inches thick)

    2Bk--24 to 35 inches; stratified white (10YR 8/2) and very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) and brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; very hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many very fine and fine roots; few fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; 25 to 30 percent irregularly shaped soft lime masses concentrated in laminar strata; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).  (10 to 15 inches thick)

    2Bknz--35 to 60 inches; white (10YR 8/2) loam, very pale brown (10YR 8/2) loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist; massive; very hard, friable, sticky and plastic, few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; 25 to 30 percent irregularly shaped soft lime masses; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dry Lake soils are on undulating lower fans, valley plains and playa margins.  Slopes are dominantly 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in lacustrine sediments from mixed sources including granodiorite, quartzite, basalt, and limestone.  Elevation ranges from 4,170 to 4,300 feet.  The annual precipitation averages about 11 inches.  The mean annual air temperature averages 58 degrees F., the mean January temperature is 41 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is 76 degrees F.  The frost-free period ranges from 180 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Crot, Gothard, Karro and Vinton soils.  Crot and Gothard soils have natric horizons.  Karro soils are fine-loamy and Vinton soils are sandy throughout.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; very slow runoff; rapid permeability in the upper part and slow in the B horizons.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing and irrigated cropland.  Vegetation consists of alkali sacaton, scattered mesquite and annual grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeast Arizona. The series is inextensive. MLRA is 41.
