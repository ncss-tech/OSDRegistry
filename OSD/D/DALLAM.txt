DALLAM SERIES

The Dallam series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in loamy eolian sediments of Pleistocene age.  These soils are on nearly level and gently sloping eolian plains or an interdune on sandhills.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 406 mm (16 in) and mean annual temperature is 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the similar Dalhart, Perico, and Rickmore series and the Dumas, Gruver, Optima, Oslo, Sherm, Sunray, Texline, and Vingo series.
Dalhart, Perico, and Rickmore soils: are on similar landscape positions.
Dumas, Gruver, Oslo, Sherm, Sunray, and Texline soils: are on slightly lower landscape positions and have a mollic epipedon.
Optima soils: are on slightly higher landscape positions and do not have an argillic horizon.
Vingo soils: are on slightly higher landscape positions and have a coarse-loamy particle size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained and moderately permeable.  Surface runoff is negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes and low on 1 to 5 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for crop production but also used for livestock grazing.  Principal crops grown are wheat and grain sorghum.  The plant community for fine sandy loams is short and mid grasses with a lesser tall grass component, mid grasses tend to dominate this site.  The main plant species are sideoats grama, blue grama, and little bluestem, with minor amounts of Indiangrass, vine mesquite, sand dropseed, buffalograss, gauras, catclaw sensitive briar, prairie clover, and sagewort.  Woody plants include catclaw acacia and yucca.  The plant community for fine sands and loamy fine sands is tall and mid grasses with tall grasses tending to dominate.  The major plant species include little bluestem, sand bluestem, sand lovegrass, sand paspalum, and sideoats grama with minor amounts of silver bluestem, sand dropseed, hooded windmillgrass, fall witchgrass, hairy grama, and perennial threeawn.  Woody plants comprise 10 to 20 percent of the plant community and include sand shinoak, sand sagebrush, and skunkbush. This soil has been correlated to the Sandy Loam (R077BY021TX) and Sandy (R077BY658TX) ecological site in MLRA-77B.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern High Plains, Northwestern Part (MLRA 77B in LRR H) of Texas and New Mexico north of the Canadian River.  The series is moderately extensive.
