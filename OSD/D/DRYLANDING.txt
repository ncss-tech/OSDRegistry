DRYLANDING SERIES

The Drylanding series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium over mudstone bedrock on strath terraces or floodplains. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  Permeability is moderate. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is 42 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Drylanding channery silt loam on a slope of 2 percent in a forested area at an elevation of about 940 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

  A--0 to 4 inches; very dusky red (2.5YR 2.5/2) channery silt loam, weak red (2.5YR 4/2) dry; moderate fine subangular structure; friable; many very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; 20 percent channers and 5 percent flagstones; slightly acid; abrupt wavy boundary (1 to 5 inches thick)

  Bw--4 to 12 inches; dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) very channery silt loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; common very fine, fine and medium roots; 50 percent channers and 5 percent flagstones; slightly acid; (4 to 11 inches thick)

  2R--12 inches; reddish brown (2.5YR 4/3) thinly bedded mudstone.

TYPE LOCATION: Burnett County, Wisconsin; 800 feet south and 3120 feet east of the northwest corner of sec. 4, T. 42 N., R. 14 W., USGS Scovils Lake topographic quadrangle; latitude 46 degrees 09 minutes 18 seconds N. and longitude 92 degrees 07 minutes 15 seconds W., NAD 1927.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches. Clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 6 to 18 percent as a weighted average. Fine sand or coarser is greater than 15 percent.  Volume of rock fragments in the particle-size control section range from 35 to 85 percent as a weighted average.  Volume of channers ranges from 25 to 65 percent and volume of flagstones ranges from 10 to 20 percent throughout.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral. 

Some pedons have O horizons with hue of 2.5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3. The material consists mostly of slightly to moderately decomposed leaves and twigs.

The A horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is channery or very channery loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam. 

The Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 3 to 8. Texture is the channery, very channery or extremely channery analogs of silt loam, loam or fine sandy loam. 

The 2R horizon is mudstone bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: loamy alluvium over mudstone bedrock 
Landform: strath terraces or floodplains 
Slope: 0 to 12 percent
Mean annual air temperature: 39 to 45 degrees F 
Mean annual precipitation: 28 to 33 inches 
Frost-free period: 100 to 130 days
Elevation: 900 to 1020 feet

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Beartree, Clemens, Dairyland, and Makwa soils.  The shallow very poorly drained  Beartree soils occur in depressions on the same landscapes as the drylanding soil. The somewhat poorly drained Clemens, moderately well drained Dairyland, and very poorly drained Makwa soils are very deep to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained. Permeability is moderate.  Surface runoff is low to moderate. Flooding is none or occasional.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for woodland.  Native vegetation is mixed deciduous and coniferous forest.Common trees are quaking aspen, white spruce, balsam fir and red maple.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Wisconsin. LRRK, MLRA 91B.  These soils are of small extent.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 7 inches (A and Bw, after mixing).  
Cambic horizon: 4 to 12 inches (Bw ).
