DOWAGIAC SERIES

The Dowagiac series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy outwash overlying sand or gravelly sand outwash on outwash plains, terraces, and valley trains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C (49 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, semiactive, mesic Mollic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Dowagiac loam, on a 2 percent slope in a cultivated field.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 23 cm (9 inches); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) loam; weak medium granular structure; friable; many fine roots; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  [18 to 23 cm (7 to 9 inches) thick]

 E--23 to 28 cm (9 to 11 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam; weak thin platy structure; friable; many fine roots; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  [0 to 10 cm (4 inches) thick]

 Bw--28 to 41 cm (11 to 16 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine roots; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  [0 to 18 cm (7 inches) thick]

 Bt1--41 to 74 cm (16 to 29 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; common fine roots; common thin dark reddish brown (5YR 2.5/2 and 3/2) clay films on faces of peds; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary.  [23 to 48 cm (9 to 19 inches) thick]

 Bt2--74 to 96 cm (29 to 38 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) sandy loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; thin clay films on faces of peds and bridging of sand grains; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  [13 to 30 cm (5 to 12 inches) thick]

 2BC--96 to 127 cm (38 to 50 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) sand; single grain; loose; moderately acid; abrupt irregular boundary.  [0 to 51 cm (20 inches) thick]

 2C--127 to 152 cm (50 to 60 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) sand; single grain; loose; neutral.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dowagiac soils are on outwash plains, terraces, and valley trains.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 12 percent with dominant slopes from 0 to 6 percent.  The Dowagiac soils formed in loamy outwash overlying sand or gravelly sand outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 940 mm (29 to 37 inches).  Mean annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C (49 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  The well drained Kalamazoo and Schoolcraft soils are the most common associated soils.  Somewhat poorly drained Matherton, Brady, and Wasepi soils and the poorly drained or very poorly drained Gilford and Sebewa soils are associated at lower elevations.  The well drained, coarser textured Oshtemo and Boyer are associated on some outwash plains.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained.  Potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium depending upon the slope.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part and high or very high in the lower part. Permeability is moderate in the upper part and rapid in the lower part.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are cultivated.  Principal crops are corn, wheat, oats, beans, and legume grass hay.  A small proportion is in pasture.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  MLRAs 98, 104, and 105 in southern Michigan and southeastern Minnesota.  The series is of moderate extent.
