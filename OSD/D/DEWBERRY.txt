DEWBERRY SERIES 

The Dewberry series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash over alluvium. These soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 2 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy over loamy-skeletal, amorphic over mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Udivitrands 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Dewberry ashy silt loam, forested (colors are for moist soils unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 1 inch; undecomposed and partially decomposed forest litter.  (1 to 2 inches thick) 

    A--1 to 2 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) ashy silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots and common medium and coarse roots; 10 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick) 

    Bw1--2 to 10 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) ashy silt loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine and common medium and coarse roots; 10 percent pebbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 12 inches thick) 

    Bw2--10 to 24 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) gravelly ashy silt loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine to medium and few coarse roots; 20 percent pebbles, 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 16 inches thick) 

    2C1--24 to 39 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely cobbly coarse sandy loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) dry; massive; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and medium and few coarse roots; 40 percent pebbles, 30 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 20 inches thick) 

    2C2--39 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely gravelly sandy loam, light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; massive; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common medium and few coarse roots; 50 percent pebbles, 20 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.8).

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretation Record:  MT1512.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a volcanic ash mantle from 1 to 24 inches (A, Bw1 and Bw2 horizons); an ochric epipedon from the mineral soil surface to 7 inches (A, Bw1 horizons); a particle size control section from 0 to 40 inches below the mineral soil surface (A, Bw1, Bw2 and 2C horizons).  Dewberry soils have a udic moisture regime and a frigid temperature regime.
