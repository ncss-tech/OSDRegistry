DYCE SERIES

The Dyce series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium, slide deposits and/or residuum derived from interbedded shale, siltstone and sandstone. These soils are on hills, escarpments and landslides. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Aridic Paleustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Dyce loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

   A--0 to 5 cm; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) loam, dark olive brown (2.5Y 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium platy structure parting to weak very fine and fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots throughout; many very fine and fine vesicular pores throughout; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 10 cm thick)

   Bt--5 to 28 cm; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; strong medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine roots throughout; common very fine and fine dendritic tubular pores throughout; many prominent clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual wavy boundary. (15 to 40 cm thick)

   Btk--28 to 43 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) clay loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots throughout; common very fine and fine dendritic tubular pores throughout; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent gravel; finely disseminated calcium carbonate and many fine and medium irregular soft masses of calcium carbonate throughout; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 36 cm thick)

   Bk--43 to 66 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots throughout; common very fine and fine dendritic tubular pores throughout; 5 percent gravel; finely disseminated calcium carbonate and many fine and medium patchy soft masses and threads of calcium carbonate throughout; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual wavy boundary. (15 to 40 cm thick)

   Cr--66 cm; semi-consolidated mixed sedimentary beds.

COMPETING SERIES:
Deepone (MT) - is very deep

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform - hills, escarpments and landslides
Elevation - 1790 to 1985 meters
Slope - 0 to 60 percent
Parent material - colluvium, slide deposits and/or residuum derived from interbedded shale, siltstone and sandstone
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers
Mean annual precipitation - 250 to 360 mm
Mean annual air temperature - 3.5 to 7 degrees C.
Frost-free period - 70 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Cabbart, Delpoint, Udecide and Varney soils. The Cabbart soils are mostly on ridges and are shallow and loamy. The moderately deep Delpoint and Udecide soils are on similar landscape positions as the Dyce soils but are fine-loamy and formed from siltstone or sandstone materials. The Varney soils are very deep and are in valley or drainage positions, they are fine-loamy, and formed from alluvium.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Dyce soils are used mainly for rangeland and wildlife habitat. Potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, western wheatgrass, prairie junegrass, poa (species), prickly pear cactus, big sagebrush, and other grasses and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Dyce soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana. MLRAs - 43B, 44B.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Horse Prairie-South Valley Area - Part of Beaverhead County, Montana, 2011; proposed in Beaverhead County, Montana, 2004.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
