SERIES ESTABLISHED: Halifax County, Virginia, 2004.

REMARKS: Delila soils were previously mapped as Worsham soils. The creation of a mesic region within the southern Piedmont necessitated a new series be established as a counterpart to the Worsham series. 
Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon)
Aquic conditions--periodic saturation and reduction in a zone from 10 to 60 inches at some time during the year.
Argillic horizon--the zone from 8 to 38 inches ( Btg horizons) 
Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches
