DANGBERG SERIES

The Dangberg series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from granitic rock.  Dangberg soils are on stream terraces and inset fans.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degess C.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dangberg soils are on smooth, linear or slightly concave areas of stream terraces and inset fans.  These soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from granitic rock and partly from other igneous rocks and some metamorphic rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,410 to 1,530 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ormsby and Voltaire soils. Ormsby soils are sandy.  Voltaire soils are fine-loamy and have mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULICCONDUCTIVITY:  Poorly drained; very high surface runoff; very slow permeability; low saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Endosaturation is present with an artesian seasonal high water table between 30 and 90 cm feet (shallow and moderately deep free water occurrence classes) between December and May.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  The drainage in some areas has been altered and may be very poorly drained due to irrigation water perched above the duripan or broken duripans allowing ground water under artesian pressure to rise higher than normal.  Drained phases of this soil are also recognized.  These soils are susceptible to rare flooding for very brief periods year-round or occasional flooding for brief periods between December and March.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Dangberg soils are used for irrigated pasture and urban development.  The vegetation is mainly inland saltgrass, clover, alkali bluegrass, carex, Rumex, and plantain.  Potential native vegetation is black greasewood, basin big sagebrush, basin wildrye, and shadscale.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  These soils are not extensive with about 3,200 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 26.
