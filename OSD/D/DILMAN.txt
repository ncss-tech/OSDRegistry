DILMAN SERIES

The Dilman series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in stratified alluvium derived mainly from tuff, diatomite, and volcanic ash.  Dilman soils are on flood plains and narrow swales.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy over ashy or ashy-pumiceous, mixed over glassy, superactive Aquandic Cryaquolls

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dilman soils are on flood plains and narrow swales.  These soils formed in stratified alluvium derived mainly from tuff, diatomite, and pumiceous volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  Elevations range from 4,100 to 4,400 feet.  The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 18 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 26 degrees F., mean July temperature is about 59 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Klamath, Yonna and Ontko soils.  Klamath soils are fine-silty, lack the Aquandic zone and are on lower landscape positions.  Yonna soils are loamy over ashy or ashy-pumiceous but are also aniso wit loamy material below the ash but above 40 inches.  Ontko soils are fine-loamy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; medium surface runoff; slow permeability in the upper part over rapid permeability in the ashy lower part.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Dilman soils are used for native meadow pasture and hay production.  Areas that are drained and irrigated grow alfalfa and pasture.  The native vegetation is mainly northern mannagrass, Nebraska sedge, Baltic rush, and other wet meadow plants.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Pumiceous ash-mantled areas of central and southern Oregon.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRAs 6 and 21.
