DULLKNIFE SERIES

The Dullknife series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium or residuum derived from limestone.  Dullknife soils are on mountain flanks, alluvial fans, and sideslopes of hills.  Slopes range from 6 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcidic Argiustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Dullknife loam, on an east facing, linear-linear 20 percent slope in bluebunch wheatgrass and western wheatgrass at an elevation of 6,396 feet. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

	A--0 to 2 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine and very fine interstitial pores; about 10 percent channers; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 5 inches thick)

	Bt--2 to 9 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) channery loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common fine and very fine interstitial and tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; about 20 percent channers; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 13 inches thick)

	Bk1--9 to 15 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) channery loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine interstitial and tubular pores; about 30 percent channers; disseminated lime; common fine masses and threads of lime; common distinct lime coatings on fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary.

	Bk2--15 to 25 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) extremely channery loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common very fine interstitial and tubular pores; about 60 percent channers; disseminated lime; common fine masses of lime; common distinct lime coatings on fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (Combined Bk horizons 6 to 28 inches thick)  

	R--25 inches; hard, fractured limestone.

Chroma: 1 to 3
Texture: loam or silt loam 
Clay content: 10 to 25 percent 
Rock fragments: 0 to 20 percent 
Reaction: neutral or slightly alkaline

Bt horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR 
Value: 3 to 5 dry; 2 or 3 moist 
Chroma: 1 to 3 
Texture: loam, silt loam, clay loam or silty clay loam
Clay content: 18 to 30 percent 
Rock fragments: 20 to 50 percent

A thin Btk horizon may be present above the Bk horizon in some pedons and have properties of both the Bt and Bk.

Bk horizons:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR 
Value: 4 to 7 dry; 3 to 6 moist 
Chroma: 2 to 4 
Texture: loam or silt loam 
Clay content: 18 to 25 percent 
Rock fragments: 30 to 70 percent 
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 15 to 40 percent 
Reaction: slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Circleville, Ipson, Sieben, Uracca and Widtsoe series.

Circleville soil:  are moderately deep to hard volcanic rock.
Ipson, Sieben, Uracca and Widtsoe soils:  do not have a lithic contact above a depth of 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material - alluvium, colluvium or residuum derived from limestone. 
Landform: mountain flanks, alluvial fans, and sideslopes of hills. 
Slopes: 6 to 30 percent.
Elevation: 5,400 to 6,500 feet.
Mean annual air temperature: 36 to 45 degrees F. 
Mean annual precipitation: 15 to 19 inches. 
Frost-free period: 70 to 105 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Cloud Peak series.  The Cloud Peak soil has a cryic soil temperature regime and is in high lying timbered areas along the mountain flank. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium to high runoff; moderate high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Dullknife soils are used for rangeland, recreation, and wildlife habitat.  Potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, western wheatgrass, threadleaf sedge, lupine, and needleandthread.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Dullknife soils are of small extent in northeastern Wyoming.
