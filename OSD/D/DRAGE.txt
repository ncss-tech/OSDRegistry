DRAGE SERIES

The Drage series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed igneous and metamorphic rock.  Drage soils are on alluvial fans and hills and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Drage gravelly loam - on 3 percent east-facing slope at an elevation of 5,800 feet in rangeland.  When described on October 4, 1978, the soil was dry throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

       A--0 to 8 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist, weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

	BAt--8 to 14 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 15 percent gravel; few faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 7 inches thick)

       Bt1--14 to 25 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 35 percent gravel; many faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary.

       Bt2--25 to 30 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; many faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 13 to 30 inches thick.)

       Bk--30 to 61 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) extremely gravelly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; 50 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; violently effervescent; (10 percent calcium carbonate); slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Drage soils are on alluvial fan and hills.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,800 to 7,050 feet.  The soil formed in alluvium from mixed igneous and sedimentary rocks with an influence of loess in some areas.  The average annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches, most of which falls as snow or early spring rain.  The average annual temperature is about 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 60 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  They are Goodington, Little Wood, Molyneux, and Vitale soils.  Goodington soils have more than 35 percent clay in the Bt and are on basalt plains.  Little Wood soils have a base saturation of 50 to 75 percent in some part above 75 cm.  Molyneux soils have fine-loamy control sections.  Vitale soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches and are on south- and west-facing mountainsides.  Molyneux soils are on similar landscapes as are Drage soils.  Little Wood soils occur on stream terraces.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is moderately slow.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for range, hay and pasture and some small grains.  Vegetation is basin big sage, mountain big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, and Idaho fescue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Drage soils are inextensive in south-central and southeastern Idaho.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Blaine County, Idaho, 1985.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series are:

Mollic epipedon - occurs from the soil surface to approximately 14 inches (A and BAt horizons).

Argillic horizon - zone from approximately 14 to 30 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).

Secondary accumulations of calcium carbonate - occurs at approximately 30 inches (Bk horizons).

Where this soil is mapped in southeastern Idaho the parent material is influenced by loess or silty alluvium from loess.
