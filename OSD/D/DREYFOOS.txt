DREYFOOS SERIES

The Dreyfoos series consists of very deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in sandy eolian deposits of Holocene age.  These soils are on undulating to hummocky sand dunes emplaced on floodplains, stream terraces, hillslopes, and colluvial aprons of the Southern High Plains, Breaks (MLRA 77E).  The slope ranges from 3 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm (21 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, thermic Aridic Ustipsamments
