MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: York County, South Carolina, 2009. 

REMARKS: This series was proposed in York County, South Carolina in 2008 to replace the Dogue series as mapped in MLRA 136 thermic. The Dogue series is limited to the Coastal Plain region.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to 7 inches (A horizon).
Argillic horizon--The zone from 7 to 60 inches (Bt horizon).
Aquic conditions--periodic saturation and reduction in a zone from 20 to 200 inches of the soil surface at some time during the year (endosaturation)
