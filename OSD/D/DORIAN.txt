DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Distribution: South Carolina and North Carolina, and possibly Virginia, and Georgia
Extent: Moderate

SERIES ESTABLISHED: York County, South Carolina, 2009.

REMARKS: This series was proposed in York County, South Carolina in 2008 to replace the Dogue series as mapped in MLRA 136 (thermic part) and 133A. The Dogue series is limited to the Lower Coastal Plain region. The January 2026 revision changed the formatting.  No data was changed.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches) (A horizon).
Argillic horizon--The zone from 18 to 152 centimeters (7 to 60 inches) (Bt horizon).
Aquic conditions--periodic saturation and reduction in a zone from 51 to 76 centimeters (20 to 30 inches) of the soil surface at some time during the year (endosaturation)
