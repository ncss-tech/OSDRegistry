SERIES ESTABLISHED: Spokane County, Washington; 2012

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features in this pedon
*Mollic epipedon--zone from surface to a depth of 71 cm; meets criteria for pachic
*Cambic horizon--zone from 71 to 122 cm
*Vitrandic feature--zone from surface to a depth of 71 cm
*Depth to lithic contact--122 cm
*Particle-size control section--zone from 25 to 100 cm

The Ritter series appears to be very similar to this series. It should be investigated further to determine vitrandic features.
