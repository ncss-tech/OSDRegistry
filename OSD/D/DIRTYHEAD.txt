DIRTYHEAD SERIES

The Dirtyhead series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived dominantly from calcareous siltstone, shale, and sandstone. They are on terraces, hillsides and mountainsides. Permeability is moderate. Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Calcixerepts 

TYPICAL PEDON: Dirtyhead very gravelly loam, rangeland; on a slope of 12 percent under grass and shrubs at 5,200 feet. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

       A--0 to 6 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 40 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 12 inches thick) 

       Bk1--6  to 16 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very gravelly loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots; few very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; 20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 45 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 13 inches thick) 

       Bk2--16  to 26 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; 25 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 55 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 12 inches thick) 

       Bk3--26  to 38 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; 20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 60 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2). (4 to 14 inches thick) 

       Cr--38 inches; weakly consolidated calcareous sandstone.

COMPETING SERIES:
 Argora (T ID) - are very deep.
Chausse (T ID) - are very deep.
Cutoff (UT) - have hues redder than 10YR throughout the profile and the average annual soil temperature is less than 43 degrees F. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dirtyhead soils are on mountainsides, hills, and terraces. Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent. Elevations are 4,800 to 7,125 feet. The soils formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived dominantly from calcareous, siltstone, shale, and sandstone. Average annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches. Average annual air temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 70 to 90 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Collinston, Huffman, Wheelon, and Wursten soils. Collinston, Huffman, and Wheelon soils are fine-silty. Collinston and Huffman soils have a mollic epipedon. Wursten soils are coarse-loamy and have a mollic epipedon. Collinston, Huffman, and Wursten soils are on broad terraces and side slopes. Wheelon soils are on side slopes and ridges. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to rapid runoff; permeability is moderate. 

USE AND VEGETATION: The soil is used principally for dryland crops and rangeland. Vegetation is mainly basin big sage, mountain sagebrush, low sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, bitterbrush, and prairie junegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: These soils are not extensive in southeast Idaho.
