DUSTON SERIES

The Duston series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial outwash and alluvium of mixed mineralogy. Duston soils occur on plane to irregular outwash plains, terraces, and alluvial fans with slopes of 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed Typic Dystrocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Duston sandy loam, forested. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; undecomposed pine needles, twigs, leaves, and stems; slightly acid (pH 6.2). (1/2 to 4 inches thick)

    Oe--2 to 3 inches; partially decomposed organic material; slightly acid (pH 6.2). (1/2 inch to 1 1/2 inches thick)

    A--3 to 5 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak very fine and fine granular; soft, very friable; slightly sticky; many fine roots; slightly acid (pH 6.3); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 2 inches thick)

    Bw1--5 to 8 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak very fine and fine granular; soft, very friable; many fine roots; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt wavy boundary. (2 to 8 inches thick)

    Bw2--8 to 12 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable; many fine roots; slightly acid (pH 6.1); gradual wavy boundary. (2 to 10 inches thick)

    C1--12 to 46 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loamy sand; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable; many very fine roots; slightly acid (pH 6.3); gradual smooth boundary. (10 to 40 inches thick)

    C2--46 to 60 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) coarse sand; brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; single grain; loose; few very fine roots; slightly acid (pH 6.2).

TYPE LOCATION: Valley County, Idaho; about 1.5 miles northeast of McCall; 1,320 feet north and 1,000 feet east of the southwest corner of sec. 3, T.18N., R.3E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The 10- to 40-inch control section is loamy coarse sand or loamy sand. The solum contains 0 to 5 percent stones and 5 to 15 percent pebbles. The moist hue is typically 10YR but includes 7.5YR. The mean annual soil temperature is about 43 degrees to 45 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature is about 56 degrees to 59 degrees F.

The A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.

The Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is coarse sandy loam or sandy loam.

The C horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 through 4. It is loamy sand or loamy coarse sand in the upper part, and below 35 inches stratified loamy coarse sand, sand, and coarse sand.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Anchorpark, Beales, and Bottle series. Anchorpark soils have an albic horizon and mean annual temperature of 29 to 43 degrees F. Beales soils have a lithologic discontinuity and mean annual temperature of 24 to 28 degrees F. Bottle soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Duston soils are on glacial outwash plains.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kangas, McCall, and Melton series. Kangas soils have an A horizon more than 10 inches thick and are gravelly throughout the solum. McCall soils are loamy-skeletal. Melton soils are poorly drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow runoff, moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for forestry and pasture. Vegetation is mainly lodgepole pine and pinegrass with scattered ponderosa pine and aspen; understory is wild strawberry, huckleberry, geranium, princess pine and other grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Occurs on recent outwash plains near the Payette lakes and along streams in Valley County, Idaho. The soils are not extensive.
