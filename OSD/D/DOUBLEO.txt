DOUBLEO SERIES

The Doubleo series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium over lacustrine deposits derived from igneous rock.  Doubleo soils are on depressions of low stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  At present, there are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Doubleo soils are on depressions of low stream terraces. These soils formed in alluvium over lacustrine deposits derived from igneous rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 4,100 to 4,200 feet.  The climate is characterized by cold, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ausmus, Skidoosprings, Fury, Housefield, Mcbain, and Skunkfarm soils.  Ausmus, Skidoosprings, and Mcbain soils are on adjacent high lake terraces and have ochric epipedons.  Skunkfarm soils are on high stream terraces and are somewhat poorly drained.  Housefield soils are on low stream terraces and are very poorly drained.  Fury soils are fine-silty and are on adjacent high stream terraces.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; negligible surface runoff; very slow permeability in the upper part of the profile and moderately rapid permeability in the lower part.  These soils are frequently ponded for long duration from March through July with water up to 1 foot deep.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Doubleo soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is cattail and hardstem bullrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Oregon.  These soils are not extensive with about 6,000 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 23.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 10 inches (Ak and Bk horizons).

Vertic features - The zone from 10 to 20 inches with intersecting slickensides and the zone from 3 to 20 inches with cracks over 5 millimeters in width (Bk and Bkss horizons).

Fluventic feature - The zone from 28 to 50 inches with an irregular decrease in organic-carbon content (2C1 and 2C2 horizons).

Aquic conditions - Endosaturation and iron reduction occur within 20 inches of the soil surface in most years.

Major lithologic discontinuity - The abrupt change to loamy material at about 28 inches (2C1 and 2C2 horizons).

A strongly contrasting particle-size class is within a depth of 40 inches.

Particle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (Bkss and B'k horizons and part of the 2C1 horizon).
