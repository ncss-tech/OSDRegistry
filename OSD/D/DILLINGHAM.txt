DILLINGHAM SERIES

The Dillingham series consists of sandy, very deep, well drained glaciofluvial deposits on disintegration moraines. Permeability is moderately rapid in the upper part of the subsoil, slow in the fragipan, and moderately rapid in the substratum. Slopes range from 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, isotic, frigid Typic Fragiorthods

TYPICAL PEDON: Dillingham loamy sand on a 11 percent slope in a forested area. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated).

    Oe-- 0 to 1 inches; partially decomposed leaf litter; weak medium granular structure; friable; common fine and medium roots; extremely acid; abrupt smooth boundary.

    E-- 1 to 8 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) loamy sand, pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine to coarse roots; 1 percent cobbles; extremely acid; abrupt irregular boundary. (3 to 8 inches thick)

    Bhs-- 8 to 11 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) loamy sand; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine to coarse roots; 1 percent cobbles; extremely acid; abrupt irregular boundary. (1 to 5 inches thick)

    Bs--11 to 21 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) loamy fine sand; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine to coarse roots; 1 percent cobbles; extremely acid; abrupt irregular boundary. (6 to 14 inches thick)

    (E/B)x--21 to 31 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) fine sand, pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) dry (E); occupies about 60 percent of the horizon surrounding peds of reddish brown (5YR 5/4) loamy fine sand (Bt); weak thick platy structure; very firm; common fine and medium roots in cracks; few thin clay films on faces of peds; many fine and medium vesicular and tubular pores; 1 percent gravel and 1 percent cobbles; extremely acid; clear wavy boundary. (8 to 24 inches thick)

    C--31 to 80 inches; reddish brown (5YR5/4)  and pinkish gray (5YR 6/2) sand, with reddish brown (2.5YR5/4) loamy fine sand bands; massive parting to weak thick platy fragments inherent from deposition; firm; 1 percent gravel and 1 percent cobbles; extremely acid.

TYPE LOCATION: Luce County, Michigan; about 13 miles northwest of the village of McMillan; 1750 feet east and 2100 feet north of the southwest corner sec. 29, T. 48 N., R. 12 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the fragipan is 18 to 26 inches.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent throughout the pedon.  Cobble content ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout the pedon.  Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid in the solum and extremely acid to moderately acid in the substratum.

The E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or sand.

The Bhs horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value and chroma of 2 or 3. It is loamy fine sand or loamy sand.

The Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is loamy fine sand or loamy sand.

The E part of the (E/B)x has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is loamy sand, fine sand, or sand.  The B part of the (E/B)x has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4. It is loamy sand or loamy fine sand, or rarely sandy loam.

The C horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loamy sand or sand with thin loamy sand or loamy fine sand bands.

COMPETING SERIES: There are none.  The closely related Tokiahok soils have an argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dillingham soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits or sandy till deposits on disintegration moraines. Slope gradients range from 0 to 70 percent slopes.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 32 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 41 to 43 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Carbondale, Dawson, and Kalkaska.  The very poorly drained Carbondale and Dawson soils in depressions and bogs.  The somewhat excessively drained Kalkaska soil is on similar landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained.  Permeability is slow in the fragipan and moderately rapid in the rest of the pedon.  Runoff is very low to medium, dependent on slope.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is forested with sugar maple, American beech, quaking aspen, and paper birch.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Upper Peninsula of Michigan (MLRA 94B).  This series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Luce County, Michigan, 2005.  Source of name is a lake in Luce County.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon are: albic horizon - the zone from 1 to 8 inches; fragipan - the zone from 21 to 31 inches (E/B)x horizon); spodic horizon - the zone from 8 to 21 inches (Bhs and Bs horizons).
