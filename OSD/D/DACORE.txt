DACORE SERIES

The Dacore series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and slope alluvium derived from andesite, dacite, basalt, and tuff. Dacore soils occur on coalescent alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 275 mm (11 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderate permeability; moderately high or high Ksat class.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for irrigated cropland and range. The native vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, Indian ricegrass, annual forbs and grasses, and some pinyon pine and Utah juniper. Irrigated crops are alfalfa, barley and pasture.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Grass Valley near Koosharem in Sevier and Piute Counties, Utah. MLRA 47. The series is moderately extensive.

REMARKS:  
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: The zone from 4 to 15 inches (10 to 38 cm.) (Bt and Btk horizons)
Mollic epipedon: The zone from the surface of the soil to 15 inches (38 cm.) (A, Bt, Btk horizons)
Argillic horizon: The zone from 4 to 15 inches (10 to 38 cm.) (Bt, Btk horizons)

Calcic horizon: The zone from 15 to 38 inches (38 to 97 cm.) (Bk horizons)

The concept for this series has been narrowed to the Utah semidesert zone at about 8 to 12 inches (200 to 300 mm) of precipitation.  Previously, the Utah upland zone at greater than 12 inches (300 mm) of precipitation was included. The moisture regime is aridic bordering ustic consistent with the native vegetation and conceptual break, but is influenced by considerable winter moisture as well.

The cation exchange activity class was inferred from laboratory data from similar soils in the soil survey area.
