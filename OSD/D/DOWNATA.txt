DOWNATA SERIES

The Downata series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in silty alluvium derived from mixed sources. Permeability is moderately slow. These soils are on flood plains and low stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 1 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid Cumulic Endoaquolls

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bigstone, Bloomington, Halleck, Homefield, Inkom, Lamoure, Opie, Playmoor, and Rauville series.  Bigstone soils and Bloomington soils are saturated in the moisture control section for more than 20 days following the summer solstice in most years.  Halleck soils lack buried horizons.  Homefield soils have a calcic horizon and a 2C horizon at 40-60 inches.  Inkom soils average 18-27 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Lamoure soils are somewhat poorly drained and have a mollic epipedon with chroma of 1 or less.  Opie soils have a calcic horizon and a 2C horizon with 10-30 percent gravel.   Playmoor soils have salt accumulations (4 to 16 mmhos/cm), including gypsum, in the upper 20 inches.  Rauville soils are saturated in the soil moisture control section during the 120 days following the summer solstice, and have chroma of 1 or less to a depth greater than 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Downata soils are on flood plains and low stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. They formed in silty alluvium derived from mixed sources. The average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches, and the average annual temperature ranges from 41 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is about 80 to 100 days. Elevation ranges from 4,500 to 4,800 feet. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the  Bear Lake,  Tendoy (T), and the competing  Inkom soils. Bear Lake soils lack buried horizons and have a calcic horizon. Tendoy soils are organic and are on slightly lower positions on flood plains. Inkom soils are on slightly higher positions on flood plains and terraces and are better drained. Bear Lake soils are on nearly the same landscape position but the micro-relief is generally slightly convex. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly and very poorly drained; runoff is very slow or ponded; permeability is moderately slow. These soils are frequently flooded and/or ponded from January through June for brief periods of 3 to 5 days. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for meadow hay and pasture. Most Downata soils have been drained so that hay can be harvested. Potential natural vegetation is grasses, sedges, and rushes. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern, Idaho. This series is inextensive.
