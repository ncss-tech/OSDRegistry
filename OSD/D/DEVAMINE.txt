COMPETING SERIES: This is the Diaspar and Summerford series. Diaspar soils have a MAST of 17 to 22 degrees C and the lower part of the argillic horizon has loamy sand textures. Summerford soils have a moisture control section with more than 20 days of moisture between July and September and the lower part of the argillic horizon has loamy sand textures. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Devamine soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. The soils formed in alluvium from granitoid. Elevation ranges from 1300 to 1550 meters (4300 to 5100 feet). The mean annual precipitation is 175 to 225 mm (7 to 9 inches). The mean annual air temperature is about 13 to 15 degrees C. The frost free period is 250 to 280 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Boomerang (T) and Grottohill (T) series. Boomerang soils are on fan aprons and inset fans, and have sandy particle size control sections. Grottohill soils are on fan aprons and have a cambic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDROLIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very low runoff on gentle slopes and medium runoff on steeper slopes; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and rangeland. The present vegetation is black brush and black grama. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southeastern California; MLRA 30. These soils are of small extent.
