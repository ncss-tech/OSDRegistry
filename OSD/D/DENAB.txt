DENAB SERIES

The Denab series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from tuff.  Denab soils are on pediments.  Slope ranges from 3 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic, shallow Aridic Calciustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Denab gravelly sandy loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 60 to 80 percent of the surface is covered with fine gravel.

    A--0 to 1 inch; brown (7.5YR 5/2) gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak thin platy structure parting to weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; common very fine irregular and interstitial pores; 20 percent gravel; many calcium carbonate coatings on rock fragments; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick)

    Bk--1 to 7 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; many calcium carbonate coatings on rock fragments and common soft fine and medium calcium carbonate masses; violently effervescent, 15.5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (6 to 15 inches thick)

    Crk--7 to 15 inches; interbedded tuff and calcareous loam; extremely hard; many distinct calcium carbonate coatings on rock fragments; common soft fine and medium calcium carbonate masses; common very fine and fine roots along fractures; clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

    R--15 inches; unweathered tuff.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Denab soils are in the Chihuahuan desert on pediments at elevations of 4,600 to 6,200 feet.  Slope ranges from 3 to 45 percent.  These soils formed from slope alluvium and residuum derived from tuff.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December and January.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 62 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 160 to 210 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Castledome, Cazador, Lesliecreek, Blacktail, Pyeatt, and Terrarossa soils. Castledome soil has greater than 35 percent clay over tuff. Cazador, Lesliecreek, Blacktail, Pyeatt, and Terrarossa soils are all very deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to high runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation includes sideoats grama, black grama, blue grama, threeawn, slim tridens, spikepappus grass and range ratany.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Arizona portion of the Chihuahuan desert. MLRA is 41. Denab soils are of moderate extent.
