REMARKS: Deale soils were formerly included with the Elkton, Othello, and Mattapex series. They are distinguished by being somewhat poorly drained and containing glauconite and/or sulfidic materials. 
Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 30 cm (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 30 to 81 cm (Btg1 and Btg2 horizons)
Aquic conditions--periodic saturation and reduction in the zone from 30 to 200 cm of the soil surface at some time during the year (endosaturation) 
Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Lithologic discontinuities-abrupt textural contacts starting at a depth of 81 cm (2BC horizon through the 5Btgb2 horizon)
Endoaquult feature--redoximorphic features in all layers between the Ap horizon or 25 cm, whichever is deeper, and a depth of 40 cm, with dominant matrix chroma of 1 or less, or of 2 or less with redox concentrations
Aeric feature--dominant chroma of 3 or more between the Ap horizon or 25 cm, whichever is deeper, and 75 cm 
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 200 cm  

ADDITIONAL DATA: Data is available for the Typical Pedon from the Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE; Pedon ID S99MD-003-010. 
Database Information: OSD Data Mapunit ID-393710 developed; Data Mapunit ID--104391; and OSD User Pedon ID-To be developed 

The 12/2007 revision expands the range of characteristics for the Ap, 2BC, BCg, and 2BCg horizons, adjusts the Ksat class, updates the format, and introduces metric units.
