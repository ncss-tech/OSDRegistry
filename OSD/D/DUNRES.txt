DUNRES SERIES

The Dunres series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over residuum derived from basalt. Dunres soils are on lava plateaus. Slopes are 1 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Norcross series. Norcross soils average 45 to 55 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have less than 60 percent volcanic glass in the mollic epipedon. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dunres soils are on lava plateaus and hills. These soils formed in volcanic ash over residuum derived from basalt. Slopes are 1 to 20 percent. Elevations range from 1,310 to 1,640 meters. The climate is semiarid and is characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 460 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Moonbeam, Nuss, and Senra soils. These soils are on plateaus. Moonbeam soils are clayey. Nuss soils are loamy, shallow to lithic contacts, and do not have duripans. Senra soils are ashy. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium surface runoff; slow permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Dunres soils are used for livestock grazing. The vegetation is mountain big sagebrush, Idaho fescue, antelope bitterbrush, western juniper, and bluebunch wheatgrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Oregon. These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 23.
