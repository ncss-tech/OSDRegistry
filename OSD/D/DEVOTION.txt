MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Surry County, North Carolina, 2003.

REMARKS: Devotion soils were previously mapped with the Wateree series. The 04/1997 relocation of the mesic/thermic line in North Carolina and Virginia necessitated the need for the Devotion series as a mesic counterpart.

Diagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 7 inches (A horizon)
Cambic horizon--the zone from 7 to 20 inches (Bw horizon)
Paralithic contact--bedrock contact at 24 inches (Cr layer)
Paralithic materials--the zone from 24 to 45 inches (Cr horizon)

Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 34 inches
