DOOH SERIES

The Dooh series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a strong influence from granitic rocks.  Dooh soils are on fan remnants on mountain valleys.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Dooh very stony coarse sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered with about 5 percent stones, 5 percent cobbles, and 30 percent gravel.

    A--0 to 13 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very stony coarse sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure, soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine, common fine and medium roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 10 percent stones, 5 percent cobbles, and 30 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 25 cm thick)

    Bt1--13 to 38 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly sandy clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine, few medium roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 10 percent cobbles and 40 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary.

     Bt2--38 to 71 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely gravelly sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 20 percent cobbles and 45 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary.  (18 to 38 cm thick)

     Bt3--71 to 152 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely gravelly sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 20 percent cobbles and 45 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bullump, Bullvaro, Burchflat, Camelback, Chrisflat, Demner, Dogbed, Erig, Krenka, Leroman, Lockgate, Murain, Nutval, Snyderville, Softback, Softscrabble, Staberg, Vetagrande, and Vipont series.

Bullump, Camelback, Chrisflat, Dogbed, Krenka, Murain, Snyderville, Softback, and Softscrabble soils have a xeric moisture regime.  Bullvaro soils have mollic epipedons more than 76 cm thick, are strongly influenced by loess in the upper part of the profile, and have 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Burchflat and Vipont soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Demner soils have depth to base of the argillic horizon of 50 to 76 cm from the soil surface and have C horizons dominated by cobbles.  Erig soils have a xeric moisture regime and are deep to lithic contacts.  Leroman and Staberg soils have a xeric moisture regime and are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Lockgate soils have a xeric moisture regime and are deep to paralithic contacts.  Nutval soils have 18 to 25 percent clay and more than 40 percent medium sand through very coarse sand in the particle-size control section.  Vetagrande soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dooh soils are on fan remnants on mountain valleys.  They typically occur on footslope and backslope positions.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a strong influence from granitic rocks.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,045 to 2,445 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 380 mm, the mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 65 to 75 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Slatter and Delmo soils.  Slatter soils have bedrock within 25 cm of the soil surface.  Delmo soils are clayey-skeletal and have mollic epipedons less than 50 cm thick.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; very high surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Dooh soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly antelope bitterbrush, mountain big sagebrush, snowberry, western needlegrass, and Letterman's needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 26.
