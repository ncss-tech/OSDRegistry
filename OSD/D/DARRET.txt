DARRET SERIES

The Darret series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from interbedded shale and sandstone. They are on sedimentary plains and hills. Slopes are 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Darret silty clay loam - native grass (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 4 inches; dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2) silty clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine roots; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt1--4 to 8 inches; dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2) silty clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure that parts to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine roots; continuous distinct clay films on faces of peds; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt2--8 to 13 inches; weak red (2.5YR 4/2) silty clay, dusky red (2.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium and coarse prismatic structure that separates to moderate medium and fine subangular blocky; hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; continuous distinct clay films on faces of peds; many very fine roots; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary (4 to 11 inches thick)

    BC--13 to 19 inches; weak red (2.5YR 4/2) paragravelly clay loam, dusky red (2.5YR 3/2) moist; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine roots; 20 percent shale and soft sandstone fragments; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick)

    BCk--19 to 28 inches; weak red (2.5YR 4/2) paragravely clay loam, dusky red (2.5YR 3/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few roots; strongly effervescent; lime coating on underside of most shale and sandstone fragments and continuous coating on some; about 20 percent shale and sandstone fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick)

    Cr--28 to 60 inches; reddish interbedded soft sandstone and shale; few roots that extend beyond 19 inches are compressed into a horizontal mat between the shale and sandstone layers; moderately effervescent.
