DEMONA SERIES

The Demona series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in sandy and clayey soil materials of Cretaceous age.  These are nearly level to moderately sloping upland soils.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, mixed, active, thermic Aquic Arenic Paleustalfs
