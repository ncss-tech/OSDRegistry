GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ahtna, Chelina, Crosswind, and Tsana soils.
Ahtna soils are well drained soils, have silt loam texture, a calcic horizon starting between 23 and 73cm, they occur on escarpments, bluffs, and river valleys.
Chelina soils have a cambic horizon, have a loess mantle, and occur on river valleys and the relict shorelines of lake plains.
Crosswind soils are poorly drained, have permafrost, have both a histic and mollic epipedon, have a cryoturbated horizon, and occur on river valleys and bluffs in lake plains.
Tsana soils are well drained, have a thin loess mantle over overlying loamy glacial till, and occur on till plains. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class: moderately well drained
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: very high in the Oi horizon, low to moderately low in the C horizons.
Permeability: very rapid in the Oi horizon, very slow in the C horizons
Runoff: very high

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Use: wildlife habitat, recreation, and subsistence
Native vegetation: Siberian alder, willow

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 227 Copper River Basin.
Extent: limited
