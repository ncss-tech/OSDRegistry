DEVINE SERIES

The Devine series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy sediments mixed with  thick beds of Uvalde Gravel of Quaternary age. These nearly level to strongly sloping soils are on high stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 711 mm (28 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 20.5 degrees C (69 degrees F).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for rangeland and as a source of gravel.  Native grasses consist mainly of plains bristlegrass, fall witchgrass, Arizona cottontop, tanglehead, plains lovegrass, red grama, and threeawn.  Woody vegetation includes blackbrush, whitebrush, guajillo, and leathersteam with scattered mesquite, live oak, and pricklypear cactus.
