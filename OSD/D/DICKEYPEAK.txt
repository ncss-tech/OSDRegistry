DICKEYPEAK SERIES

The Dickeypeak series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  The Dickeypeak soils are on fan terraces and stream terraces.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes are 2 to 6 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aquic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Dickeypeak silt loam--on a 2 percent undulating, east aspect at 6,290 feet elevation in rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on September 25, 1987, the water table was at 48 inches, and the soil was moist throughout.)

(5 to 12 inches thick)

    Bkg3--45 to 52 inches; light gray (5Y 7/2) fine sandy loam, olive (5Y 5/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; many fine and medium irregular pores; strongly effervescent (21 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

    BCg--52 to 60 inches; light gray (5Y 7/2) gravelly fine  sandy loam, olive gray (5Y 5/2) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; slightly effervescent; 20 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 12 inches thick)

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dickeypeak soils are on fan terraces and stream terraces.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  Elevations are 4,800 to 6,600 feet.  The climate is cold and moist in winter and spring and cool in summer.  The average annual precipitation is 8 to 11 inches.  Average annual temperature is 37 to 39 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 50 to 75 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Thosand and Whiteknob soils.  Thosand soils are on valley flats and have mollic epipedons 7 to 15 inches thick.  Whiteknob soils are on outwash fans and fan terraces and have a sandy-skeletal particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  Slow runoff. Moderate permeability.  Flooding is rare.  High water table at 1.5 to 3.5 feet from March to August.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland.  The vegetation is black greasewood and basin wildrye.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central Idaho.  These soils are not extensive.
