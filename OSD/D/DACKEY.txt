TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, nonacid Aquic Cryofluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Dickey fine sandy loam - on a 0 percent slope under alder and willow shrub at 1950 feet (594 meters) elevation. (All colors are for moist soil)

    AC/Oe--0 to 7 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) fine sandy loam; weak medium platy structure; very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual smooth boundary. (4 to 9 inches thick)

    C--7 to 18 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) stratified sand through silt with composite texture of sandy loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few common distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) redox concentrations and dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) redox depletions; common very fine, fine and medium roots; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 14 inches thick)

    Cg--18 to 27 inches; dark greenish gray (5GY 4/1) stratified sand through silt, composite texture of sandy loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; reduced matrix; common very fine, fine, and medium roots; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (4 to 15 inches thick)

    2C--27 to 60 inches; variegated extremely gravelly coarse sand; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 50 percent rounded gravel and 15 percent rounded cobble; neutral (pH 7.0).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this family or subgroup.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: stratified loamy alluvium and/or sandy and silty alluvium over gravelly alluvium
Landform: floodplains and low stream terraces
Slopes: 0 to 2 percent
Mean annual temperature: about 26 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: about 16 inches. 
Elevation ranges from 1850 to 2475 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained, negligible or low runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the upper horizons and high to very high in the gravelly underlying material. Dackey soils are subject to flooding.

USE AND VEGETATION: Mostly young balsam poplar forest and willow and alder shrub.  Primary uses of these soils include recreation and wildlife habitat.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 228 Interior Alaska Mountains, Alaska. The soil is moderately extensive.
