DALESBURG SERIES

The Dalesburg series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy and sandy alluvium. These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping flood plains along major streams and rivers. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 585 millimeters.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Clay County, South Dakota, 1995.  The name is from a small settlement in Clay County.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 86 centimeters (Ap, A, Bw, and BC horizons);
ustic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
