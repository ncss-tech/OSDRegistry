DARNELL SERIES

The Darnell series consists of shallow, well drained to somewhat excessively drained soils formed in material weathered from sandstone of Permian age. These soils are on summits and shoulders of low hills in the Cross Timbers (MLRA 84A). Slopes range from 1 to 45 percent. Mean, annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (6l degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 in). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, siliceous, active, thermic, shallow Udic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Darnell fine sandy loam--oak forest at an elevation of 315 m (1032 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.) 

  A--0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 in); brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; many fine roots; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary. (Thickness of the A horizon is 10 to 25 cm [4 to 10 in])

  Bw--13 to 38 cm (5 to 15 in); light brown (7.5YR 6/4) fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; many fine roots; few fragments of sandstone less than 25 mm (1 in) in diameter; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary. (Thickness of the Bw horizon is 10 to 30 cm [4 to 12 in]) 

  Cr--38 to 76 cm (15 to 30 in); red (2.5YR 4/6) sandstone, dark red (2.5YR 3/6) moist; difficult to auger; moderately acid. 

TYPE LOCATION: Lincoln County, Oklahoma; about 8 miles west of Tryon; 900 feet west and 100 feet north of the southeast corner of sec. 17, T. 16 N., R. 2 E.

Longitude 97 degrees, 6 minutes, 33 seconds W 
Datum: NAD 83

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Solum thickness: 25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 in) 
Depth to paralithic contact: 25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 in) 

A horizon: 
Hue: 5YR to 10YR 
Value: 4 to 6, 3 or 4 moist 
Chroma: 2 to 4 dry and moist
Texture: sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or their stony counterparts 
Coarse fragments: amount-0 to 5 percent by volume, size-less than 76 mm (3 in); and 0 to 15 percent by volume, 76 to 250 mm (3 to 10 in); kind-sandstone gravels and stones 
Reaction: strongly acid to neutral 

Bw horizon: 
Hue: 2.5YR to 10YR 
Value: 4 to 8, 3 to 5 moist 
Chroma: 2 to 6 dry and moist
Texture: sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or their gravelly counterparts 
Coarse fragments: amount-0 to 5 percent by volume, size-less than 76 mm (3 in); and 0 to 20 percent by volume, 76 to 250 mm (3 to 10 in); kind-sandstone gravels and stones 
Reaction: strongly acid to neutral 

Cr horizon: 
Hue: 10R to 10YR 
Value: 4 to 7 
Chroma: 3 to 8 
Excavation difficulty: high or very high 
Fractures: greater than 10 cm (4 in) apart 
Other features: This material is dense enough to be root restrictive. Some strata may be lithic with an extremely high excavation difficulty, but these areas are small 
Reaction: strongly acid to neutral 

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Soils in similar families in MLRA 84A are the Bigheart, Darsil, Lucien, and Noble series.
Bigheart soils: are in the thermic Udic soil climate regime 
Darsil soils: have a sandy textural control section 
Lucien soils: have mixed mineralogy and have a mollic epipedon 
Noble soils: have a solum more than 51 cm (20 in) thick 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: sandstone of Permian age 
Landscape: uplands
Landform: very gently sloping to steep ridge crests and upper side slopes of hills on uplands 
Slope: 1 to 45 percent 
Mean Annual Temperature range: 14 to 18 degrees C (58 to 64 degrees F) 
Mean Annual Precipitation range: 711 to 1016 millimeters (28 to 40 in) 
Frost-free period: 181 to 240 days
Elevation: 225 to 400 m (740 to 1315 ft)
Thornthwaite Annual P-E indices: 44 to 64 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Darsil, and Noble series and the Harrah, Littleaxe, Newalla, Niotaze, and Stephenville series. 
Darsil soils: occur intermingled in the same landscape, and have a textural control of loamy fine sand or coarser 
Harrah, Littleaxe, and Stephenville soils: occur on broad flats or side slopes, have an argillic horizon, and have a solum more than 51 cm (20 in thick) 
Newalla and Niotaze soils: occur on steep summits and back slopes, have an argillic horizon, have a fine control section, and have a solum more than 20 in thick 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage: well drained or somewhat excessively 
Runoff: medium or rapid 
Permeability: very high 

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used for rangeland. Native vegetation is mainly post oak, blackjack oak, and eastern red cedar with an understory of tall and mid grasses. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Oklahoma, Kansas, and Texas; LRR J; MLRA 84A; extensive
