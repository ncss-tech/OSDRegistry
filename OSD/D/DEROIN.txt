DEROIN SERIES

The Deroin series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in reddish colored silty material, presumed to be Loveland loess. Deroin soils are on uplands.  Slopes range from 2 to 17 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 34 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F. at the type location.

Morrill soils formed in loamy glacial till or outwash deposits and have more sand in the control section.  
Yutan soils have hues yellower than 7.5YR in the series control section and have formed in younger loess.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage: Well
Runoff: Low or medium
Permeability: Moderate

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Deroin soils are in cropland.  Corn, soybeans, grain sorghum and winter wheat are the principle crops.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Nebraska and possibly northeastern Kansas.  The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Saunders County, Nebraska, MLRA 106, 1993.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: The zone from 7 to 40 inches.  (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)
Ochric epipedon: The zone from 0 to 7 inches.  (Ap horizons)
Argillic horizon: The zone from 7 to 40 inches.  (Bt1, Bt2 and Bt3 horizons)

ADDITIONAL DATA:  These soils are assumed to have originally classified as fine-silty, mixed, mesic Typic Argiudolls and were mapped as Geary series, eroded.  However, because of severe erosion, these soils no longer have the thick dark surface soil necessary for this classification.  In addition, the part of the soil containing the most clay is now at or near the surface.  These changes have a significant affect on the use and management of these soils. These soils are now classified as Mollic Hapludalfs.
