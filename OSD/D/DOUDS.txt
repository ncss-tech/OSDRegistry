DOUDS SERIES

The Douds series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvial sediments derived from glaciers.  These soils are on risers of high stream terraces that border valleys of major streams and their tributaries.  Slope ranges from 9 to 60 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 millimeters.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana; MLRA SSO 10-12 (Fairfield, Iowa).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Van Buren County, Iowa, 1960. 

REMARKS:  
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 36 to 86 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 36 centimeters (Ap and BE horizons); 
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 36 to 123 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3, horizons);
udic moisture regime.

These areas are distinctly higher in elevation than the modern flood plains but are lower in elevation than the adjacent late Wisconsin recent dissection slopes.

Depth to stratified material decreases as gradient increases on convex slopes.

This update relocates the type location to better represent the central concept of the Douds series.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
