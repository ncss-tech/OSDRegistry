DELUGE SERIES

The Deluge series consists of moderately deep to a hardpan, well drained soils formed in mixed alluvium on fan terraces.  Slopes range from 3 to 7 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Argidurids

TYPICAL PEDON: Deluge very gravelly sandy loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 2 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 52 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 2 inches thick)

    Bt1--2 to 8 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) very gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 45 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt2--8 to 18 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) very gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 40 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 12 inches thick)

    Btk--18 to 24 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) very gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few very fine tubular pores; 40 percent gravel; violently effervescent, few fine soft calcium carbonate masses, distinct pendants on undersides of most rock fragments; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick)

    2Bkqm--24 to 52 inches; pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) indurated silica cemented hardpan.

    3R--52 inches; conglomerate.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Whitehills (AZ) series.  Whitehills soils have unconsolidated alluvium below the duripan.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Deluge soils are on fan terraces at elevations of 2,200 to 2,700 feet.  Slopes range from 3 to 7 percent.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December and January.  The mean annual air temperature is 63 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 200 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arizo, Bluebird, Detrital, Gotchel, Hulda, Nickel and Sunstroke soils.  Arizo, Bluebird, Detrital and Nickel soils are very deep.  Gotchel soils are shallow or very shallow to a hardpan overlying bedrock.  Hulda soils are shallow or very shallow over bedrock.  Sunstroke soils are moderately deep to a hardpan overlying bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat and recreation.  Vegetation includes creosotebush, rayless goldenhead, flat top buckwheat, Joshua tree and white bursage.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Arizona.  This soil is of moderate extent.  MLRA is 30.
