DALIG SERIES

The Dalig series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess mixed with colluvium and residuum derived from basalt. Dalig soils are on hillslopes, plateaus and benches. Slopes are 2 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dalig soils are on hillslopes, plateaus and benches at elevations of 1,000 to 2,500 feet. Slopes are 2 to 65 percent. Dalig soils formed in loess mixed with colluvium and residuum derived from basalt. Summers are warm and dry, winters are cool and moist with snow cover from December through April. The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 35 inches. The average January temperature is 27 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 65 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F. The frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kaiders, Leidl, Wahoo, Yedlick, and the competing Gunn, Para and Tigit soils. Kaiders, Leidl, and Yedlick soils are loamy-skeletal. Tigit soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Wahoo soils are loamy-skeletal and are 10 to 20 inches deep to a lithic contact.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for timber production, grazeable woodland, and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is mainly Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine and Oregon white oak with an understory of creambush oceanspray, willow, western hazel, deerbrush ceanothus, common snowberry, Oregon-grape, and elk sedge.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Klickitat County, Washington; MLRA 6. The series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Klickitat County, Washington, 2003.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from the mineral surface to 15 inches 
Argillic horizon - the zone from 15 to 60 inches. The argillic horizon has less than 20 percent decrease from the maximum in clay at 60 inches. 
Particle-size control section - the zone from 17 to 37 inches
Depth to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral layer.
