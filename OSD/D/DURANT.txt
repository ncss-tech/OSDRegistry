DURANT SERIES

The Durant series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey residuum weathered from clayey deposits and shales of Cretaceous age. These nearly level to gently sloping soils occur mainly on shoulders and summits of ridges on hills in the Grand Prairie, MLRA 85. Slopes are 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 1143 mm (45 in). Mean annual temperature is 16.7 degrees C (62 degrees F).
