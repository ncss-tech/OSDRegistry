DOMINO SERIES

The Domino series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils over lime-cemented hardpans.  Domino soils are in basin areas and have slopes up to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the annual air temperature is about 63 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Xeric Petrocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Domino silt loam, cultivated.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     Ap--0 to 7 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)

     A12--7 to 14 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; common fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 11 inches thick)

     C1--14 to 22 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) heavy silt loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; common fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 15 inches thick)

     C2--22 to 27 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) light silty clay loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; common fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

     C3cam--27 to 36 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) strongly cemented caliche, thin laminae in upper part; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; extremely hard, extremely firm, violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 9 inches thick)

     C4ca--36 to 42 inches; pale yellow (5Y 8/2) heavy loam, light olive gray (5Y 6/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky  and slightly plastic; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (6 to 10 inches thick)

     C5ca--42 to 51 inches; pale yellow (5Y 8/2) weakly cemented sandy loam, light olive gray (5Y 6/2) moist; massive; extremely hard, nonsticky and nonplastic; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to 10 inches thick)

     C6--51 to 63 inches; pale yellow (5Y 8/2) loam, light olive gray (5Y 6/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Riverside County, California; about 2 miles north of Perris, California; approximately 1,650 feet east and 50 feet south of the northwest corner of sec. 20, T.3S., R.3W., S.B.B.M.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the indurated lime hardpan ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The soils are usually dry from early May to sometime in December.  They are moist in some parts of the moisture control section (4 to 12 inches depth) all the remaining time.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 59 degrees to 71 degrees F.  The control section is dominantly heavy silt loam, light silty clay loam or heavy loam.  The fine sand and coarser fraction exceeds 15 percent.  The CaCO3 equivalent in the control section is 15 to 40 percent.  The pH ranges from 8.0 to 8.8.

The A horizon is grayish brown, light brownish gray or pale brown in 10YR or 2.5Y.  It ranges from fine sandy loam to silt loam and may be saline.

The Ccam horizon contains few to many fractures that are commonly filled with carbonates.  A sequence of hard and soft horizons may be repeated.  The hardest layers do no slake in water and dry soil is not penetrated by spade.  Lower C horizons are saline and are strongly alkaline in some pedons.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bellavista, Bit, Bridge, Cave and Sunrise series.  Bellavista soils have silica-indurated hardpans and have mean annual soil temperature below 59 degrees F.  Bit soils are coarse-loamy, have more than 40 percent CaCO3 and have mean annual soil temperature below 59 degrees F.  Bridge and Sunrise soils lack indurated calcic horizons.  Cave soils lack a moisture regime bordering on Xeric.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Domino soils are on nearly level basin areas and toes of alluvial fans at elevations of 1,000 to 1,800 feet.  The climate is semiarid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches.  Average January temperature is 49 degrees F., the average July temperature is 77 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 63 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 230 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Exeter, Waukena, and Willows soils.  Exeter soils have silica-indurated hardpans and have argillic horizons.  Traver soils have argillic horizons with exchangeable sodium percentage greater than 15 percent in some part.  Waukena soils have natric horizons.  Willows soils are of fine texture throughout and crack on drying.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; slow runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Dry farmed grain and annual pasture.  Irrigated alfalfa, pasture, and salt-tolerant truck crops.  The native vegetation is saltgrass, sedges, annual grasses and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Moderately well drained; slow runoff; slow permeability.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Basin areas in Southern California.  The soils are inextensive.

REMARKS: These soils were formerly classified as Calcisols in the 1938 Yearbook. The classification was updated in February 2001 using the Eighth Edition to Soil Taxonomy. This series was formerly classified as fine-loamy, mixed, thermic, Xerollic Paleorthids. Competing series were not checked at that time.
