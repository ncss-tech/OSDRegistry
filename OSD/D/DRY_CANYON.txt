DRY CANYON SERIES

The Dry Canyon series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and residuum from red sandstone, red siltstone or conglomerate derived from these sources. Dry Canyon soils are on mountain backslopes and alluvial fans. Slopes are 5 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the: Cooley, Cupine, Jebo, Rexburg Sheep Creek, and Taylow series.
Cooley soils occur on similar landscape positions, are very deep, have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section and have Bk horizons.
Cupine soils occur on similar landscape positions and ridges and are moderately deep to bedrock.
Jebo soils occur on ridges, are moderately deep to sandstone and have Bk horizons.
Rexburg soils occur on fan terraces below Dry Canyon soils, have a coarse-silty particle-size control section and have Bk horizons.
Sheep Creek soils occur on similar landscape positions, are moderately deep to bedrock, have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section and have Bk horizons.  Taylow soils occur on ridges and shoulder slopes and are shallow to bedrock.
 
DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; high to very high surface runoff; moderately slow permeability.
 
USE AND VEGETATION: Dry Canyon soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, serviceberry, snowberry, antelope bitterbrush, eriogonum, prairie junegrass, buckwheat and twisted leaf rabbit brush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Idaho. These soils are of small extent in MLRA 43B.
