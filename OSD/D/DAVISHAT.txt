DAVISHAT SERIES

The Davishat series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in eolian sediments and slope alluvium derived from sandstone and limestone on structural benches of undulating plateaus and eolian plains. Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Haplargids 

TYPICAL PEDON: Davishat fine sandy loam, on a structural bench of a plateau, sloping 4 percent to the northwest at 310 degrees, 6,650 feet elevation--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. When described on May 8th, 2003, the soil was dry throughout.)

     Btk4--49 to 71 inches; reddish brown (2.5YR 5/4) very fine sandy loam, reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common fine tubular pores; few distinct and few faint clay films on ped faces; strongly effervescent, secondary calcium carbonate segregated as few fine irregularly shaped thin coatings on ped faces; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); clear smooth boundary.

     Btk5--71 to 87 inches; light reddish brown (2.5YR 6/4) very fine sandy loam, light red (2.5YR 6/6) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few faint clay films on ped faces; strongly effervescent, secondary calcium carbonate segregated as few fine irregularly shaped thin coatings on ped faces; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6), abrupt smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of Btk horizons is 60 to 90 inches thick.)

     R--87 to 97 inches; very strongly cemented sandstone bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION: Santa Fe County, New Mexico.  About 7.0 miles east and 2.7 miles south of Stanley, just northwest of the headquarters for Davis Hat Ranch off Anaya Rd.; USGS El Cuervo Buttes 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; Latitude 35 degrees 06 minutes 32.65 seconds North and Longitude 105 degrees 51 minutes 9.34 seconds West, NAD 27.

Soil Temperature- 52 to 54 degrees F 
Depth to base of argillic horizon - 66 to 100 inches 
Depth to calcareous material (as visible secondary calcium carbonate) - 10 to 20 inches

COMPETING SERIES: Current competitors are the Betonnie, Bijou, Gilcrest, Khapo, Neesopah, Terro, Tintero, and Vonalee series.  Betonnie and Bijou have no visible carbonates in the control section.  Bijou and Khapo have granitic parent materials.  Neesopah and Tintero have higher carbonates in the Bk horizons and should be reclassified as Calciargids. Terro soils have lithic or paralithic contacts at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Tintero and Vonalee have yellower hues in the control section.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Davishat soils are located on structural benches of undulating plateaus and eolian plains that formed from eolian material and slope alluvium derived from sandstone and limestone.  Slopes are 3 to 15 percent.  Elevation is 6,200 to 7,100 feet, mean annual temperatures range from 49 to 51 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation typically ranges from 11 to 13 inches  with the peak periods occurring from July through October and January through March. The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chupadera, Ranchos, Puertecito, and Villario soils. Chupadera soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Ranchos soils do not have an argillic horizon and occur on toeslopes of plateaus.  Puertecito soils are loamy, shallow to a lithic contact, and occur on steep, bouldery escarpments. Villario soils are loamy, shallow to shale, and occur on steep, bouldery escarpments.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; very low to low surface runoff; moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Davishat soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Present vegetation is blue grama, oneseed juniper, narrowleaf yucca, broom snakeweed, walkingstick cholla, whipple cholla, plains prickly pear, sand dropseed, and threeawn.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Davishat soils are of small extent in the northern part of the Estancia Basin in the Mexican Highland section of the Basin and Range physiographic province in north-central New Mexico, MLRA 70C.
