DOMINIC SERIES

The Dominic series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils formed in alluvium. These soils are on stream terraces and alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Entic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Dominic cobbly sandy loam in pasture (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A1--0 to 13 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) cobbly sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many very fine pores; 15 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.5); gradual smooth boundary. (10 to 15 cm thick)

    A2--13 to 28 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely cobbly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many very fine pores; 30 percent gravel and 30 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 23 cm thick)

    C1--28 to 66 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely cobbly loamy sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many fine pores; 20 percent gravel and 40 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.1); gradual wavy boundary. (13 to 51 cm thick)

    C2--66 to 152 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely cobbly sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many fine pores; 35 percent gravel and 50 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4).

Riverside (MT) - do not have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the epipedon and upper part of the subsoil  
Wabek (ND+MT SD) - have a horizon of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation; are slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline in the particle-size control section

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - stream terraces and alluvial fans
Elevation - 970 to 1,700 meters
Slope - 0 to 4 percent
Parent material - alluvium
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers
Mean annual temperature - 4 to 7 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation - 305 to 432 mm
Frost-free period is 90 to 120 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Excessively drained; moderately rapid permeability to a depth of 28 cm, rapid and very rapid below.

USE AND VEGETATION: Dominic soils are used mainly for rangeland. Some areas are in irrigated pasture and hayland. Native vegetation is basin wildrye, green needlegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, prairie sandreed, and blue grama.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Dominic soils are of small extent in intermountain valleys in western Montana. MLRA 44A and 44B.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Ravalli County (Bitterroot Valley Area), Montana, 1952.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - from the surface to 28 cm (A1 and A2 horizons)
Particle-size control section - from 25 to 100 cm (part of the A, C1, and part of the C2 horizons)

Dominic soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
