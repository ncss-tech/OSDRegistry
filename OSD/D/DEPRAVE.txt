COMPETING SERIES: This is the Kenalduma (CA) series. Kenalduma soils have a duripan with an upper boundary between 18 and 50 centimeters and average less than 18 percent clay in the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Deprave soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from granitoid and/or gneiss. Elevations range from 160 to 525 meters (525 to 1,720 feet). The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 50 to 100 millimeters (2 to 4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 23 to 26 degrees C (73.5 to 80.5 degrees F). The frost-free season is 360 to 365 days.   

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kenalduma, Rizzo, Rockhound and Roostertail series. Kenalduma, Rockhound and Roostertail soils are on similar landscape positions. Kenalduma and Roostertail soils have a duripan with an upper boundary between 18 and 50 centimeters and 100 and 150 centimeters from the soil surface, respectively. Rockhound soils have an argillic horizon and do not have a duripan. Rizzo soils are in adjacent washes, inset fans and fan aprons and have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections and no diagnostic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very low or low runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity above the argillic horizon, moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity within the argillic horizon and moderately low within the duripan.

USE AND VEGETATION: Deprave soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is mainly very sparse creosote bush and burrobush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Colorado Desert of southeastern California. MLRA 31. These soils are of small extent.
