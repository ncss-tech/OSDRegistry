DANIELVIL SERIES 

The Danielvil series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans, and outwash plains. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Danielvil loam, in rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

     A1--0 to 7 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and common medium roots; common very fine interstitial pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. 

     A2--7 to 12 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium  subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and common medium roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent cobbles, 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of A horizons is 10 to 15 inches) 

     Bw--12 to 21 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent cobbles, 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 18 inches thick) 

     C1--21 to 34 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent cobbles, 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual smooth boundary. (8 to 14 inches thick) 

     C2--34 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent cobbles, 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0).

COMPETING SERIES: 

Branham (MT) - has a lithic contact of granite at 20 to 40 inches. 

Clergen (CO) - is calcareous throughout; has hue of 5YR or redder. 

Dinnen (CO) - does not have a cambic horizon. 

Levenmile (CO) - is dry in all parts of the moisture control section 50 percent or more of the time when the soil temperature at 20 inches is above 41 degrees F. 

Redspoon (CO) - has paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. 

Sawcreek (WY) - has paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. 

Sula (MT) - has horizon with 20 to 35 percent clay below 40 inches; has slightly acid surface layer. 

Teoculli (CO) - does not have a cambic horizon; is slightly acid or moderately acid in the control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 

Landform - stream terraces, alluvial fans and outwash plains. 
Elevation - 5,800 to 6,900 feet. 
Slope - 0 to 15 percent. 
Parent material - alluvium. 
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; cool summers. 
Mean annual precipitation - 14 to 22 inches. 
Mean annual air temperature - 34 to 39 degrees F. 
Frost free season - 30 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Adel and Maurice soils. Adel soils are fine-loamy and are pachic. Maurice soils are loamy-skeletal. They are on similar landform postitions. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Danielvil soils are used mainly for rangeland and as wildlife habitat. The potential native vegetation is mainly scattered big sagebrush with Idaho fescue, Kentucky bluegrass, prairie junegrass and Richardson's needlegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Danielvil soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Deerlodge County, Montana, 1999. 

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1600.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 12 inches (A horizons); a cambic horizon from 12 to 21 inches (Bw horizon); a particle size control section from 10 to 40 inches (A2, Bw and C horizons).  Danielvil soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
