DARAS SERIES

The Daras series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and alluvium from welded tuff or rhyolite bedrock. These soils are on alluvial fans, footslopes and mountains. Slopes are 4 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy, glassy Ustivitrandic Haplocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Daras gravelly ashy sandy loam, in forest (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 0.5 inch; partially decomposed needles, twigs and leaves.

    BC--16 to 35 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) gravelly ashy coarse sandy loam, olive gray (5Y 4/2) moist, weak coarse prismatic structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots and few medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine pores; 20 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual irregular boundary (combined thickness of B horizons is 15 to 40 inches).

    C1--35 to 51 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) gravelly ashy coarse sandy loam, olive gray (5Y 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine pores; 25 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual irregular boundary.

    C2--51 to 60 inches; gray (N 6/) very gravelly ashy coarse sandy loam, olive gray (5Y 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 5 percent cobbles and 40 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.6).

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Deer Lodge County, Montana, 1999.

REMARKS: Soil interpretation record: MT1749. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: an ochric epipedon from the mineral surface to 7 inches (A and E horizons); a cambic horizon from 7 to 35 inches (Bw and BC horizons); a particle size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bw, BC and C1 horizons). Daras soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on udic.

The 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Ashy, glassy Vitrandic Eutrocryepts to Ashy, glassy Ustivitrandic Haploocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.
