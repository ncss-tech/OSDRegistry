DUNAWAY SERIES

The Dunaway series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy and gravelly alluvium. Dunaway soils occur on floodplain steps in mountain valley bottoms. Slope ranges from 1 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 in and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, carbonatic, thermic Ustic Torrifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Dunaway extremely cobbly loamy sand -- in wilderness and national park land. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) There are 50 percent gravels, 20 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones and 2 percent boulders on the surface. 

    AC--0 to 9 cm (0.0 to 3.5 in); pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely cobbly loamy sand, brown (10YR 5/3), moist; 90 percent sand; 4 percent clay;  single grain; loose, loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots and few medium roots; common medium vesicular and common very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent  stones and 25 percent  gravels and 40 percent  cobbles; strong effervescence; slightly alkaline, pH 7.7; clear smooth boundary.

    C1--9 to 87 cm (3.5 to 34.3 in); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), moist; 95 percent sand; 3 percent clay;  single grain; loose, loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots and few coarse roots; common fine medium and coarse vesicular pores; 5 percent  stones and 20 percent  cobbles and 60 percent  gravels; strong effervescence; slightly alkaline, pH 7.7; gradual wavy boundary.

    C2--87 to 200 cm (34.3 to 78.7 in); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) extremely gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), moist; 90 percent sand; 6 percent clay;  massive; very friable, soft, nonsticky, nonplastic; few fine and medium roots and common very fine roots; few fine and common medium and coarse vesicular pores; 10 percent  stones and 25 percent  cobbles and 50 percent gravels; strong effervescence; slightly alkaline, pH 7.6.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series at this time. A similar soil is the Chipotle (NM) series. Chipotle soils have mixed mineralogy and are formed in alluvium from volcanic parent materials.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dunaway soils occur floodplain steps of mountain valley bottoms at elevations of 3,400 to 5,500 feet. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. These soils formed in Holocene-age stratified sandy and gravelly alluvium derived from mostly limestone and dolomite with some other sedimentary rocks. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 17 in, mostly occurring as high intensity rain during afternoon thunderstorms from July to September;  mean annual air temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F. The frost-free period is 212 to 246 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Choza and Pinery soils. Pinery soils formed on stream terraces, often in the same drainage as Dunaway soils.  Pinery also forms on fan remnants, along with Choza soils.   Choza is shallow to a petrocalcic horizon and Pinery is very deep with a well developed mollic epipedon. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Excessively drained. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is 1 to 100 m/second.  Runoff is very low.  Flash floods of very brief duration caused by rapid runoff from rainstorms in adjacent mountains are rare to common. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat. Vegetation is characterized by the grasses: slim tridens, sideoats grama, halls panicum and little bluestem; and by the shrubs: sotol, apache plume, catclaw mimosa, mariola; and the mexican walnut tree.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: In the Guadalupe mountains region of southeastern New Mexico, MLRA 70D. The series is of moderate extent.
