DIGIT SERIES

The Digit series consists of very deep, well drained soils on alluvial terraces and in swales on valleys of mountains and dissected plateaus.  Digit soils are formed in volcanic ash overlying alluvium from basalt.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 38 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.
