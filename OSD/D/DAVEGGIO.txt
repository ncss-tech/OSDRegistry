DAVEGGIO SERIES

The Daveggio series consists of deep, well drained soils on mountain ridges.  They formed in material weathered from micaceous schist with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  Permeability is moderate.  Slope ranges from 15 to 35 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 48 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Medial over loamy, glassy over mixed, superactive Typic Fulvicryands

TYPICAL PEDON:  Daveggio medial silt loam, forest; on a northwest facing slope of 15 percent at 5,100 feet elevation.  When described on July 6, 1982, the soil was moist throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated).

(4 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw1--11 to 17 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) medial silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary.  

    Bw2--17 to 23 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) medial silt loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5)); clear wavy boundary.  (combined thickness of Bw horizons is 6 to 15 inches thick)

    2Bt1--23 to 31 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds and in pores; many very fine and fine mica flakes; 10 percent gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.5); abrupt wavy boundary.  (6 to 8 inches thick)

    2Bt2--31 to 43 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds and in pores; many very fine, fine, and common medium and coarse mica flakes; 10 percent gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.5); clear wavy boundary.  (12 to 20 inches thick)

    2C--43 to 52 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) gravelly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse mica flakes; 10 percent soft fragments of decomposed schist; 20 percent gravel; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 10 inches thick)

    2Cr--52 inches; highly weathered soft micaceous schist.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Daveggio soils are on high elevation mountain ridges.  Slopes range from 15 to 35 percent.  These soils formed in material weathered from micaceous schist with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  Elevations range from 4,800 to 5,500 feet.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F., average annual precipitation is 40 to 55 inches, and frost-free season is from 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bouldercreek, Marblecreek, Nakarna, and Vay soils.  Bouldercreek soils are on mountain slopes at lower elevations and are frigid and ashy over loamy-skeletal.  Marblecreek soils are on southerly facing mountain slopes at lower elevations and are frigid and loamy-skeletal.  Nakarna soils are on mountain slopes at lower elevations and are frigid.  Vay soils are on mountain ridgetops at high elevations and are ashy over loamy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed.  Potential natural vegetation is mainly subalpine fir, grand fir, Douglas-fir, western larch, and Engelmann spruce, with an understory of rustyleaf menziesia, big blueberry, common beargrass, wild ginger, heartleaf arnica, Pacific trillium, Oregon fairybells, myrtle pachystima, starry false Solomons-seal, piper anemone, spreading sweetroot, and queencup beadlily.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Idaho.  This soil is not extensive.  MLRA 43A.
