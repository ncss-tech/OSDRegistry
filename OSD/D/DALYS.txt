DALYS SERIES

The Dalys series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and/or residuum derived from igneous or sedimentary bedrock. These soils are on hills, mountain slopes, ridges and escaprments. Slopes are 15 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Lithic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Dalys extremely channery coarse sandy loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

   A--0 to 3 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) extremely channery coarse sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 60 percent channers and 5 percent flagstones; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick)

   C--3 to 7 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely flaggy sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 10 percent channers and 60 percent flagstones; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 7 inches thick)

   R--7 inches; fractured igneous bedrock; few fine roots in some cracks.
