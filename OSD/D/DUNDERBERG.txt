DUNDERBERG SERIES

The Dunderberg series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till derived from igneous and metamorphic rocks with additions of volcanic ash.  Dunderberg soils are on moraines.  Slopes are 8 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Vitrandic Haplocryolls

(8 to 14 inches thick)

    Bw3--39 to 60 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely gravelly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine, few fine, and few medium roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 65 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; slightly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Mono County, California; on the Toiyabe National Forest about 2.8 miles southwest of Conway Summit; approximately 1,450 feet north and 150 feet east of the southwest corner of section 33, T. 3 N., R. 25 E.; USGS Lundy 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; 38 degrees 04 minutes 25.0 seconds north latitude and 119 degrees 13 minutes 49.2 seconds west longitude, NAD27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Usually moist in the moisture control section during late fall, winter, and spring; dry from July through early October; Xeric moisture regime.

Mean annual soil temperature - 44 to 47 degrees F.

Mean summer soil temperature - 53 to 59 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Lagall and Lowland series.

Lagall soils have mean summer soil temperature of 43 to 46 degrees F., have mollic epipedons 10 to 15 inches thick, and have a udic moisture regime.  Lowland soils have mean annual soil temperature of 38 to 42 degrees F., have mollic epipedons 8 to 16 inches thick, and have an ustic moisture regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dunderberg soils are on moraines.  They typically occur on shoulder positions.  They formed in till derived from igneous and metamorphic rocks such as granodiorite, andesite, schist, and gneiss with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 8 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 8,000 to 9,500 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 45 inches, mean annual temperature is 36 to 40 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 40 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Aspetill and Conwayridge soils.  Aspetill soils have an argillic horizon.  Conwayridge soils have a frigid soil temperature regime and have mollic epipedons less than 16 inches thick.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; low surface runoff; moderately rapid permeability (high saturated hydraulic conductivity).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Dunderberg soils are used for rangeland, recreation, watershed, and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is mainly low-stature mountain big sagebrush, snowberry, western needlegrass, bluegrass, and sedge.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern California, on the east side of the Sierra Nevada Range.  These soils are not extensive with about 5,000 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 22A.
