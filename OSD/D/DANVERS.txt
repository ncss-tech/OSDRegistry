DANVERS SERIES

The Danvers series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium, or loess from mixed rock sources.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

Slope - 0 to 60 percent.

Parent material - alluvium and colluvium, or loess from mixed rock sources with high amounts of limestone.

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers.

Mean annual precipitation - 14 to 20 inches.

Mean annual air temperature - 39 to 45 degrees F.

Frost-free period - 70 to 135 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Kissick and Shaak soils.  Kissick soils occur on uplands, lack an argillic horizon, and have a lithologic discontinuity.  Shaak soils occur on alluvial fans and terraces, have an abrupt textural change above the argillic horizon, and have a lithologic discontinuity.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained. slow permeability.  Runoff is low to very high depending on slope.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Danvers soils are used mainly for dryland production of small grains, native range, and tame pasture.  Potential native vegetation is mainly western wheatgrass, blue grama, needleandthread, and prairie junegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Danvers soils are moderately extensive in central and southern Montana on high terraces and fans bordering the eastern front of the northern Rocky Mountains.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation records:  MT0089, MT0695, MT0762.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 8 inches (A1, A2 and Bt1 horizons); - calcic horizon the zone from 17 to 44 inches (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons); particle-size control section - the zone from 4 to 17 inches (Bt1, Bt2 and Btk horizons).  Danvers soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
