DALMATIAN SERIES

The Dalmatian series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Dalmatian soils are on valley floors, flood plains and low terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Cumulic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Dalmatian loam, on a southwest facing, simple, 2 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 7,420 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  Described on July 2, 1985.

(2 to 12 inches thick)

    AB--2 to 13 inches; dark grayish brown ( 10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine and few medium continuous pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 12 inches thick)

    Bw1--13 to 25 inches; dark grayish brown ( 10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine continuous pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. 

    Bw2--25 to 39 inches; dark brown ( 10YR 3/3) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; few fine roots; many very fine continuous pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.

    Bw3--39 to 45 inches; dark grayish brown ( 10YR 4/2) sandy clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; few fine roots; many very fine continuous pores; common medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) masses of iron concentrations; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.   (combined thickness of the Bw horizons is 20 to 40 inches thick)

    Bg1--45 to 49 inches; dark gray ( 10YR 4/1) sandy clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure parting moderate fine subangular blocky; hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; many very fine continuous pores; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) masses of iron concentrations; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary.  

    Bg2--49 to 60 inches: dark gray ( 10YR 4/1) gravelly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive; very hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 20 percent gravel, 10 percent cobble; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) masses of iron concentrations; neutral (pH 6.8).  (combined thickness of the Bg horizons is 4 to 16 inches)

COMPETING SERIES:  Current competitors are the Nutriosa and Straw series.  Previous competitors prior the Seventh Edition, 1996 version of Keys to Soil Taxonomy are the:  Brycan, Cordeston, Enbar, Frolic, Jodero, McGaffey, an Pineridge series.

Brycan, Cordeston, Frolic, Jodero, McGaffey, Pineridge and Straw:  do not have gleyed horizons.

Enbar:  have a lithologic discontinuity at 40 to 60 inches.

Nutriosa:  do not have a cambic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dalmatian soils.
Parent material:  alluvium derived from mixed sources.
Landform:  valley floors, flood plains and low terraces.
Slopes:  0 to 5 percent
Elevation: 7,000 to 8,500 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  41 to 45 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  15 to 20 inches.
Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year with July and August being slightly wetter and June being slightly dryer.
Frost-free period:  75 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Apmay and Schrader series.  Both are on river terraces and alluvial valley floors.

Apmay soils have substrata of extremely gravelly sand or extremely gravelly loamy sand within a depth of 40 inches and are somewhat poorly drained.

Schrader soils are poorly drained and have 5 to 18 percent clay in the particle size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained,  low runoff, moderate permeability.  These soils are rarely flooded for short periods during the months of May and June.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, hay production, and recreation.  Native vegetation consists of western wheatgrass, tufted hairgrass, sedge, mountain brome, iris, and cottonwood trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Colorado.  LRR E, MLRA 48A.  This series is of small extent.
