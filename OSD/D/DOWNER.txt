MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Gloucester County, New Jersey, 1960

REMARKS:
02/2002. This revision modifies the range of gravel content to restrict layers to less than 25 percent rock fragments and revise the competing Swainton series to layers with more than 25 percent rock fragments. Other revisions to expand the color and textural RIC required for MLRA update projects in NJ, MD, and DE.

09/2011. Revisions to formatting and data consistency with NASIS were made.

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this 
pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 25 centimeters (10 inches) (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone of 46 to 76 centimeters (18 to 30 inches) (Bt horizon)

ADDITIONAL DATA: Several pedons are available from the National Soil Survey 
Center, Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln NE.
