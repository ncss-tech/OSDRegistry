DENHAWKEN SERIES

The Denhawken series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in clayey material weathered from shale. These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on hillslopes on inland dissected coastal plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 885 mm (35 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F).

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 152 to 203 cm (60 to 80 in). When dry, these soils have cracks up to 5 cm (2 in) wide at the surface and extending to depths of more than 127 cm (50 in). Wedge-shaped aggregates and/or slickensides range from few to common. Linear extensibility exceeds 6.0 cm within 100 cm (40 in) of the surface. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout.

Soil Moisture: An ustic soil moisture regime.  The soil moisture control section remains dry in some or all parts for 90 or more but less than 180 cumulative days in normal years.  Precipitation falls mostly during the months of April through June and October through November.  July through September and January through March are the driest months.  


Mean annual soil temperature: 22 to 24 degrees C (72 To 75 degrees F).
Depth to secondary calcium carbonate: 30 to 137 cm (16 to 54 in).

COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Kincheloe (TX) series. Similar soils are the Chargo (TX), Mangum (TX), Throck (TX), Tilvern (TX), and Tussy (OK) series. 
Kincheloe soils: have sola less than 102 cm (40 in) thick. 
Chargo soils: are saline in the upper part and have strata of contrasting textures at depths of (102 to 203 cm (40 to 80 in). 
Mangum, Throck, and Tilvern soils: have a thermic temperature regime, and mixed mineralogy.
Tussy soils: have a thermic temperature regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: Calcareous clayey marine shale 
Landform: microhighs in complex soils areas. In native areas where the slopes are less than one percent, this soil occurs as mounds 5 to 20 cm (2 to 8 in) higher than the adjoining depressions. When the slopes are 1 to 5 percent, this soil occurs as ridges perpendicular to the slope 
contours.
Slope: 0 to 5 percent
Mean annual air temperature range: 21 to 23 degrees C (70 to 73 degrees F).
Mean annual precipitation range: 652 to 918 mm (26 to 36 in)
Precipitation Pattern: Precipitation falls mostly during the months of April through June and October through November.  July through September and January through March are the driest months.
Frost-free period: 270 to 290 days
Elevation: 46 to 229 m (150 to 750 ft)
Thornthwaite annual P-E indices: 40 to 50

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Clareville, Coy, Elmendorf, Laparita, Marcelinas, and Monteola series.
Clareville and Laparita soils: occur at lower elevations.
Coy, Denhawken, Marcelinas, and Monteola soils: occur on similar surfaces.  
Elmendorf soils: have a mollic epipedon and usually occur on microlows in a complex with Denhawken soils.
Monteola soils: are clayey throughout and have intersecting slickensides.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: well drained.  Permeability is very slow.  Runoff is slow on 0 to 1 percent slopes, medium on 1 to 3 percent slopes, and high on 3 to 5 percent slopes.  
 
USE AND VEGETATION: Used for crop production and livestock grazing.  Main crops are grain sorghum, cotton, corn, and small grains. Livestock grazing areas are mostly improved bermudagrass.  Native vegetation consists of mainly mesquite, cacti, live oak, little bluestem, tricloris, sideoats grama, lovegrass, Arizona cottontop, and vine-mesquite.
