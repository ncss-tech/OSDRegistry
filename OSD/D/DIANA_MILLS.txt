MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Cumberland County, Virginia, 2005.

REMARKS: Diana Mills soils were previously included with Mecklenburg soils. The creation of a mesic region within the southern Piedmont and the occurrence of the deep to soft bedrock component necessitated a new series be established.  
Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 5 inches (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 10 to 42 inches (Bt horizon)
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Typical pedon sampled and analyzed at VPI&SU as 00VA-029-003 (reference data) and at the NSSL as S01VA-029-003 (characterization data).
