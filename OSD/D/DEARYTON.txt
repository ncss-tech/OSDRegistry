DEARYTON SERIES

The Dearyton series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on foothills and uplands.  They formed in material weathered from saprolitic gneiss, quartzite, sedimentary lithologies of the Latah formation, and glacial till, mixed with loess and volcanic ash in the upper part.  Slopes are 0 to 40 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.  The Hodgson series has a similar classification except for mixed mineralogy and has secondary carbonates at a depth of 14 to 26 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dearyton soils are on foothills and uplands at elevations of 1900 to 3000 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 40 percent. These soils formed in material weathered from saprolitic gneiss, quartzite, and Latah formation and glacial till, mixed with loess and volcanic ash in the upper part.  The climate is characterized by warm, relatively dry summers and cool, moist winters. The average annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches.  The average annual air temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F.  The frost free season is 100 to 135 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kramerhill, Freeman, Glenrose, and Skalan soils. Kramerhill soils are on foothills, fine-loamy and are deep to a paralithic contact.  Freeman soils are on loess uplands and are fine-silty.  Glenrose soils are on loess uplands and foothills, are fine-loamy, and have mollic epipedons.  Skalan soils are on foothills, are loamy skeletal, and are moderately deep to a lithic contact. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained; slow to rapid runoff; slow permeability. There is a perched water table at a depth of 6 to 24 inches from January to April.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, small grains, hay and pasture, and grass seed production. Potential natural vegetation is ponderosa pine and occasional scattered Douglas-fir with an understory of common snowberry, woods rose, white spiraea, Saskatoon serviceberry, pinegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, wild strawberry, kinnikinnick, and silky lupine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern Washington; MLRA 43 and 44. Dearyton soils are of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Spokane County, Washington, 1964. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 12 inches (Oi, A, and BE horizons)

Argillic horizon - the zone from 12 to 60 inches (2Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3, 2Bt4, and 2Bt5)

Vitrandic feature - the zone from 1 to 12 inches (A and BE horizons)

Ultic feature - the zone from 12 to 32 inches having base saturation by sum of cations of less than 75 percent in one or more horizon

Particle-size control section - the zone from 12 to 32 inches (2Bt1, 2Bt2 and part of the 2Bt3 horizons) 

The discontinuity in the 2Bt1 horizon represents the where the influence of the saprolitic gneiss, quartzite, Latah formation, and glacial till influence the soil morphology.

Dearyton soils are also mapped in Stevens County, WA, and will need to be further investigated for soil temperature regime as reflected by the local vegetation.  The Stevens County modal pedon describes Douglas-fir, western larch, lodgepole pine and grand fir in the potential native vegetation which indicates a frigid soil temperature regime.

Dearyton soils should be further investigated to determine typical mineralogy (isotic vs. mixed).
