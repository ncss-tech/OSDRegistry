DOGPAWS SERIES

The Dogpaws series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from basalt. Dogpaws soils are on weathered lava plains and alluvial fans have slopes of 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Calcidic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Dogpaws clay loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     A--0 to 3 inches (0 to 7 cm); brown (7.5YR 5/2) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2), moist; 24 percent clay; weak thick platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; many very fine roots throughout and many fine roots throughout; common very fine tubular and common fine tubular pores; 5 percent, nonflat, subangular, indurated unspecified fragments gravels; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline, pH 7.8; clear smooth boundary.

     BA--3 to 9 inches (7 to 23 cm); brown (7.5YR 5/3) loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3), moist; 26 percent clay; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; many very fine roots throughout and many fine roots throughout; common very fine tubular and common fine tubular pores; 2 percent faint clay films on all faces of peds; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline, pH 8.0; gradual smooth boundary.

     Btk--9 to 14.5 inches (23 to 37 cm); pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) clay loam, pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2), moist; 31 percent clay; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, very sticky, very plastic; few very fine roots throughout; few coarse tubular pores; 20 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 80 percent carbonate, finely disseminated throughout; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline, pH 8.4; gradual smooth boundary.

     Bkk1--14.5 to 39.5 inches (37 to 100 cm); pale pinkish white (7.5YR 9/2) clay loam, pink (7.5YR 7/3), moist; 30 percent clay; massive; hard, firm, very sticky, very plastic; 100 percent carbonate, finely disseminated throughout; 5 percent, nonflat, subangular, indurated unspecified fragments gravels; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline, pH 8.8; diffuse smooth boundary.

     Bkk2--39.5 to 59 inches (100 to 150 cm); pale pinkish white (7.5YR 9/2) clay loam, pink (7.5YR 7/3), moist; 30 percent clay; massive; moderately hard, firm, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; 100 percent carbonate, finely disseminated throughout; 10 percent, nonflat, subangular, indurated unspecified fragments gravels; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline, pH 8.4.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dogpaws soils are at elevations of 5,900 to 6,800 feet on hills. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. The soils formed in slope alluvium derived from basalt and pyroclastics including tuff, ash, cinders, and volcanic bombs. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 49 to 54 degrees F. The average annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 18 inches and occurs as thunderstorms in July, August and September and as rain and snow in the winter. The frost-free period ranges from 130 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ashfork, Cross, Wilaha, and Ziegler soils. Ashfork soils are moderately deep and mollic. Cross soils are less than 20 inches deep to a lithic contact. Wilaha soils are shallow over cinders.  Ziegler soils are moderately deep over cinders.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to medium runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used primarily for livestock grazing. Vegetation is mainly blue grama, woolly fescue, alkali sacaton, green rabbitbrush, broom snakeweed, one-seed juniper and pinyon pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Arizona. The soils are moderately extensive. MLRA is 39.
