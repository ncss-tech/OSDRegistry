DEAVER SERIES

The Deaver series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from shale.  Deaver soils are on hills and ridges.  Slopes range from 3 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, smectitic, calcareous, mesic Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Deaver loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    A--0 to 4 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; moderate thin platy structure parting to strong fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)

    Bk--4 to 24 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) clay, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; massive; extremely hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine round soft masses of calcium carbonate; few shale pararock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary.  (17 to 37 inches thick)

    Cr--24 inches; partially weathered shale.

TYPE LOCATION:  Park County, Wyoming; located about 1,300 feet south and 300 feet east of the northwest corner of sec. 10, T. 55 N., R. 99 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture:  Aridic moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature:  48 to 50 degrees F
Mean annual summer soil temperature:  62 to 68 degrees F
Depth to paralithic contact:  20 to 40 inches to soft shale
Depth to secondary calcium carbonate:  0 to 10 inches
Particle-size control section (weighted average):  
  Clay content:  35 to 50 percent
  Fine or coarser sand content:  10 to 50 percent
  Rock fragments or pararock fragments:  0 to 15 percent 
  Visible accumulations of calcium carbonate and or gypsum
  occur in some pedons.

A horizon:
Hue:  10YR to 5Y
Value:  5 to 8 dry, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma:  2 to 4
Rock fragments:  0 to 30 percent gravel
Pararock fragments:  0 to 15 percent
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  0 to 10 percent

Bk or C horizon:
Hue:  10YR to 5Y
Value:  5 to 8 dry, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma:  2 to 4
Texture:  SIC, C
Clay content:  35 to 50 percent
Rock fragments:  0 to 15 percent
Pararock fragments:  0 to 15 percent
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  1 to 15 percent

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Barnmot, Benin, Ragtown, and Stutzman series.   
Barnmot, Benin, Ragtown, and Stutzman: very deep

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  residuum derived from shale
Landform:  hills and ridges
Slopes:  3 to 45 percent
Elevation:  3,800 to 6,100 feet
Mean annual temperature:  45 to 52 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation:  5 to 9 inches
Precipitation pattern:  precipitation is relatively evenly distributed throughout the year
Frost-free period:  90 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bributte, Chipeta, Greybull, and Persayo series and the competing Stutzman series.  The Bributte, Chipeta, and Persayo soils have a paralithic contact at depths less than 20 inches.  The Greybull soils have less than 35 percent clay in the control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  well drained, medium to very high runoff, slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for irrigated cropland, rangeland, and wildlife habitat.  Potential vegetation consists of birdfoot sage, Gardner saltbush, cactus, and western wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Wyoming and northwestern Colorado. LRR D, MLRA 32 and 34; This series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Park county, Wyoming, 1972.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 4 inches.  (A horizon)
Paralithic contact:  The contact with soft shale at 24 inches.  (C and Cr horizons)
Where Bk horizons occur there is no evidence of carbonate removal in the overlying horizon; therefore it is not cambic.
