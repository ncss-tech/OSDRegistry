DUTCHJOHN SERIES

The Dutchjohn series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and volcanic ash over colluvium and residuum derived from tuff. The Dutchjohn soils are on plateaus and rock pediments. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dutchjohn soils are on plateaus and rock pediments.  These soils formed in loess and volcanic ash over colluvium and residuum derived from tuff.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Elevations are 6,000 to 6,500 feet. The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Anawalt, Igdell and Ninemile soils. Anawalt and Ninemile soils have fine textured control sections and are less than 50 cm to bedrock. Igdell soils have a fine textured control section and a duripan above 100 cm.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat. Basin big sagebrush, Idaho fescue, basin wildrye, big squirreltail, Sandberg bluegrass, rabbitbrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Nevada. MLRA 25. These soils are not extensive.
