DERBY SERIES

The Derby series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy eolian sediments of Pleistocene age.  These are reworked dunes on stream terraces along major streams in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A), and Northern Cross Timbers (MLRA 84A).  Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 914 mm (36 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, thermic Lamellic Ustipsamments

TYPICAL PEDON: Derby loamy fine sand-savannah, at an elevation of 256 m (840 ft).  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Depth to lamellae: 112 to 152 cm (44 to 60 in)  
Other features: Ap or A1 horizons that are fine sandy loam cannot be deeper than 25 cm (10 in) or the depth of the Ap horizon, whichever is deeper.

Ap or A horizons: 
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 4 to 7 dry, 3 or 5 moist
Chroma: 2 to 6 dry or moist
Texture: loamy fine sand or fine sandy loam
Effervescence: none
Reaction: moderately acid to slightly alkaline

E and Bt horizons:
E Part
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 6 to 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist
Chroma: 4 to 8 dry or moist
Texture: fine sand or loamy fine sand
Effervescence: none
Reaction: moderately acid to moderately alkaline 

Bt Part
Hue: 2.5YR or 5YR
Value: 6 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 4 to 8 dry or moist
Texture: loamy fine sand, fine sand and fine sandy loam
Lamellae: range from thin bands in the Bt1 part to the thickest in the Bt2 part, and become thin again with depth  
Lamellae thickness ranges: from 1 to 25 mm (0.1 to 2 in), but those more than 1 cm thick do not reach a cumulative total of 15 cm within a depth of 152 cm (60 in) in any pedon, lamellae are usually 2 to 20 cm (0.7 to 8 in) apart  
Effervescence: none
Reaction: moderately acid to moderately alkaline

C horizon (where present): 
Hue: 7.5YR
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist
Chroma: 6 or 8 dry or moist
Bedding planes: eolian origin are evident and cross bedding is common  
Other features: in some pedons, the C horizon is not present and the lamellae zone rests on older buried terrace sediments; these older buried terrace sediments are redder, loamy, and consist of thicker lamellae or continuous subsoil material

COMPETING SERIES:  The Eda soils are the only series in the same family.  Soils in similar families are the Aline, Aquilla, Dillwyn, Eufaula, Goltry, and Goodnight series.  
Aline, Aquilla, Eufaula and Goltry soils: have lamellae that total more than 15 cm (6 in) thick; in addition, Aquilla and Eufaula soils have siliceous mineralogy  
Eda soils: are dry for longer periods
Dillwyn soils: have an apparent water table at depths of 0.3 to 1 m (1 to 3 ft)
Goodnight soils: do not have lamellae

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: sandy eolian sediments of Pleistocene age
Landscape: dune fields
Landform: nearly level to steep uplands, on the first terrace above the flood plain on the north side of major rivers

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Goodnight series and Amber, Gaddy, Minco, Paluxy (MLRA 85 and 84C), and Yahola series. 
Amber soils: have a coarse-silty control section and occur on flood plains  
Gaddy soils: are stratified, have an irregular decrease in organic matter, and occur on flood plains 
Goodnight soils: do not have lamellae, and occur on similar landscapes 
Minco soils: have a mollic epipedon, a coarse-silty control section, and occur farther from the sediment source  
Paluxy soils: have a coarse-loamy control section and occur on similar landscapes  
Yahola soils: have a coarse-loamy control section, an irregular decrease in organic matter, and occur on flood plains

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage: somewhat excessively drained 
Runoff: negligible on 0 to 5 percent slopes, very low on 5 to 20 percent slopes, and low on slopes greater than 20 percent
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: high

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for livestock grazing.  The more gentle slopes are cultivated to small grains or improved pasture.  Native vegetation is savannah with an understory of tall grasses.  Principle trees are post oak, blackjack oak, American elm, black walnut, chittamwood, and eastern red cedar.  Principle grasses are little bluestem, purple top, paspalum, switchgrass, and sand dropseed.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Payne County, Oklahoma 1983, by J.E. Henley

REMARKS:  
These soils were formerly on the inactive list.  They are included in the Derby and Eufaula series in some older published surveys.

Updated competing series, taxonomic version, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and formatting. (JLD 01/2016) Added MLRA 80A to OSD 07/2017.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 51 cm (0 to 20 in) (A1 and A2 horizons)
Albic horizon: 51 to 137 cm (20 to 54 in) (E1 horizon)  
Lamellae: 137 to 253 cm (54 to 120 in) (E2 and Bt1, E3 and Bt2 horizons)

Edited 03/2018 (JAD-JLD) Updated pedon description, and other sections.
