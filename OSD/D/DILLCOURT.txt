SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Klickitat County, Washington; 2003

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon
*Mollic epipedon--zone from the surface to a depth of 56 cm
*Argillic horizon--zone from 56 to 150 cm
*Estimated base saturation (by sum)--more than 75 percent in upper 75 cm

Further study is needed to differentiate the Dillcourt series from the Oreoke series, which is in a transitional zone between areas of rangeland and forestland. The Oreoke series is correlated to the Oregon white oak/antelope bitterbrush/Idaho fescue plant community.
