DOESPRING SERIES

The Doespring series consists of shallow to a cemented pan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone. The Doespring soils are on backslopes of rock pediments. Slope ranges from 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 360 millimeters (14 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C. (45 degrees F.).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, mesic, shallow Petrocalcic Calciustolls

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Leecanyon, Penalto and Penasco series. Leecanyon soils do not have bedrock within 150 centimeters (60 inches). Penalto and Penasco soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 13 to 15 degrees C. (55 to 59 degrees F.), indurated pans and do not have bedrock within 150 centimeters (60 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Doespring soils are on backslopes of rock pediments. Slope ranges from 15 to 50 percent. These soils formed in alluvium derived from limestone. Elevation is 2,015 to 2,535 meters (6,600 to 8,300 feet). The climate is sub-humid continental, cool, with moist winters and occasional summer thundershowers. Mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 millimeters (12 to 16 inches). The mean annual temperature is 6 to 9 degrees C. (43 to 48 degrees F.) and the frost-free period is 90 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Buckspring, Seralin and Purob soils. The Buckspring and Purob soils are very gravelly loams, Seralin soils are extremely gravelly loams. Buckspring and Seralin soils occur on mountainsides and are shallow to bedrock. Purob soils occur on fan remnants at lower elevations with blackbrush vegetation.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very high runoff; moderate permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity over very slow permeability in the cemented pan.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for forest and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly singleleaf pinyon, Utah juniper, curlleaf mountain mahogany, black sagebrush, desert ceanothus and muttongrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southern Nevada; MLRA 30. These soils are not extensive.
