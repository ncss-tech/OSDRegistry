DOGIECREEK SERIES

The Dogiecreek series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in alluvium.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid Typic Fluvaquents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Dogiecreek fine sandy loam - on a slope of 1 percent.  When described, the soil was moist to 60 inches.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) fine sandy loam, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) dry; weak thin platy structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable; common fine roots; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 4 inches thick.)

    Cz--3 to 6 inches; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2), very fine sandy loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) dry; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, few fine compressed roots; few fine accumulations of salts; slight effervescence; strongly alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

    Czg1--6 to 12 inches; olive gray (5Y 4/2) loam, light olive gray (5Y 6/2) dry; common fine distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine compressed roots; finely stratified material of light gray (2.5Y 6/1) dry; common fine nests of salts; strong effervescence; very strongly alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

    Czg2--12 to 20 inches; olive gray (5Y 4/2) fine sandy loam, light olive gray (5Y 6/2) dry; common fine distinct light yellowish brown (2.5Y 5/6) mottles; massive; soft, very friable; very few fine roots; finely stratified with material of light gray (2.5Y 6/1) dry; common fine nests of salts; slight effervescence; very strongly alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

    Czg3--20 to 41 inches; olive gray (5Y 5/2) fine sandy loam, light gray (5Y 7/2) dry; common fine distinct light yellowish brown (2.5Y 5/6) mottles; massive; soft, very friable; few fine accumulations of carbonates; few fine nests of salts; strong effervescence; very strongly alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

    Cg--41 to 60 inches; olive gray (5Y 5/2) loamy fine sand, light olive gray (5Y 6/2) dry; common medium distinct light yellowish brown (2.5Y 5/6) mottles; loose; slight effervescence; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Harding County, South Dakota, 10 miles east and 1 mile south of Buffalo; 1,050 feet west and 185 feet south of the northeast corner of sec. 26, T. 19 N., R. 5 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERTISTICS:  The depth of carbonates ranges from 0 to 9 inches.  The control section contains 1 to 2 percent salts high in sodium.  The control section contains 10 to 18 percent clay.  The EC ranges from 8 to 30 mmhos.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 5 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or loam and ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.

The C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6, 5 to 7 dry; and chroma of 1 to 2.  It is stratified with layers of loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam and silt loam and it typically grades to loamy fine sand or fine sand below depths of 35 to 60 inches.  It ranges from moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING.  The Dogiecreek soils are nearly level on flood plains and swales with a shallow channel.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The soil formed in loamy alluvium.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 16 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Glendive, Hanly, Havre, and Korchea soils.  These soils are on similar landscapes.  All of these soils do not have the high concentration of salts.  In addition, Hanly soils have a sandy control section and Havre and Korchea have a fine-loamy control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained.  Runoff is low. Permeability is moderate.  The soil is occasionally or frequently flooded.  The watertable is 0 to 3 feet.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland.  The native vegetation is inland saltgrass, alkali saction, cordgrass, and wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern South Dakota and possible in southwestern North Dakota and eastern Montana.
