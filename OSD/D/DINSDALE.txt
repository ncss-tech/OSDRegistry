DINSDALE SERIES

The Dinsdale series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in 50 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) of loess and the underlying glacial till. Dinsdale soils are on interfluves, ridges and side slopes on dissected till plains. Slopes range from 0 to 14 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (49 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 910 millimeters (36 inches).

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Iowa County, Iowa, 1965.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 48 to 98 centimeters (19 to 39 inches) (Bt1, Bt2 and 2Bt3 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (0 to 60 inches) (Ap, A, Ab, Bt1, Bt2, 2Bt3, 2BC1 and 2BC2 horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 48 centimeters (0 to 19 inches) (Ap, A, and AB horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 48 to 117 centimeters (19 to 46 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, and 2Bt3 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Not all pedons have 1.2 times more clay increase to meet the requirements of an argillic horizon. Eroded surface horizons of some pedons typically do not meet the requirements for Mollisols. Further investigation is needed to determine the extensiveness of these properties.

Some pedons have vertical seams or wedges of sand or loamy sand about 5 to 15 centimeters (2 to 6 inches) wide and about 0.9 to 1.2 meters (3 to 4 feet) deep extending downward from the stone line into the glacial till.

Cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data (KSSL).
