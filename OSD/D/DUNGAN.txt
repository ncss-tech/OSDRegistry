DUNGAN SERIES

The Dungan series consists of very deep, well drained soils on high floodplain steps, alluvial fans, and fan remnants of alluvial plains. These soils formed in mixed alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1015 millimeters. Mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Fluventic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Dungan silt loam on a 1 percent slope under pasture grasses and clover at an elevation of 7 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated. When described on December 7, 1988 the soil was moist throughout.)

(15 to 64 centimeters inches thick)

	C2--94 to 155 centimeters; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) silty clay loam; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, very sticky, very plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5). (15 to 114 centimeters thick)

TYPE LOCATION: Humboldt County, California; about 2.4 kilometers northeast of Ferndale, California, 225 meters west of Fulmor Road on Bertleson/Pedrotti Road, 50 meters south; 230 meters east and 760 meters north of the southwest corner Section 36, T.3N., R.2W. HB&M; Ferndale Quadrangle (7.5 minutes series); WGS84 Decimal degrees 40.5988889 latitude, -124.2522222 longitude, UTM Zone 10 394054mE, 4494971mN; NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil Moisture: The soil moisture control section (15 to 43 centimeters) is not dry in all parts for as long as 90 cumulative days in normal years. The soils have a udic moisture regime.

Depth to redoximorphic features: greater than 100 centimeters

Soil Temperature: The mean annual soil temperature at 50 centimeters is 12 to 15 degrees C. The average summer soil temperature is about 18 degrees C and the average winter soil temperature is about 9 degrees C. The difference between average summer and winter soil temperatures is about 6 to 9 degrees C.

Particle-size control section (weighted average): 
Clay content: 18 to 27 percent.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Armiesburg, Battleground, Bismarckgrove, Dozaville, and Omadi series. These soils have a difference between average winter and summer soil temperature of more than 9 degrees C and have a mean January soil temperature below 8 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Dungan soils are on high floodplain steps, alluvial fans, and fan remnants of alluvial plains near the Pacific Ocean. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in mixed alluvium. Elevation is 3 to 50 meters. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, rainy winters. Mean annual precipitation is 890 to 2030 millimeters. The mean January temperature is about 8 degrees C. The mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C. The mean annual air temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C. Frost free season is about 275 to 330 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Arlynda, Ferndale, Russ, and Weott soils. Arlynda soils are on meander scars and depressions and have redoximorphic features at 0 to 10 centimeters.  Ferndale, Russ, and Weott soils lack a mollic epipedon. Ferndale soils have redoximorphic features at a depth greater than 100 centimeters, and are on high flood-plain steps. Russ soils are on natural levees, have redoximorphic features at a depth greater than 100 centimeters, and are coarse-loamy. Weott soils are fine-silty, on low flood-plain steps, and have redoximorphic features at 0 to 10 centimeters.  

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; low runoff; moderately slow permeability, moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. The soils are rarely flooded for brief periods December through February.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for pasture, hay, and occasionally truck garden produce. Nearly all areas of this soil have had the native vegetation removed.  The native vegetation is estimated to be a variable canopy of red alder, Sitka spruce, and black cottonwood with scattered willow and redwood, with an understory of blackberry, ferns, and grasses.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: California Coastal Redwood Belt and southern Oregon; MLRA 4.  The series is not extensive.
