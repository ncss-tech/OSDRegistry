DELHEW SERIES

The Delhew series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from granitic rocks.  Delhew soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 600 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Pachic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Delhew very gravelly loamy coarse sand--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is covered with about 1 percent stones, 1 percent cobbles, and 50 percent gravel.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Angelwhine, Aspetill, Badwater, Bickmore, Blackbear, Bluebell, Booneville, Buena Vista, Dab, Dailybasin, Hawkinspeak, Igor, Keman, Littlemud, Lostcannon, Monibasin, Parkalley, Parkay, Redbird, Rutherford, Sweetmount, and Woodhurst series.

Angelwhine soils have 18 to 25 percent clay, are dominated by medium and coarse gravel (5 to 75 mm diameter) in the particle-size control section, and have rock fragments that are volcanic rocks.  Aspetill soils have 18 to 25 percent clay and are dominated by cobbles in the particle-size control section.  Badwater soils have 25 to 35 percent clay and are dominated by boulders in the particle-size control section.  Bickmore, Blackbear, Bluebell, Buena Vista, Hawkinspeak, Littlemud, Rutherford, and Woodhurst soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Booneville soils have mean annual soil temperature of 2 to 4 degrees C.  Dab soils are dominated by medium and coarse gravel of volcanic lithology in the particle-size control section.  Dailybasin and Igor soils have an ustic moisture regime.  Keman soils have mean annual soil temperature of 4 to 6 degrees C.  Lostcannon soils have the base of the argillic horizon below 100 cmfrom the soil surface.  Monibasin soils have 18 to 25 percent clay, are dominated by stones in the particle-size control section, and have rock fragments that are volcanic rocks.  Parkalley soils are dominated by flagstones and average 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Parkay soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Redbird soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates within 100 cm of the soil surface.  Sweetmount soils are deep to paralithic contacts and have subhorizons of the argillic horizon with 27 to 50 percent clay.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Delhew soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in colluvium derived from granitic rocks.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 2,378 to 3,048 meters.  The climate is subhumid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 760 mm, mean annual temperature is 2 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 30 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bakscratch and Bullville soils.  Bakscratch soils are shallow to paralithic contacts and have mollic epipedons that are 18 to 36 cm thick.  Bullville soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts and have mollic epipedons that are 25 to 38 cm thick.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium surface runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Delhew soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, snowberry, spike fescue,Western needlegrass, Letterman's needlegrass, and mountain brome. This pedon is correlated to R022AY052NV, Gravelly Slope 16+ P.Z.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada and eastern California.  These soils are not extensive with about 4,300 acres of the series mapped to date.  The series concept is in MLRA 26, while other acreage occurs in MLRA 22A.
