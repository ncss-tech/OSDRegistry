DANBURY SERIES

The Danbury series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains and upland drainageways.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 850 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, nonacid, mesic Oxyaquic Udifluvents
