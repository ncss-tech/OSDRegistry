DASHIKI SERIES

The Dashiki series consists of very deep and well drained soils on undulating to rolling areas of volcanic plateaus and formed in a mantel of local alluvium derived from tephra and loess over tephra. Slopes are 2 to 12 percent. Dashiki soils have moderately rapid permeability in the upper part and very rapid permeability in the lower part. The mean annual precipitation is about 1300 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 1 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy, glassy Typic Vitricryands

TYPICAL PEDON: Dashiki silt loam, supporting a lodgepole pine/grouse whortleberry plant community type, woodland; on a slope of 4 percent with a north aspect at 2375 meters elevation. (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to moderate runoff; moderately rapid permeability in the upper part and very rapid permeability in the lower part.

USE AND VEGETATION: Dashiki soils are used for recreation, woodland and wildlife habitat. These soils commonly support a lodgepole pine/grouse whortleberry community type. Recent clearcut areas of these soils support communities dominated by elk sedge. The potential native vegetation is a subalpine fir/grouse whortleberry plant association, grouse whortleberry phase.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Dashiki soils are moderately extensive in southeastern Idaho and northwestern Wyoming; MLRA 43B
