DASHIKI SERIES

The Dashiki series consists of very deep and well drained soils on volcanic plateaus. Slopes are 2 to 12 percent. These soils formed in a mantel of local alluvium derived from tephra and loess over tephra. Dashiki soils have moderately rapid permeability in the upper part and very rapid permeability in the lower part. The average annual precipitation is about 50 inches. Average annual air temperature is about 34 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Belrick, Linksterly and Millerpoint series. Belrick soils have 75 to 85 percent volcanic glass and 70 to 90 percent phosphate retention in the zone of andic soil properties. Linksterly soils have umbric epipedons and lack cambic horizons. Millerpoint soils have less than 30 percent volcanic glass and bulk density of .65 to .85 g/cc.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Dashiki soils are on volcanic plateaus. Slopes are undulating to rolling and range from 2 to 12 percent. The soil formed in a thick mantle of local alluvium derived from tephra and loess over tephra. The rock fragments and size component and rock fragments are dominantly obsidian. Elevations range from 7,200 to 8,300 feet. The average annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 65 inches. Mean annual air temperature is 32 to 37 degrees F. Frost may occur at anytime throughout the year.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the proposed Lasac and Oleo series. Lasac soils occur on knolls intermixed with the Dashiki soils and on adjacent plateau escarpments. They are less than 20 inches deep over substratum layers of tephra. Oleo soils occur on adjacent plateaus and have umbric epipedons and argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to moderate runoff; moderately rapid permeability in the upper part and very rapid permeability in the lower part.

USE AND VEGETATION: Dashiki soils are used for recreation, woodland and wildlife habitat. These soils commonly support a lodgepole pine/grouse whortleberry community type. Recent clearcut areas of these soils support communities dominated by elk sedge. The potential native vegetation is a subalpine fir/grouse whortleberry plant association, grouse whortleberry phase.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Idaho and northwestern Wyoming. The soil is of moderate extent.
