DAMCREEK SERIES

The Damcreek series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium in drainageways. Slopes range from 4 to 16 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 820 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 0.4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, isotic, nonacid Fluvaquentic Cryaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Damcreek stratified highly organic silt, located in a drainageway on a plain with a slope of 14 percent and elevation of 38 meters; when described on July 13th, 2011 the soil was wet from 0 to 60 cm (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted)

 Oi--0 to 7 centimeters; slightly decomposed plant material; nonsticky, nonplastic; many fine roots and common medium roots and many very fine roots; moderately acid, pH 5.8; clear smooth boundary 

 Oa--7 to 18 centimeters; highly decomposed plant material; nonsticky, nonplastic; many fine roots and common medium roots and many very fine roots; moderately acid, pH 5.9; clear smooth boundary

 A1--18 to 40 centimeters; very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) stratified highly organic silt; 13 percent sand; 80 percent silt; 7 percent clay; weak medium granular structure; very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; many fine roots and many very fine roots; slightly acid, pH 6.1; clear wavy boundary

 2A2--40 to 60 centimeters; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) gravelly silt loam; 30 percent sand; 63 percent silt; 7 percent clay; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine roots; 1 percent nonflat 2 to 5 millimeter fragments and 14 percent nonflat 5 to 75 millimeter fragments; moderately acid, pH 5.9; abrupt smooth boundary

 2Cg--60 to 183 centimeters; dark greenish gray (5GY 4/1) loam; 45 percent sand; 37 percent silt; 18 percent clay; massive structure; firm, slightly sticky, moderately plastic; 1 percent nonflat 2 to 5 millimeter fragments and 9 percent nonflat 5 to 75 millimeter fragments; slightly acid, pH 6.1
