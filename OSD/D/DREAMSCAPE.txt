DREAMSCAPE SERIES

The Dreamscape series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from sandstone.  The Dreamscape soils are on mountain summits and side slopes.  Slopes range from 3 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Pachic Argicryolls
