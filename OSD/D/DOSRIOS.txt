DOSRIOS SERIES

The Dosrios series consist of soils that are very deep to mudstone, well drained, very slowly permeable soils, that formed in moderately saline clayey marine sediments overlying clayey residuum derived from mudstone of Tertiary age. These soils are on summits and shoulders of interfluves. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 544 mm (22 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (72 degrees F).

Esseville soils: have a gypsic horizon within 100 cm (40 in) of the surface; are moderately-deep to densic material; are on a similar landscape position.
Fashing soils: are shallow to densic material; are on a slightly higher landscape position.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. Permeability is very slow. 
Runoff is low on 0 to 1 percent slopes, medium on 1 to 3 percent slopes, high on 
3 to 5 percent slopes and very high on 5 to 8 percent slopes. Water enters the 
soil rapidly when it is cracked and dry and very slowly when it is moist. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for pasture and rangeland. Scattered areas are 
cultivated mainly to grain sorghum, small grain and introduced grasses. Native 
vegetation includes grasses such as alkali sacaton, sideoats grama, plains 
bristlegrass, twoflower trichloris, tobosagrass, vine-mesquite, pinhole 
bluestem, and buffalograss. Woody vegetation includes mesquite, agarita, and 
pricklypear cactus. The ecological site is Rolling Blackland 18-25 PZ (083BY632TX). 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern and Western Rio Grande Plain, Texas; LRR I, MLRA 83A and 83B; large extent.
