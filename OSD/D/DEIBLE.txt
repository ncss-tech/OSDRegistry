DEIBLE SERIES 

The Deible series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in either silty colluvium or loess and the underlying alluvium on stream terraces and footslopes. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The average annual temperature is 56 degrees F, and the average annual precipitation is 40 inches. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, mixed, active, mesic Typic Albaqualfs 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Deible silt loam, on a plane 5 percent slope in a soybean field at an elevation of 975 feet.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

   Ap1--0 to 5 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; weak very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; common very fine and fine roots; 10 percent chert gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary.

   E--10 to 15 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) and light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silt loam; common fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) and common fine prominent red (2.5YR 4/8) masses of iron accumulation; weak very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 14 percent chert gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt wavy boundary.

(Combined thickness of the Btg horizon is 14 to 52 inches)

   2Btg4--37 to 51 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) silty clay loam; many medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) masses of iron accumulation; moderate fine and medium prismatic structure; firm; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; common black (10YR 2/1) masses of manganese or iron-manganese accumulation on faces of peds; strongly acid (pH 5.4); gradual wavy boundary. 

   2Btg5--51 to 65 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) silty clay loam; many coarse prominent strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) masses of iron accumulation; moderate fine and medium prismatic structure; firm; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; many black (10YR 2/1) masses of manganese or iron-manganese accumulation on faces of peds; moderately acid (pH 5.8).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Deible soils are on nearly level to gently sloping stream terraces and footslopes.  They formed in either silty colluvium or loess and the underlying alluvium. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual temperature varies from about 54 to 57 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation varies from about 35 to 45 inches. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bearthicket, Higdon, Horsecreek, and Racoon soils.  All of these soils have less clay in the particle size control section and are on slightly lower elevations.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained.  Runoff is typically high to very high, but is negligible in concave positions.  Permeability is very slow and the saturated hydraulic conductivity is low.  A seasonal high water table with an upper depth from 0 to 1 feet is present intermittently from December to May in most years. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used for cultivated crops or pasture.  Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The Ozark Highland region (MLRA 116A) of southern Missouri.  The series is of moderate extent.
