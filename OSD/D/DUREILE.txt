COMPETING SERIES: These are the Beales (AK), Chistna (AK), Chistochina (AK), Gustavus, (AK) Kismetpeak (WY), and Mahloriver (AK) soils.
Kismetpeak soils are somewhat excessively drained, have a paralithic contact within 100 cm (39 in), and have alluvium or colluvium parent material.
Beals soils are somewhat excessively drained, do not have coarse fragments in the parent material, and occur on hills and plains.
Chistina soils are somewhat excessively drained, and a thin cambic horizon.
Chistochina soils are somewhat excessively drained and have a loess mantle.
Gustavus soils lack an A horizon and occur on outwash deltas from 0 to 50 m in elevation.
Mahloriver soils have a folistic epipedon and occur on kames and glacial valley floors.
