DIAMONKIT SERIES

The Diamonkit series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived from sandstone and shale.  These soils are on gently to strongly sloping strath terrace breaks and on undulating to rolling hills.  Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Ustic Argigypsids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Diamonkit sandy loam on a concave, west-facing slope of 4 percent with native grass vegetation utilized as rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 1 inch; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick)

    Bt--1 to 3 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak thin platy structure parting to weak fine granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots, few very fine pores; few distinct clay films on faces of peds; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 9 inches thick)

    Btk--3 to 11 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; strong medium and coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots, common very fine pores; many prominent clay films on faces of peds; violently effervescent, calcium carbonate disseminated and as common distinct threads and soft masses, calcium carbonate equivalent of 10 percent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth boundary.  (8 to 17 inches thick)

    Bky1--11 to 19 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots, common very fine pores; few distinct clay films on faces of peds; violently effervescent, calcium carbonate disseminated and as common medium threads and soft masses, calcium carbonate equivalent of 7 percent; common fine soft masses of gypsum; EC of 0.4 mmhos; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 22 inches thick)

    2Bky2--19 to 33 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist massive; slightly hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine roots, few very fine pores; strongly effervescent, calcium carbonate disseminated and as few fine threads, calcium carbonate equivalent of 7 percent; common distinct threads and soft masses of gypsum; EC of 4.6 mmhos; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (9 to 14 inches thick)

    2Cr--33 inches; soft sandstone interbedded with shale; many feet thick.
