DOSIE SERIES

The Dosie series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from andesite and basalt.  Dosie soils are on plateaus and mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, mesic Pachic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Dosie very gravelly loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is partially covered with 30 percent stones, 15 percent cobbles, and 10 percent gravel.

(5 to 13 cm thick)

    A2--8 to 13 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) extremely gravelly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 45 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 10 cm thick)

    Bt1--13 to 20 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) extremely gravelly clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 45 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 13 cm thick)

    Bt2--20 to 33 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/2) very cobbly clay, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; strong fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; many distinct pressure faces; 25 percent gravel and 30 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 25 cm thick)

    Bt3--33 to 58 cm; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) very gravelly clay, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; strong fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; distinct pressure faces; 40 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.  (23 to 38 cm thick)

    Bt4--58 to 104 cm; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) extremely gravelly clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; strong very fine and fine angular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few fine tubular pores; distinct pressure faces; 50 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (25 to 50 cm thick)

    R--104 cm; hard basalt.

TYPE LOCATION:  Washoe County, Nevada; about 20 miles northwest of Gerlach in the Buffalo Hills; approximately 1,200 feet south and 2,500 feet west of the northeast corner of section 10, T. 33 N., R. 20 E.; USGS Poodle Mountain 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 45 minutes 41 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 42 minutes 58 seconds W; 
WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.7613889 latitude, -119.7161111 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually moist in winter, spring, and late fall, dry in summer, early and mid-fall; aridic soil moisture regime that borders on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 12 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 50 to 104 cm; includes the upper subdivisions of the argillic horizon.
Depth to base of argillic horizon: 100 to 150 cm.
Depth to bedrock: 100 to 150 cm to a lithic contact.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  Averages 35 to 50 percent.
Rock fragments: Averages 35 to 60 percent, mainly gravel.  Lithology of fragments is volcanic rocks such as andesite and basalt.

A horizons
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.
Reaction:  Slightly acid or neutral.

Bt horizons
Hue: 5YR through 10YR.
Value:  3 or 4, dry or moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4, dry or moist.
Texture (fine-earth fraction):  Clay loam or clay.
Clay content: 35 to 50 percent; the Bt1 horizon typically has less than 35 percent.
Rock fragments: 35 to 65 percent in any subhorizon.
Structure:  Subangular blocky or angular blocky.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Drakce, Gurdane, Kishwalk, Mallory, Tablerock, Thiessen, and Zweygardt series.

Drakce soils have a xeric moisture regime that borders on aridic.  Gurdane, Kishwalk, Mallory, and Thiessen soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Tablerock and Zweygardt soils are very deep and have a xeric moisture regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dosie soils are on plateaus and mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from andesite and basalt.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,500 to 2,200 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 65 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Devada, Hart Camp, and Softscrabble soils.  Devada soils are shallow to lithic contacts.  Hart Camp soils are shallow to paralithic contacts.  Softscrabble soils are loamy-skeletal and have a frigid temperature regime.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; very high surface runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Dosie soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, currant, bluebunch wheatgrass, basin wildrye, and pine bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Nevada and northeastern California.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 23.
