DIVOT SERIES

The Divot series consists of well drained, very deep, slowly and moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous clayey or loamy alluvium.  These nearly level soils occur on flood plains and flood plain steps.  Slope is mostly less than 1 percent, but ranges up to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 21.1 degrees C (70 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm (26 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, hyperthermic Pachic Vertic Haplustolls

COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Eloso series in the same family. Similar soils are the Frio, Krum, Laredo, Nukrum, and Rioconcho series.
Eloso soils: are less than 102 cm (40 in) deep to siltstone and occur in clayey alluvial sediments over the Catahoula siltstone.
Frio, Krum, Nukrum, and Rioconcho soils: have mean annual soil temperatures less than 72 degrees F. In addition, Nukrum and Rioconcho soils have mixed mineralogy.
Laredo soils have mixed mineralogy and have a COLE of less than 0.07. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Atco, Castroville, Hanis, and Sabenyo series.  
Atco soils: do not have mollic epipedons, have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections with carbonatic mineralogy, and occur on higher uplands.  
Castroville soils: have fine-silty particle-size control sections with mixed mineralogy, have a calcic horizon, and occur on higher uplands or terraces.  
Hanis soils: are redder and occur on higher positions in the landscape
Sabenyo soils: do not have a mollic epipedon and have carbonatic mineralogy

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; Runoff is medium or low; Slow and moderately slow permeability.  Flooding occurs for periods of less than 24 hours at intervals ranging from 1 or more times a year to once in 20 years.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for cropland and rangeland.  Cropland is used mainly for crops such as grain sorghum, small grain, and introduced grasses under both dryland and irrigated operations. Some corn, cotton, and truck crops are also grown under irrigation.  The native vegetation consists of about 15 percent trees and other woody plants such as elm, hackberry, pecan, liveoak and a few large mesquite trees with an understory of predominantly mid grasses.  With retrogression, woody shrubs and short grasses increase or invade.  Typical increasers and invaders are curlymesquite, Hall's panicum, threeawn, whitebrush, Texas persimmon, condalias, spiny hackberry, and annual forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Rio Grande Plain (MLRA 83A) and the Western Rio Grande Plain (MLRA 83B) of Texas.  The series is of moderate extent.
