DRIT SERIES

The Drit series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from granitic and metavolcanic rocks.  Drit soils are on mountain backslopes.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Pachic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Drit gravelly coarse sandy loam, rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

B2 horizon
Value:  4 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Dehlinger, Demox, Gamboa, Goldmountain, Hannarocks, Langrell, Murken, Packard, Plumas, Raster, Watterson and Wrenthan series.   

Dehlinger soils have a loam or clay loam particle-size control section. Demox soils are mildly alkaline.  Gamboa soils have a minimum thickness of the mollic epipedon of 100 cm. Goldmountain, Hannarocks and Murken soils have bedrock at 50 to 100 cm. Langrell, Murken and Raster soils are usually dry for less than 90 days and are not dominated by 2 to 5 mm gravel. Packard soils have a loam or clay particle-size control section with 25 to 35 percent clay. Watterson soils have lack a cambic horizon. Wrenthan soils have a silt loam or silty clay loam particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Drit soils are on north facing mountain backslopes at elevations of 1,524 to 2,134 meters.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium weathered from granitic and metavolcanic rocks.  The climate is cold, moist winters and warm dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm; and the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C.  The frost-free season is 80 to l00 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Glean, Roloc, and Trid soils.  Glean soils have a frigid soil temperature regime.  Roloc soils are shallow and have an argillic horizon.  Trid soils are moderately deep and have a very gravelly argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, and Thurber's needlegrass with invasion of singleleaf pinyon.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  The series is of small extent. MLRA 26.
