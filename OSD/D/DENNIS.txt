DENNIS SERIES

The Dennis series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from shale of Pennsylvanian age. These soils are on interfluves and hillslopes. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Eram and Garton series. Eram soils have sola terminated by bedrock within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Garton soils have hue redder than 10YR in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dennis soils are on interfluves and hillslopes on plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent but is commonly between 1 and 5 percent. The soils formed in residuum weathered from shale of Pennsylvanian age. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 940 to 1168 mm (37 to 46 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 14 to 17 degrees C (57 to 63 degrees F). Thornthwaite Annual P-E Index is greater than 64.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bates, Collinsville, Okemah, and Parsons soils. Bates soils have a fine-loamy control section, have a thinner solum, and are on slightly higher side slopes. Collinsville soils lack an argillic horizon, have sandstone within 51 cm (20 inches) of the soil surface, and are on slightly higher ridge crests and side slopes. Okemah soils have a thicker mollic epipedon and are on adjacent, slightly concave areas. Parsons soils have an ochric epipedon, an abrupt change of texture, and are on adjacent, slightly concave areas.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 30 to 76 cm (12 to 30 inches) between December and April in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is low to high depending on slope gradient. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used for growing crops. Principal crops are small grains, sorghums, soybeans, and some cotton. Some tame pasture are grown. Lesser amounts are used for native range. Native vegetation is tall grass prairie.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mostly in MLRA 112 with a lesser extent in MLRA 76 and LRUs 84A, 116A, and 118B, in southeastern Kansas, southwestern Missouri, and eastern Oklahoma. The type location is in MLRA 112. The series is extensive.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 28 cm (11 inches) (A horizon).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 43 to 173 cm (17 to 68 inches) (Bt horizon).
Aquic conditions: redox features in all horizons below a depth of 33 cm (13 inches). 

12/2015 revision: updated redox features terminology; added geographic coordinates; added sand and clay content ranges; changed E and BE horizons to AB and BA horizons, respectively, under RIC; changed Ksat from very low to moderately low based on review of NASIS data; added MLRA 76 and LRUs 84A, 116A, and 118B to extent.
