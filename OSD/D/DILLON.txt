DILLON SERIES 

The Dillon series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on flood plains, flood-plain steps and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Oxyaquic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Dillon silt loam, in cropland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Ap--0 to 4 inches; gray (2.5Y 5/1) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine and few fine interstitial pores; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw--4 to 11 inches; gray (2.5Y 6/1) silt loam, dark gray (2.5Y 4/1) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine and few fine tubular and interstitial pores; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 10 inches thick)

    BC--11 to 31 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/1) loam, gray (2.5Y 6/1) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; common very fine and few fine tubular and interstitial pores; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 20 inches thick)

    2C1--31 to 36 inches; light gray (5Y 7/1) loamy sand, gray (5Y 6/1) moist; common medium and fine distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist redox concentrations; single grain; loose; nonsticky and nonplastic; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick)

    2C2--36 to 60 inches; light gray (5Y 7/1) very gravelly sand, gray (5Y 6/1) moist; single grain, loose; nonsticky and nonplastic; 40 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).
