DILLWYN SERIES 


The Dillwyn series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in eolian sand. These soils are on dunes and interdunes on paleo-terraces in river valleys of the Great Bend Sand Plains (MLRA 79). Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 24 inches (61 centimeters), and mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F (13 degrees C). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, mesic Aquic Ustipsamments 

TYPICAL PEDON: Dillwyn loamy fine sand - in native grass. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.) 

A--0 to 8 inches (0 to 20 centimeters); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loamy fine sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick; 10 to 25 centimeters thick) 

AC--8 to 28 inches (20 to 71 centimeters); pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; common coarse prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; single grained; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary. (4 to 25 inches thick; 10 to 64 centimeters thick) 

C1--28 to 35 inches (71 to 89 centimeters); very pale brown (10YR 7/3) fine sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; common coarse prominent reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/6) redoximorphic concentrations; single grained, nonsticky and nonplastic; loose; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 20 inches thick; 0 to 50 centimeters thick) 

C2--35 to 80 inches (89 to 203 centimeters); very pale brown (10YR 7/3) fine sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; common coarse prominent reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/6) redoximorphic concentrations; single grained, nonstick and nonplastic; loose; moderately acid. 

TYPE LOCATION: Stafford County, Kansas; 15 miles (24.1 kilometers) north and 10 1/2 miles (16.9 kilometers) east of St. John, Kansas; 1,400 feet (427 meters) south and 2,440 feet (744 meters) east of the northwest corner of sec. 17, T. 21 S., R. 11 W.

COMPETING SERIES: The Els (NE) series is the only competing series its family. Els soils have a lower mean annual soil and air temperature.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dillwyn soils are on nearly level to gently sloping dunes and interdunes. They formed in eolian sands. Slope gradient ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual temperature ranges from 55 to 57 degrees F (13 to 14 degrees C). The mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 35 inches (56 to 89 centimeters). Thornthwaites Annual P-E Index ranges from 34 to 54. (86 to 137 centimeters)
Parent material: sandy eolian deposits 
Landform: dunes and interdunes on paleoterraces.
Slopes: 0 to 3 percent
Elevation: 1200 to 2100 feet (365.8 to 640.1 meters)
Mean annual air temperature: 55 to 57 degrees F (13 to 14 degrees C).
Mean annual precipitation: 22 to 35 inches (56 to 89 centimeters).
Wettest months: Mar. to Oct.
Driest months: Nov. to Feb..
Frost-free period: 185 to 227 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aline, Dillhut (Tentative), Goltry, Plev (Tentative), Plevna, Pratt, Solvay (Tentative), Tivin (Tentative) and Tivoli soils. Aline, Goltry, Pratt, Tivin and Tivoli soils are on higher positions which have undulating to dune like topography. Aline and Goltry soils have argillic horizons. Pratt, Tivin and Tivoli soils do not have redoximorphic concentrations within depths of 40 inches (102 centimeters). The fine-loamy Solvay soils are on similar or slightly lower positions as Dillwyn soils. The Plevna and Plev soils are in depressional areas below the Dillwyn soils. The Dillhut soils are on similar positions as Dillwyn soils but have a loamy paleosol between 20 to 40 inches (50 to 102 centimeters).

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained, very low runoff, rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for native rangeland. Native vegetation is tall grasses dominated by big bluestem, switchgrass, indiangrass, and eastern gramagrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Kansas and north-central Oklahoma. LRR H, MLRA 79. This series is of moderate extent.
