DELWIN SERIES

The Delwin series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in eolian sands over loamy ancient alluvium.  These nearly level to moderately sloping soils are on wind reworked sandsheets of terraces on dissected plains of the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78B, 78C).  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm (26 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 16.7 degrees C (62 degrees F).
