DELENBAW SERIES

The Delenbaw series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and alluvium from volcanic rock.  Delenbaw soils are on mesas and mesa escarpments and have slopes of 3 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, mesic Aridic Argiustolls

TYPE LOCATION:  Mohave County, Arizona; about 11.7 miles south of the Arizona-Utah state line and 17 miles east of the Arizona-Nevada state line on Black Rock Mountain; 1400 feet south and 500 feet east of the northwest corner of section 31, T.40 N., R.13 W.; 36 degrees, 49 minutes, 31 seconds North Latitude and 113 degrees, 44 minutes, 29 seconds West Longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Delenbaw soils are on mesas and mesa escarpments and have slopes of 3 to 25 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium and alluvium derived dominantly from basalt but include influences from other volcanic rocks.  Elevations range from 5800 to 6500 feet.  The mean annual air temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches.  The frost-free period is 135 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Luzena, Pocum, Springerville and Yellowhorse series.  Luzena soils have a lithic contact within 20 inches of the surface.  Pocum soils have a petrocalcic horizon within 20 inches of the surface.  Springerville and Yellowhorse soils average less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Delenbaw soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is juniper, pinyon pine, Utah serviceberry, big sagebrush, cliffrose, junegrass, and crested, intermediate, and western wheatgrasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Arizona.  This series is of small extent.  MLRA is 39.
