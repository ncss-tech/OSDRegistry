DONPEDRO SERIES

The Donpedro series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum weathered from slate. The Donpedro soils are on low hills. Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 570 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C.
