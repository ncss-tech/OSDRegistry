DRYWOLF SERIES  

The Drywolf series consists of very deep, well over excessively drained soils that formed in rock slide deposits, frost shattered residuum, and colluvium from mixed igneous sources.  These soils occur on mountain slopes and avalanche chutes.  Slopes are 8 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 760 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal over fragmental, mixed, superactive Typic Haplocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Drywolf very gravelly sandy loam, in forest on a 25 percent north slope at an elevation of 2438 meters (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

 Oi--0 to 3 cm; slightly decomposed forest litter; clear smooth boundary.(1 to 5 cm thick)

 A--3 to 16 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 30 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; strongly acid (pH 5.2); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 15 cm thick) 

 Bw--16 to 46 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very cobbly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 25 percent gravel and 30 percent cobbles; strongly acid (pH 5.2); gradual wavy boundary. (20 to 40 cm thick) 

 C--46 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR6/3) extremely cobbly loamy sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; many fine, medium, coarse and very coarse interstitial pores, primarily in packing voids; 50 percent gravel, 40 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; strongly acid (pH 5.2).
