DELSON SERIES

The Delson series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvial material derived from sedimentary rocks and from residuum and colluvium from sandstone and shale. Delson soils are on stony outwash fans, benches, mountain and mesa side slopes. Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Delson stony loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 20 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/2) stony loam, very dark brown (7.5YR 2/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many medium and fine roots; 5 percent stones; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (10 to 38 cm thick)

    BA--20 to 30 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark brown (7.5YR 2/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate coarse granular; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; thin patchy clay films on faces of peds; many medium and fine roots; 5 percent stones; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 20 cm thick)

    Bt--30 to 86 cm; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) light clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium angular blocky; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and plastic; moderately thick continuous clay films on faces of peds; few medium and coarse roots; 10 percent stones; neutral; gradual wavy boundary. (25 to 76 cm thick)

    BC--86 to 107 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) stony clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few thin clay films on faces of peds; few coarse roots; 20 percent stones; neutral grading to slightly alkaline in lower part; gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 30 cm thick)

    C--107 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) stony clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; hard, sticky and slightly plastic; 30 percent stones; slightly alkaline.
