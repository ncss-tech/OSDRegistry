DEDMOUNT SERIES

The Dedmount series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine sediments derived from mixed rocks.  Dedmount soils are on alluvial flats and dissected lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, calcareous, mesic Vertic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Dedmount silty clay loam, rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 5 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak coarse platy structure; hard, very friable, sticky and plastic; few medium and coarse roots; common fine vesicular and interstitial pores; violently effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 20 cm thick)

    C1--5 to 25 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silty clay, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine to coarse roots; few fine and medium tubular pores; violently effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.6); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 46 cm thick)

    C2--25 to 56 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silty clay, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate, medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine to coarse roots; common fine to coarse tubular pores; common very pale brown (10YR 8/2) salt crystals; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); clear smooth boundary.  (20 to 46 cm thick)

    C3--56 to 109 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silty clay, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; common fine and medium tubular pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear smooth boundary.  (40 to 76 cm thick)

    Ck--109 to 168 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silty clay, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; few fine and medium faint very pale brown (10YR 7/3) mottles; massive; hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; common fine tubular pores; common large lime concretions violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  Mineral County, Nevada, about 2,500 feet north and 1,750 feet west of mud windmill, about 400 feet south and 900 feet east of northwest corner of section 15, T. 12 N., R., 33 E.; latitude 38 degrees 54 minutes 47 seconds N and longitude 118 degrees 15 minutes 21 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.9131667 latitude, -118.255833 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist for short periods during winter and early spring and for 10 to 20 days between July and October due to convective storms, otherwise dry, summer and autumn.  The soil is saturated between 100 and 152 cm for short periods in the late winter. Typic-aridic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 15 degrees C.
Effervescence: Slightly effervescent through violently effervescent.
Sodicity (SAR): 13 to 45, usually decreasing with depth.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  35 to 45 percent.

A horizon
Value:  6 dry, 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4 dry and moist.

C and Ck horizons
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y.
Value:  6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist.
Chroma: 1 through 4 dry and moist.
Texture:  Silty clay loam or silty clay with less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.
Reaction:  Strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Benin, Lahontan, Torchlight series.

Benin and Torchlight soils have gypsum crystals. Lahonton soils are not moist for short periods during winter and early spring and for 10 to 20 days between July and October due to convective storms. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dedmount soils are on alluvial flats and dissected lake plains.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium.  Elevations are 1,190 to 1,280 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 100 to 150 mm, mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 120 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Nuyobe, Slaw, and Isolde soils.  Isolde soils are sandy.  Nuyobe and Slaw soils are fine-silty.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained; negligible to high runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is big saltbush, black greasewood, seepweed and inland saltgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Nevada.  These soils are of small extent.
