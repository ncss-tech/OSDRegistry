DAILEY SERIES

The Dailey series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy eolian deposits.  Dailey soils are on concave areas and have slopes of 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Torriorthentic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Dailey loamy sand - grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

  A--0 to 16 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loamy sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; neutral; gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 26 inches thick)

  C--16 to 80 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grained; loose; neutral.

TYPE LOCATION: Logan County, Colorado; 375 feet east and 10 feet north of the southwest corner of Sec. 21, T. 9 N., R. 48 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Control section: excludes loamy very fine sand
Mean annual soil temperature: 47 to 58 degrees F.
Mean summer soil temperature: 59 to 79 degrees F.
Mollic epipedon organic carbon: .7 to 1.5 percent decreasing uniformly with depth
Mollic epipedon thickness: 10 to 20 inches
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent by volume - typically less than 2 percent

A horizon:
Hue: 2.5Y through 7.5 YR
Value: 4 to 5 dry, 2 to 3 moist
Chroma: 2 to 3
Consistence: loose to soft
Reaction: neutral to slightly alkaline
Texture: loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand 

C horizon:
Hue: 2.5Y through 7.5YR
Value: 6 dry, 5 moist
Chroma: 3
Reaction: neutral to slightly alkaline to 40 inches or more
Texture: loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand 
Comments: It is noncalcareous to 40 inches or more.  Some pedons have AC horizons and are moderately alkaline in the C horizon.

COMPETING SERIES:
Blakeland soils: have a high percentage of medium and coarse angular granitic sand or fine and very fine gravel, have very hard consistence when dry
Orsa soils: have a mollic epipedon thicker than 20 inches

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: sandhills
Landform: interdunes
Slopes: 0 to 12 percent
Elevation: 3000 to 5400 feet
Parent material: sandy eolian deposits
Mean annual air temperature: 46 to 55 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 15 to 19 inches
Frost-free period: 110 to 150 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Dwyer soils: lack a mollic epipedon, are calcareous above 40 inches
Valent soils: lack a mollic epipedon

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage: somewhat excessively
Runoff:  low
Permeability: rapid

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used principally as native pastureland; however, they are utilized for crops under irrigation in some localities.  Native vegetation is mainly sand sage, blue grama, needlegrass and bluestem.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Colorado, western Nebraska and Wyoming.  The series is of moderate extent.
