MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Halifax County, Virginia; 1999. 

REMARKS: Dan River soils were previously mapped as Riverview or Congaree soils (thermic series). Due to the establishment of mesic regions in the Southern Piedmont, this soil will be the mesic counterpart of Riverview and possibly Congaree series. 
Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon: 
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 9 inches (A horizon)
Cambic horizon--the zone from 9 to 56 inches (Bw1, Bw2, Bw3, and Bw4 horizons) 
Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Oxyaquic feature--indications of extended periods of saturation by the presence of redoximorphic features (masses and/or depletions) within 40 inches of the soil surface (Bw3 horizon)
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches
