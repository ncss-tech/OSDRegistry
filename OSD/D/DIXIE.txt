DIXIE SERIES

The Dixie series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from intermediate igneous and sedimentary rocks.  These soils are on fan terraces and hill footslopes and have slopes of 2 to 40 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Calciargids

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ackelton (ID), Paulville (ID), Sevy (UT), Stiles (CA), and Woozle (ID) series.  Ackelton soils have duripans below 40 inches. Paulville and Sevy soils have 0 to 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Stiles soils are moderately deep. Woozle soils have no coarse fragments in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dixie soils are on fan terraces, stream terraces, alluvial fans, fan remnants, and hill footslopes at elevations of 5,000 to 6,100 feet.  Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium from intermediate and basic igneous rocks and sedimentary rocks.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F, and the mean summer air temperature is 64 to 70 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.  The freeze-free period is 100 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Checkett and Sevy series.  Checkett soils are shallow over bedrock and occur in foothills.   Sevy soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the argillic horizon and occur on gently sloping fans downslope of the Dixie soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderately slow permeability (permeability may be very slow in cemented layers).
USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  A few areas are used for irrigated alfalfa, small grains and potatoes.  The native vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, galleta, snakeweed, threeawn, Indian ricegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Utah.  These soils are moderately extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Beryl-Enterprise Area, Utah, 1942.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon: The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 2 inches. (A horizon)

Argillic horizon: The zone of illuvial clay accumulation from a depth of about 6 to 26 inches. (Bt and part of the Btk horizons)

Calcic horizon: The zone of carbonate accumulation from a depth of about 10 to 60 inches. (Btk and Bk horizons)

This soil was reclassified from a Xeralfic Haplargids to Xeric Calciargids on 9/94.

The type location was change 9/94 to better represent the series.
