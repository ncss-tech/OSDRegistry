DANKWORTH SERIES

The Dankworth series consist of very deep, excessively drained rapidly permeable soils formed in sandy alluvium on foot slopes and fan remnants. Slopes range from 3 to 6 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, mesic Aridic Ustipsamments

TYPICAL PEDON: Dankworth loamy sand on a 5 percent north facing slope in rangeland. When described, the soil was moist throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  A--0 to 6 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loamy sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; 2 percent gravel by volume; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.

  AC--6 to 18 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; single grain; loose; 2 percent gravel by volume; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.

  C1--18 to 48 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) coarse sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; loose; 13 percent gravel by volume; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.

  C2--48 to 80 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) sand, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; single grain; loose; 2 percent gravel by volume; slightly acid.

TYPE LOCATION: Garden County, Nebraska; about 8 miles north and 5.5 miles east of Oshkosh Nebraska; 1900 feet north and 800 feet west of the southeast corner of section 23, T. 18 N., R. 43 W. Gusher Springs topographic quadrangle; lat. 41 degrees, 31 minutes N. and long. 102 degrees, 14 minutes, 50 seconds W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
The weighted average of gravel ranges from 2 to 15 percent by volume throughout the particle size control section but some layers may range up to 25 percent 
Reaction: slightly acid to neutral throughout and typically lacks free carbonates

A horizon: 
Hue: 10YR 
Value: 4 or 5, 3 or 4 moist 
Chroma: 2 or 3

AC horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value:  4 through 6, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: sand or loamy sand

C horizon: 
Hue of 10YR
Value: 5 through 7, 4 through 6 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: sand or coarse sand

COMPETING SERIES: 
Blueridge soils have 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments throughout the particle size control section 
Colfer soils have contrasting loamy layers in the lower part of the series control section
Scoville  have contrasting loamy layers at depths below 40 inches 
Optima soils are warmer in May and June
Royosa  soils dryer in May and June

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: sandy alluvium 
Landscape: uplands
Landform: foot slopes and fan remnants
Slopes: 3 to 6 percent
Mean annual temperature:  47 to 53 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 14 to 18 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
Blueridge soils are higher on the landscape 
Sarben soils are coarse-loamy, have carbonates at depths below 15 inches and are formed in loamy and sandy eolian materials 
Valent soils are on dunes

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage: excessively drained 
Permeability:  rapid

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in native grass used for range.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Nebraska, and possibly eastern Wyoming and eastern Colorado. The series is of small extent.
