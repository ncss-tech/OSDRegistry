DAVILLA SERIES

The Davilla series consists of very deep to loamy alluvium, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium of Pleistocene age derived from mudstone.  These nearly level soils are on treads of Pleistocene stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 938 mm (36.92 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 20.2 degrees C (68.4 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no series in the same family. Similar soils are the Bremond, Bastsil, Chazos, and Gredge series.

Bastsil soils: have no clay decrease by more than 20 percent of the maximum clay content within 150 cm (60 in) from the soil surface and are in the active cation exchange capacity activity class

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loamy alluvium of Pleistocene age derived from mudstone
Landscape: Inland dissected coastal plains
Landform: stream terraces
Microfeature: Davilla soils are on the mounds.  The surface is typically mounded.  The mounds are oval and range from 6.1 to about 24.4 m (20 to about 80 ft) in diameter.  They are about 15 to 46 cm (6 to 18 in) above the associated intermound areas except where cultivation has smoothed and leveled the surface.  They are typically mapped in a complex with another soil.   
Slope: 0 to 2 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 813 to 1016 mm (32 to 40 in)
Thornthwaite P-E Index: 54 to 64
Mean annual air temperature: 18.8 to 20.5 degrees C (66 to 69 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 236 to 275 days
Elevation: 87.1 to 174.4 m (286 to 573 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Benchley, Chazos, Crockett, Edge, Gause, Gredge, Luling, and Wilson series. 
Benchley, Crockett, Edge, and Luling soils: have a solum that is underlain by geologic materials within a depth of 150 cm (60 in) and they have fine-textured control sections. They are slightly higher in the landscape and are on nearby uplands.  
Chazos and Gause soils: have fine textured control sections, are on similar stream terrace positions, and have a loamy fine sand epipedon
Gredge soils: have fine-textured control sections, are on similar stream terrace positions, and have an argillic horizon with reddish matrix colors
Wilson soils: have fine-textured control sections, are on similar stream terrace positions, have a very dark gray upper argillic horizon, and are mapped in complex with Davilla soils.  Wilson usually occurs on slightly lower intermound positions.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage class: Moderately well
Permeability: Very slow. 
Runoff: high on slopes less than 1 percent and very high on slopes of 1 to 2 percent.  
Wetness: The soil has masses of redoximorphic features, which are considered to be mainly relict features.  During wet years these soils may be saturated long enough to develop aquic soil conditions in some subhorizons.  However, in most years they do not have aquic soil conditions.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for improved pasture with coastal Bermuda grass and Bahia grass being the dominant improved grasses grown. Some areas are cropped to small grains, corn, or grain sorghum.  Some areas are in rangeland.  Native vegetation consists of medium and tall grasses such as big bluestem, sideoats grama, silver bluestem, Texas wintergrass, Florida paspalum, little bluestem, and yellow indiangrass and scattered trees such as elm, hackberry, mesquite and post oak.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South central, Texas; Land Resource Region J - Southwestern Prairies Cotton and Forage Region; Texas Blackland Prairies, Northern and Southern Parts (MLRAs 86A and 86B) and Texas Claypan Area, Southern Part (MLRA 87A); the series is of moderate extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES PROPOSED: Milam County, Texas, 1988. The name is from a small community in Western Milam County close to the type location.

REMARKS: Classification changed (2/94) from Aquic subgroup to Udic subgroup based on changes in aquic soil definitions and moisture data from similar soils.  These soils were previously included with the Crockett series.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle size control section: 25 to 75 cm (10 to 30 in) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons) 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in). The soil is massive and hard when dry. (A horizon) 
Argillic horizon: 25 to 203 cm (10 to 80 in). (Bt1, Bt2, Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, Btg4 horizons)
Redoximorphic concentrations: 25 to 203 cm (10 to 80 in). (Bt1, Bt2, Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, and Btg4 horizons)
Redoximorphic depletions: 25 to 86 cm (10 to 34 in). (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Other features: Most pedons are underlain with beds of sand and/or gravel below a depth of 3 m (10 ft).

ADDITIONAL DATA: TAMU/KSSL Data from 4 pedons shows the weighted average clay content of the control section ranges from 28 to 34 percent.  However, the field texture method suggests a fine family.
