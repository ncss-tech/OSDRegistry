DRAPER SERIES

The Draper series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in noncalcareous, medium textured alluvium.  The Draper soils are on alluvial fans. Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Cumulic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Draper loam, cultivated.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap--0 to 8 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many medium and fine roots; many fine pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick)

    A1--8 to 21 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) heavy loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak medium blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many medium and fine roots; many fine pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 20 inches thick)

    A2--21 to 30 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak medium prismatic structure that parts to weak medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many medium and fine roots; many fine pores; neutral (pH 7.3); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 12 inches thick)

    C1--30 to 53 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; many fine faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) mottles; massive, hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear smooth boundary.  (20 to 40 inches thick)

    C2--53 to 60 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; many medium distinct reddish brown (5YR 5/4) mottles; massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; slightly calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1).

TYPE LOCATION:  Davis County, Utah; about 1 mile NW of Bountiful; 500 feet north and 150 feet east of the southwest corner, section 18, T.2N., R.1E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is saturated within 40 inches of the surface for more than 90 days when not frozen, unless artificially drained. Mottles occur between 30 and 60 inches.

In some places, the soil contains 15 to 20 percent fine gravel. 

The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or less. Organic matter content is most commonly 3 to 5 percent, but ranges from 2.5 to 12 percent. The surface layer is slightly calcareous in some places where the soil is associated with other calcareous soils or where they are irrigated with calcareous water.

The C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Considerable stratification occurs in the C horizon. The C horizon is slightly calcareous in some places.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Birdow (UT), Blackrock (UT), Coit (NV), Collister (ID), Dagor (UT), Eastcan (UT), Goose Creek (ID), Goosenawt (ID), Gosinta (ID), Heidtman (NV), Lakeview (OR), Monroe (UT), Oxy (WA), Shoepeg (ID), Willowdale (OR), and Winn (UT) series.

Birdow, Blackrock, Dagor, Goosenawt, Monroe and Willowdale soils are well drained and lack mottles between 30 and 60 inches.

Coit soils are poorly drained and have 2 chroma mottles above 30 inches.

Collister soils are neutral or slightly acid.

Eastcan and Winn soils are moderately or strongly calcareous throughout.

Goose Creek and Heidtman soils have an aridic moisture regime.

Gosinta soils have 2C horizons.

Lakeview soils formed in igneous rock with an influence of ash.

Oxy soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock.

Shoepeg soils have 2C horizons and are deep or very deep to bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Draper soils are on smooth to slightly undulating, nearly level to strongly sloping, alluvial fans on slopes ranging from 0 to 10 percent.  These soils formed in noncalcareous, medium textured alluvium, derived primarily from granite, gneiss, schist and quartzite rocks.  The climate is dry subhumid with an average annual precipitation ranging from 14 to 20 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ironton soils and the competing Woods Cross and Pleasant View soils.  Ironton soils are calcareous throughout and have calcic horizons within 16 inches of the surface.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; slow runoff; moderate permeability in the A horizon and slow to rapid permeability in the C horizon.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for crops, pasture, and meadow.  Where drained it is used for irrigated cropland, mainly for growing truck crops.  The native vegetation is mainly saltgrass, Kentucky bluegrass, cheatgrass, alkali grass, and rose bushes.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central southern and northern Utah, and southern Idaho. The soil is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: The superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data.
