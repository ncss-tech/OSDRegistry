DUTCHHOLLOW SERIES

The Dutchhollow series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  These soils occur on flood plains, stream terraces and drainageways.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous Typic Cryaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Dutchhollow loam, in rangeland on a 1 percent slope at an elevation of 2073 meters (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted).

 A--0 to 28 cm; black (10YR 2/1) loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; moderate medium granular structure; moderately hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (18 to 30 cm thick)

 Ag--28 to 46 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; 28 percent medium prominent brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) redox concentrations; weak medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (12 to 30 cm thick)

 Cg1--46 to 79 cm; dark bluish gray (5B 4/1) clay loam, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; massive; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 5 percent gravel; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; slightly effervescent moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary (15 to 35 cm thick)

 2Cg2--79 to 152 cm; variegated extremely gravelly loamy sand; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; 65 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).

TYPE LOCATION: Beaverhead County, Montana; located about 400 feet south and 300 feet east of the southwest corner of sec. 11, T. 15 S., R 7 W; Snowline topographic quadrangle; UTM 12T, 0386403e., 4933974n. NAD 83.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - flood plains, stream terraces and drainageways
Elevation - 1980 to 2270 meters
Slope - 0 to 4 percent
Parent material - alluvium derived from mixed sources  
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; short warm summers
Mean annual precipitation - 380 to 485 mm
Mean annual air temperature - 2 to 5 degrees C.
Frost-free period - 50 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained; moderate over rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Dutchhollow soils are used mainly for wildlife, irrigated pasture and rangeland.  The vegetation is mainly sedges, rushes, and miscellaneous grasses and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Dutchhollow soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.  MLRA - 44B.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Horse Prairie-South Valley Area - Part of Beaverhead County, Montana, 2011; proposed in Beaverhead County, Montana, 2011.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - from 0 to 46 cm (A and Ag horizons)
Redoximorphic features (iron concentrations/depletions) - beginning at a depth of 28 cm (Ag, Cg1 and 2Cg2 horizons)
Particle-size control section - from 25 to 100 cm (part of A, Ag, Cg1, and part of the 2Cg2 horizons) with a strongly contrasting particle-size class between the fine-loamy (Cg1) horizon and the sandy-skeletal (2Cg2) horizon. 

Dutchhollow soils have a cryic temperature regime and an aquic moisture regime.
