DONLONTON SERIES

The Donlonton series consists of very deep, moderately well and somewhat poorly drained soils formed in old marine sediments containing moderate amounts of glauconite.  They are nearly level and gently sloping soils on the northern Atlantic Coastal Plain.  Typically these soils have fine sandy loam A horizons, olive brown sandy clay loam and sandy clay Bt horizons and dark olive green fine sandy loam C horizons high in glauconite.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, glauconitic, mesic Aquic Hapludults

TYPICAL PEDON:  Donlonton fine sandy loam--forested. (Colors are for moist soils.)

    A--0 to 2 inches; very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/20 fine sandy loam; moderate fine granular structure; friable, slightly
sticky, slightly plastic; many roots; very strongly acid;
abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 3 inches thick)

    E--2 to 12 inches; olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) fine sandy loam; weak fine granular structure; very friable, slightly sticky; many
roots; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 14
inches thick)

    Bt1--12 to 20 inches; olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) sandy clay loam; strong medium angular blocky and subangular blocky structure;
friable and firm, sticky, plastic; many roots; thin almost
continuous clay coats; sand component is dominantly fine;
very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 10 inches
thick)

    Bt2--20 to 32 inches; olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) sandy clay; few medium distinct mottles of strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) and
greenish gray (5GY 6/1); strong medium blocky structure;
friable and firm, sticky, plastic, few roots; prominent clay
coats; glauconite distintly evident; sand component is dom-
inantly fine; apparent low bulk density; very strongly acid;
abrupt smooth boundary.  (10 to 14 inches)

    Bt3--32 to 50 inches; olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) sandy clay; common medium and coarse prominent mottles of strong brown (7.5YR
5/8) and greenish gray (5GY 6/1); weak and moderate very
coarse angular blocky structure; firm, sticky, plastic; very
few roots; discontinuous light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) clay
films; glauconite distinctly evident; few fine smooth peb-
bles; very strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (10 to 19
inches)

    C -- 50 to 60 inches; dark olive green (5GY 3/2) fine sandy loam; massive; very friable, slightly sticky; many glauconite
grains; very strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Prince Georges County, Maryland; on Tobacco Experiment Station of University of Maryland, near Upper Marlboro.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Thin strata containing ferruginous sandstone (ironstone) or ferruginous concretions are in the solum, and thicker but discontinuous strata are in the C horizon of some pedons.  The soil is strongly or very strongly acid unless limed.

The A and E horizons have hues of 2.5Y or 10YR, values of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 8, witdh lowest values and chromas confined to A horizons.  They are fine sandy loam, loam, or loamy fine sand.

The B horizon has hues of 10YR through 5Y, values of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 6.  Mottles have hues of 7.5YR through 5GY, value of 3 to 5, and chromas of 1 to 8.  The B horizon is heavy sandy clay loam or sandy clay.

The C horizon has hues or 10YR through 5G, values of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  The C horizon ranges from fine sandy loam to clay loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  The Coolsville, Crukze, Keyport, Kreamer, Latham, Rarden, Wharton,, and Zoar series are in the same family.  All of these soils lack glauconite.

The Adelphia, Conasauga, Craven, Creedmore, Fawsett, Helena, Holmdel, Kresson and Wolftener series are similar soils in related families.  Adelphia and Holmdel soils have less than 35 percent clay.  Conasauga, Craven, Helena, and Wolftener soils have mean annual temperatures greater than 50 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation of about 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Adelphia, Holmdel, and Kresson series and the Colemantown, Collington, Freehold, Howell, Marr, Monmouth, Shrewsbury, and Westphalia soils.  Colemantown and Shrewsbury are poorly drained.  Collington, Freehold, Howell, Marr, Monmouth, and Westphalia soils are well drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well and somewhat poorly drained.  Permeability is moderate to moderately slow in the A horizon, slow in the B horizon and moderate to moderately slow in the C horizon.  The water table is 1-1/2 to 2 feet from the surface for rather long periods.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for growing general crops and pasture, and with improved drainage for truck crops and tobacco.  The native vege- tation is mixed hardwoods, mostly white and black oak, yellow poplar, red maple, hickory, sweetgum, and dogwood.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Maryland and New Jersey (major land resource area 149).  The series is of small extent.
