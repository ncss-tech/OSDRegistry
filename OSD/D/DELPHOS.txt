DELPHOS SERIES

The Delphos series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils. These soils formed in loamy calcareous eolian sediments in the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. Delphos soils are on nearly level to gently sloping plains in broad, shallow basins or draws. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 406 mm (16 in), and mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C. (61 degrees F).

Amarose, Elida, Jalmar, and Vestwells soils: are on similar or slightly higher landscape positions and have argillic horizons. 
Ratliff soils: are on similar landscape positions. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained and moderately rapid permeability. Surface runoff is negligible on less than 1 percent slopes and very low on 1 to 3 percent slopes. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used primarily for rangeland. Native climax vegetation is tall and mid grasses, with tall grasses tending to dominate. This site is dominated by little bluestem and sand bluestem along with taller dropseed species. The remainder is mid and short grasses such as sideoats grama, sand dropseed, hooded windmillgrass, sand lovegrass, sand paspalum, fall witchgrass, hairy grama, needle and thread, and perennial threeawn. Sand sage, shinoak, and skunkbush are also present. This soil has been correlated to the Sandy (R077DY046TX) range site in MLRA-77D. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern High Plains, Southwestern Part (MLRA 77D in LRR H) of eastern New Mexico. The series is moderately extensive.
