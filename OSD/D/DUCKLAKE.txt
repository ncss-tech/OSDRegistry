DUCKLAKE SERIES

The Ducklake series consists of deep, well drained soils on glaciated slopes of mountains. Ducklake soils are formed in volcanic ash overlying glacial till from granite. Slopes are 5 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 57 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy over loamy-skeletal, amorphic over isotic Typic Vitricryands

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ducklake stony ashy silt loam - woodland, on a 40 percent north - facing slope at an elevation of 7050 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted. Textures are apparent field textures.)
