DOGHAIR SERIES

The Doghair series consists of deep or very deep, well drained soils that formed in pyroclastic colluvium over residuum. Doghair soils are on cinder cone remnants and have slopes of 3 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Doghair soils are at elevations of 5,900 to 6,800 feet on hills. Slopes are 5 to 50 percent. The soils formed in colluvium over residuum derived from pyroclastics including tuff, ash, cinders, and volcanic bombs. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 49 to 54 degrees F. The average annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 18 inches and occurs as thunderstorms in July, August and September and as rain and snow in the winter. The frost-free period ranges from 130 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cross, Wilaha, and Ziegler soils. Cross soils are less than 20 inches deep and are not carbonatic. Wilaha soils are less than 20 inches deep to a strongly contrasting particle size and are derived from cinders. Ziegler soils are moderately deep over cinders.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used primarily for livestock grazing. Vegetation is mainly blue grama, low woollygrass, barberry, bottlebrush squirreltail, broom snakeweed, galleta, green rabbitbrush, muttongrass, one-seed juniper, and twoneedle pinyon pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Arizona. The soils are limited in extent. MLRA is 39.
