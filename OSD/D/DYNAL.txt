DYNAL SERIES

The Dynal series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in beach sand and eolian sands derived mainly from oolites.  Dynal soils are on slightly elevated beach ridges and stable dunes.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Carbonatic, mesic Typic Torripsamments

TYPICAL PEDON:  Dynal sand--on a 4 percent convex east-facing slope--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 1 inch; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (1 to 6 inches thick)

    C1--1 to 14 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) sand, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 14 inches thick)

    C2--14 to 30 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) sand, light gray (10YR 7/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 25 inches thick)

    C3--30 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) sand, light gray (10YR 7/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; violently effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2).

TYPE LOCATION:  Tooele County, Utah; on the west side of Stansbury Island; approximately 1,000 feet south and 1,300 feet east of the northwest corner of section 16, T. 1 N., R. 6 W.; USGS Corral Canyon 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; 40 degrees 49 minutes 24 seconds north latitude and 112 degrees 31 minutes 40 seconds west longitude, NAD83; UTM zone 12N 371155E, 4520271N, NAD83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - The moisture control section in most years is dry in all parts more than three-fourths of the time when the soil temperature at 20 inches is above 41 degrees F, and is never moist in some or all parts for as long as 90 consecutive days; Typic torric moisture regime.

Mean annual soil temperature - 50 to 54 degrees F.

Calcium carbonate equivalent - 40 to 90 percent.

Salinity (EC) - 0 to 8 mmhos/cm.

Other features - Some pedons have sand-sized gypsum crystals.


A horizon - Value: 6 through 8 dry, 5 through 8 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.
Texture: Loamy sand, fine sand, or sand.
Reaction:  Slightly alkaline through strongly alkaline.


C horizons - Value: 6 through 8, dry or moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.
Texture: Sand or fine sand.
Reaction: Moderately alkaline through very strongly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dynal soils are on slightly elevated beach ridges and stable dunes along the edge of the Great Salt Lake.  They formed in beach sand and eolian sands derived mainly from oolites (ooliths).  Oolites are small, rounded, sand-sized accretionary bodies formed of concentric layers of calcium carbonate around a sand-sized nucleus of mineral or organic origin and formed in wave-agitated waters.  Mineral grains derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rocks are also a component of the soil parent material.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent and are both concave and convex.  Elevation ranges from 4,200 to 4,250 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 8 inches, the mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 120 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Tooele, Skumpah, and Saltair soils.  Tooele soils are coarse-loamy. Skumpah soils have natric horizons.  Saltair soils have salic horizons and a seasonal high water table at or near the surface.  All of these soils generally occur on slightly lower topographic positions than Dynal soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; very low surface runoff; rapid permeability (high or very high saturated hydraulic conductivity).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Dynal soils are used for rangeland.  Present vegetation is Indian ricegrass, black greasewood, rabbitbrush, fourwing saltbush, cheatgrass, and spiny hopsage.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Utah along the Great Salt Lake.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 28A.
