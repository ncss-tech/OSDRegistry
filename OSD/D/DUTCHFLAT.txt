DUTCHFLAT SERIES

The Dutchflat series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed igneous and metamorphic alluvium.  Dutchflat soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 0 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Dutchflat fine sandy loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 2 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) fine sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; common medium platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 10 percent gravel; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 3 inches thick)

    Bt--2 to 28 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on ped faces and in pores; 30 percent gravel; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (20 to 28 inches thick)

    2Btk--28 to 41 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on ped faces and in pores; 30 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; few very fine soft seams and filaments of calcium carbonate; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 13 inches thick)

    2Bk--41 to 60 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 40 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Anway (AZ), Avenal (CA), Bryman (CA), Bucklebar (NM), Garlock (CA), Hi Vista (CA), Lanip (NV) (T), Milham (CA), Neuralia (CA) and Palomas (NM), series.  Avenal, Bryman, Milham, and Neuralia soils are dry in the moisture control section during the summer months.  Garlock and Palomas soils have highly weathered granite above 40 inches.  Hi Vista soils have a lithic contact above 40 inches.  Anway, Bucklebar and Palomas soils are moist more than 20 cumulative days during July-September.  Lanip soils have calcium carbonate at depths of less than 9 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dutchflat soils are on fan terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  These soils formed in mixed igneous and metamorphic alluvium.  Elevations range from 2,400 to 4,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 12 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 200 to 250 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arizo, Franconia, Lostman and Whitehills soils.  Arizo soils are sandy-skeletal.  Franconia soils are sandy.  Whitehills soils are moderately deep to a duripan.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low or medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation includes big galleta, bush muhly, red brome, creosotebush, white bursage and range ratany.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Arizona.  This series is of moderate extent.  MLRA is 30.  The name is from a valley in the area.
