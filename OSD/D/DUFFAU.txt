DUFFAU SERIES

The Duffau series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy residuum weathered from sandstone and siltstone.  These nearly level to moderately sloping soils occur on footslopes and backslopes of ridges on hills. Slope are 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 864 mm (34 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, siliceous, active, thermic Udic Haplustalfs

The native plant community is post oak and blackjack oak, with an understory of little bluestem, indiangrass, greenbrier, and annual grasses.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Parker County, Texas, 1973. The name "Duffau" comes from the Duffau community in southeastern Erath County, Texas.

REMARKS:

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
Particle-size control section: 25 to 75 cm (10 to 30 in) (Bt1 horizon)
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in) (A and E horizons)
Argillic horizon: 25 to 178 cm (10 to 70 in) (Bt horizons)

Based on numerous field observations and update projects between 2017 and 2020 it was determined that the majority of observations within the Duffau series extent have a relative clay decrease of more than 20 percent from the maximum clay content of the argillic horizon within a depth of 150 cm. This is a characteristic related to current and past climate regimes that could be utilized to compete with series in wetter climates that previously classified to the same family.
