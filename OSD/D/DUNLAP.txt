DUNLAP SERIES

The Dunlap series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from weakly consolidated, coarse grained sandstone.  These soils occur on low hills.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid, shallow Aridic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Dunlap sandy loam, in rangeland on a 6 percent slope at an elevation of 1882 meters (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

   A--0 to 10 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots throughout; common very fine and fine irregular pores throughout; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 15 cm thick)

   Bt1--10 to 28 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots throughout; common very fine irregular pores throughout; 40 percent distinct patchy clay films on faces of peds; 18 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary.

   Bt2--28 to 41 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots throughout; few very fine irregular pores throughout; 40 percent faint patchy clay films on faces of peds; 22 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of Bt horizons - 20 to 38 cm)

   Cr--41 to 64 cm; highly weathered sandstone that crushes to a gravelly sand.  (15 to 50 cm thick)

   R--64 to 152 cm; hard sandstone bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION: Beaverhead County, Montana; located about 2360 feet south and 1150 feet east of the northwest corner of sec. 22, T. 9 S., R 13 W; Bachelor Mountain topographic quadrangle; UTM 12T, 327680e., 4989628n. NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Mean annual soil temperature - 5 to 8 degrees C.
Depth to top of argillic horizon - 8 to 15 cm
Depth to paralithic contact - 25 to 50 cm  
Depth to lithic contact - 50 to 100 cm

A horizon
Value: 4 or 5 dry; 3 or 4 moist 
Chroma: 2 or 3; dry or moist
Clay content: 15 to 20 percent

Bt horizons
Value: 5 or 6 dry; 4 or 5 moist 
Chroma: 2 to 4; dry or moist
Clay content: 20 to 35 percent 
Rock fragments: 10 to 30 percent gravel

COMPETING SERIES:  
Gateridge (WY) - does not have a lithic contact below the paralithic contact

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - low hills
Elevation - 1830 to 1920 meters
Slope - 2 to 15 percent
Parent material - residuum derived from weakly consolidated, coarse grained sandstone  
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers
Mean annual precipitation - 225 to 355 mm
Mean annual air temperature - 4 to 7 degrees C.
Frost-free period - 70 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Dunlap soils are used mainly for rangeland.  The vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, sandberg bluegrass, Indian ricegrass, needleandthread, and miscellaneous forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Dunlap soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.  MLRA - 44B.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Horse Prairie-South Valley Area - Part of Beaverhead County, Montana, 2011; proposed in Beaverhead County, Montana, 2008.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 10 cm (A horizon)
Argillic horizon - from 10 to 41 cm (Bt1, Bt2 horizons)
Paralithic contact - from 41 to 64 cm (Cr horizon)
Lithic contact - at 64 cm (R horizon)
Particle-size control section - from 10 to 41 cm (Bt1, Bt2 horizons)

Dunlap soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
