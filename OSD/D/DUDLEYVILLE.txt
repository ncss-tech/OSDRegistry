DUDLEYVILLE SERIES

The Dudleyville series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed from mixed fan alluvium and stream alluvium. Dudleyville soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces and have slopes of 1 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 67 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, thermic Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Dudleyville very gravelly loamy sand - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The surface is covered with 20 to 30 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles.

    C--0 to 4 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) very gravelly loamy sand, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak thin platy parting to weak very fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; many very fine roots; many very fine vesicular pores; 37 percent gravel; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline, pH 8.2; abrupt wavy boundary.

    Ck1--4 to 16 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly loamy sand, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; many very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; common distinct continuous calcium carbonate coats on rock fragments; 36 percent gravel; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline, pH 8.2; abrupt wavy boundary.

    Ck2--16 to 52 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very gravelly coarse sand, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; many very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; few faint patchy calcium carbonate coats on rock fragments; 5 percent cobbles and 48 percent gravel; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline, pH 8.0; clear smooth boundary.

    Ck3--52 to 60 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) extremely gravelly loamy sand, brown (7.5YR 5/4), moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; many very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; many distinct continuous calcium carbonate coats on rock fragments; 10 percent cobbles and 54 percent gravel; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline, pH 8.0. (Combined thickness of the C horizons is 50 to 80 inches)

TYPE LOCATION: Cochise County; located at latitude 32 degrees, 13 minutes, 15.00 seconds North and longitude 110 degrees, 18 minutes, 55.00 seconds West; about 650 feet west and 1,150 feet south of the northeast corner of section 17, Township 14 south, Range 20 east. USGS Quadrangle -Wildhorse Mtn.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July - September and December - February. Driest during May and June. Typic aridic soil moisture regime.

Soil temperature: 61 to 72 degrees F.

Rock fragments: averages more than 35 percent in the control section, some pedons range to 65 percent 

Reaction:  slightly to moderately alkaline

Clay content: 1 to 10 percent

Calcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 5 percent

C horizons
Hue:  10YR, 7.5YR
Value:  4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma:  3 or 4, dry or moist
Texture:  coarse sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, loamy sand, sandy loam

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Arizo (NV), Jean (NV) and Kokan (NM) series. Arizo and Jean soils are in the Mohave Desert (MLRA 30), receive mostly winter precipitation and are usually dry from April through November. Kokan soils are in the Chihuahuan Desert (MLRA 42) receive mostly summer precipitation and are usually dry from October through June.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dudleyville soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces at elevations of 2,000 feet to 3,800 feet. These soils formed in mixed fan alluvium and stream alluvium. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 7 to 12 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 59 to 70 degrees F. the frost-free period is 190 to 260 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Agustin, Hayhook, Bucklebar, and Yturbide soils.  Agustin and Hayhook soils are coarse-loamy.  Bucklebar soils are fine-loamy. Yturbide soils are sandy. Hayhook and Bucklebar soils are on fan terraces. Agustin and Yturbide are on adjacent landforms.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Excessively drained; negligible to low runoff: rapid to very rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat and recreation.  Vegetation is whitethorn, mesquite, catclaw, creosotebush, graythorn, and annual grasses. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern and western Arizona. Dudleyville soils are moderately extensive. MLRA is 40 and 41.
