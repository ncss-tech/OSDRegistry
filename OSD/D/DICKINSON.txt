DICKINSON SERIES

The Dickinson series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in glacial or alluvial deposits that have been reworked by wind. These soils are on interfluves on dissected till plains and on stream terraces in river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 30 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 840 millimeters.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Dickinson County, Iowa, 1920.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters (A1, A2, Bw1, Bw2, BC, and C horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (Ap, A1, A2, Bw1, Bw2, BC, and C horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 46 centimeters (Ap, A1, and A2 horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 46 to 91 centimeters (Bw1, Bw2, and BC horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Differences in texture in the material with depth are related to depositional sorting of material rather than soil development.

Series differentia between Filley series and Dickinson series needs further study.

A lacustrine substratum phase was correlated in Clay County, Iowa and is of very minor extent. It is on a lake plain.

A firm till substratum phase with a moist bulk density range of 1.65 to 1.75 g/cc is recognized in MLRA 103 on the Coteau Slope (bench) physiographic area

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
