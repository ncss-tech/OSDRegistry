DOUHIDE SERIES

The Douhide series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from volcanic rocks. Douhide soils are on mountains. Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, frigid Aridic Lithic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Douhide very gravelly loam--forestland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The surface is partly covered by approximately 15 percent stones and 20 percent gravel.

     A1--0 to 5 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak thin platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine and fine vesicular and tubular pores; 40 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 cm thick)

     A2--5 to 18 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; common fine tubular pores; 30 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary.  (13 to 23 cm thick)

     Bt1--18 to 23 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very cobbly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; common fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 20 percent gravel and 25 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 10 cm thick)

     Bt2--23 to 38 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very cobbly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; common fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 20 percent gravel and 30 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (10 to 20 cm thick)

     R--38 cm; fractured hard rhyolite with roots in fractures.

TYPE LOCATION:  Churchill County, Nevada; about 8.5 miles east-southeast of Eastgate; about  1900 feet north and 1,000 feet east of the southwest corner of section 8, T. 16 N., R. 38 E., USGS Carroll Summit 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 15 minutes 48 seconds N and longitude 117 degrees 44 minutes 01 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.2634444 latitude, -119.9172222 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry; moist in winter and spring, dry in summer and fall; aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon:16 to 30 cm.
Depth to bedrock: 36 to 50 cm to a lithic contact.
Reaction: Neutral or slightly alkaline.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 35 to 50 percent. 
Rock fragments: 35 to 50 percent, mostly cobbles. Lithology of fragments are volcanic rocks such as rhyolite and tuff.

A horizons
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR.
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3.

Bt horizons
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR.
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 3 or 4.
Texture (less than 2 mm fraction): Clay loam or clay

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the  Canest, Chen, and Graley series. 

Canest soils are 13 to 25 cm to a lithic contact. Chen soils have an abrupt boundary between the A and Bt horizons. Graley soils have mainly gravel in the particle-size control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Douhide soils are on mountains. They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Slopes are 30 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 1,675 to 2,440 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 70 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Duco and Ravenswood soils and the competing Itca soil. Duco soils are loamy-skeletal, shallow to lithic contacts, and have a mesic temperature regime. Ravenswood soils are clayey-skeletal and are moderately deep to lithic contacts.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained, very high surface runoff, moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Douhide soils are used for livestock grazing, wood products, and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is a forest canopy of singleleaf pinyon and Utah juniper with an understory of mountain big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Thurber needlegrass, antelope bitterbrush, and Idaho fescue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Nevada. This series is not extensive. MLRA 27 and 28B.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Churchill County Area, Nevada, 1995.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (A1 and A2 horizons).
Argillic horizon - The zone from 18 to 38 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).
Lithic contact - The boundary at 38 cm to underlying hard bedrock (R layer).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 18 to 38 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).

Classification was updated to 11th edition on 07/2011 changed Lithic Argixerolls to Aridic Lithic Argixerolls.
