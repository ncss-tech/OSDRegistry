DRASCO SERIES

The Drasco series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loess and material weathered from basalt. Drasco soils are on benches, canyon side slopes, and plateaus and have slopes of 3 to 35 percent. Permeability is slow. Average annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Ultic Palexerolls

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Driscoll, Nawt, Spilyay and Torney (T) series. Driscoll soils are very deep. Nawt and Torney soils have an accumulation of secondary carbonates in the lower part of the profile.  Spilyay soils are very deep and are dry 60 to 90 days in summer and early fall.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Drasco soils are on benches, canyon side slopes, and plateaus and have slopes of 3 to 35 percent. They formed in loess and material weathered from basalt. Elevations are 1,600 to 3,200 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 20 to 25 inches and the average annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  The frost free season is 90 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Kettenbach, Keuterville, Klickson, Kooskia and Taney series. Kettenbach, Keuterville, and Klickson soils have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section and are on canyon sides. Kooskia soils have albic horizons and are on plateaus. Taney soils have fine-silty particle-size control sections and are on plateaus.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; moderately rapid to rapid runoff; slow permeablilty.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mostly for pasture with some areas of hayland and woodland. Natural vegetation is Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, common snowberry, arrowleaf balsamroot, and widely spaced ponderosa pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North central Idaho.  This series is of small extent.
