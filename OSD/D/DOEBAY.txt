DOEBAY SERIES

The Doebay series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in glacial drift mixed with colluvium from bedrock of metasedimentary lithology. Doebay soils are on hillsides and mountainsides. Slopes are 5 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, isotic, mesic Humic Dystroxerepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Doebay loam, forested, on a south-facing footslope of 30 percent at 560 feet elevation. When described on November 13, 2002 the soil was moist to 5 inches and dry below. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

 A--1 to 6 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) dry; moderate medium granular structure; moderately hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots and few coarse roots; many very fine and fine irregular and tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.7); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 9 inches thick) 

 Bw1--6 to 16 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) fine sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and medium roots and few coarse roots; many very fine and fine irregular and tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 15 inches thick)

(5 to 15 inches thick) 

 C--21 to 35 inches; olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) extremely gravelly loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine interstitial and irregular pores; 65 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (10 to 25 inches thick) 

 R--35 inches; metasedimentary rock.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Billscabin, Inskip, and Turtleback series. Billscabin soils are more than 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact. Inskip soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 54 to 57 degrees F, and rock fragments are vesicular basalt from recent lava flows. Turtleback soils have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches. Series with similar classification but mixed mineralogy include the Atring, Barpeak, Beekman, Farber, Firmountain, Forgay, Geppert, Half Dome, Hartless, Hilltish, Howler, Kanid, Kindig, Mayacama, Neuns, Sheetiron, Straight, Woodin, and Vena soils. Atring, Geppert, and Straight soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Barpeak, Farber, Forgay, and Half Dome soils are very deep. Beekman, Howler, and Woodin soils have greater than 18 percent clay in the control section. Firmountain soils do not have a lithic contact because fractures are less than 4 inches apart, and have flat phyllite or schist rock fragments. Hartless, Kanid, and Kindig soils have a paralithic contact at 40 to 60 inches. Hilltish soils formed in material weathered from conglomerate and have rounded rock fragments. Mayacama, Neuns, and Sheetiron soils are dry in the soil moisture control section for more than 90 days, and are in an active cation-exchange activity class. Vena soils have acid igneous rock fragments, dominantly rhyolite. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Doebay soils occur on mountainsides and hillsides at elevations of sea level to 2,400 feet. Slopes are 5 to 75 percent. These soils formed in glacial drift mixed with colluvium from bedrock of metasedimentary lithology. The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and mild moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 40 inches. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free period is 200 to 240 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the tentative Cady, Constitution, Haro, Hiddenridge, Morancreek, and Turtleback soils. Cady soils have a lithic contact within 20 inches. Constitution soils have andic properties and the soil moisture control section is dry for 45 to 60 days. Haro soils have a lithic contact within 20 inches and a mollic epipedon. Hiddenridge soils have a mollic epipedon. Morancreek soils have a lithic contact greater than 60 inches from the soil surface. Turtleback soils have a lithic contact between 40 and 60 inches. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; permeability is moderately rapid. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for timber production, recreation, wildlife habitat, homesites, and watershed. Potential natural vegetation is an overstory of Douglas-fir, Pacific madrone, and western redcedar, with an understory of oceanspray, bald hip rose, snowberry, Oregon-grape, salal, western swordfern, and bracken fern. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwest Washington; MLRA 2. Series is of moderate extent.
