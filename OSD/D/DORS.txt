DORS SERIES



The Dors series consists of very deep, well-drained soils on fan

terraces.  They formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Permeability is

moderately rapid.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  The average annual

precipitation is about 7 inches, and the average annual temperature is

about 52 degrees F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haplocalcids

mesic, Typic Calciorthids.



TYPICAL PEDON:  Dors fine sandy loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry

soil unless otherwise noted.)



    A1--0 to 1 inch; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sandy loam,

dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak thick platy structure parting

to weak very fine granular; soft, very friable; few fine roots; few

fine vesicular pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth

boundary.  (0 to 6 inches thick)



    A2--1 to 5 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, dark

brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine platy structure; slightly hard, very

friable; few fine roots; few fine vesicular pores; strongly

effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3

to 8 inches thick)



    Bk1--5 to 20 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) fine sandy loam, dark

grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; hard, very friable; few fine

roots; few fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; mildly alkaline

(pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 18 inches thick)



    Bk2--20 to 26 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) fine sandy loam,

pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; hard, very friable; slightly

sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; few fine tubular pores;

violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt smooth

boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)



    2Bk--26 to 60 inches; variegated very gravelly sand; single grain;

loose; 40 percent pebbles and 10 percent cobbles with calcium carbonate

coatings on undersides; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH

8.4).



TYPE LOCATION:  Elmore County, Idaho, about 3-1/4 miles north of

Grandview; 1,000 feet east and 150 feet north of the southwest corner

of sec. 27, T. 4 S., R. 3 E.

2Bk horizon

Texture - GRV-LS, GRV-LCOS, GRV-S, GRV-COS

Percent pebbles - 35 to 60

Percent cobbles - 0 to 15



COMPETING SERIES:  These are the similar Cencove and Marsing series.

Cencove and Marsing soils lack a calcic horizon.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dors soils are on fan terraces at elevations of

2,300 to 3,000.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  These soils formed in

alluvium from mixed sources.  The average annual precipitation is 6 to

8 inches, and the average annual temperature is 51 to 54 degrees.  The

frost-free period is 130 to 150 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Hawsley, Mazuma,

McKeeth, Ornea, and Zerk soils.  Mazuma soils lack sand and gravel

within 40 inches.  Hawsley soils are sandy throughout.  Zerk soils have

more than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section and Ornea

soils have an argillic horizon.  McKeeth soils have an argillic horizon

and a layer of weak silica cementation.  These soils all occupy

landscape positions similar to the Dors series.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to moderately rapid

runoff; moderately rapid permeability.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Dors soils are used for rangeland.  A few areas

are irrigated.  Vegetation in the potential natural plant community is

mainly shadscale, bud sagebrush, Indian ricegrass, bottlebrush

squirreltail, and Sandberg bluegrass with scattered areas of

greasewood.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Idaho.  Dors soils are

moderately extensive.
