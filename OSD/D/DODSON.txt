DODSON SERIES

The Dodson series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy or clayey alluvium or lacustrine deposits over Permian redbeds.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on treads of high stream terraces or shoulders and summits of dissected stream terraces on alluvial plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.
