DOKER SERIES

The Doker series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  They have a volcanic ash influenced mantle over fine sandy loam.  These soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy over loamy, mixed, superactive, nonacid, frigid Typic Vitraquands

TYPICAL PEDON:  Doker ashy silt loam, in pasture (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 7 inches; black (10YR 2/1) ashy silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; common fine distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) dry redox concentrations; moderate fine and medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (7 to 14 inches thick)

    Bw--7 to 13 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) ashy silt loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) dry; common fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) dry redox concentrations; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt smooth boundary.

    Bg--13 to 15 inches; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) ashy silt loam, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) dry; many fine and medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) dry redox concentrations, many medium prominent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) and dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/6) redox concentrations in root channels; massive; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; 1/2- to 3/4-inch thick band of very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silt loam; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (Combined Bs horizon 7 to 14 inches thick)

    2Cg1--15 to 22 inches; dark gray (5Y 4/1) fine sandy loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) dry; many fine and medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redox concentrations, many medium prominent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) and dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/6) redox concentrations in root channels; massive; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 30 inches thick)

    2Cg2--22 to 38 inches; gray (5Y 5/1) fine sandy loam, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) dry; few faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redox concentrations; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 20 inches thick)

    2Cg3--38 to 60 inches; gray (5Y 5/1) fine sandy loam, light gray (5Y 7/1) dry; few faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redox concentrations; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; neutral (pH 6.8).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Doker soils are on flood plains.  Elevation is 2,950 to 3,100 feet.  Slope is 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium.  Mean annual precipitation is 14 to 19 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 105 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; slow runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for pasture, rangeland, and hayland.  The potential native vegetation is mainly tall reedgrass, mannagrass, tufted hairgrass, and sedges.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Doker soils are of small extent in western Montana.

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretation Record MT1246.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a dark colored ash influenced surface layer from the surface to 7 inches (A horizon); an ash influenced layer from 7 to 15 inches (Bw and Bg horizons); a lithologic discontinuity from 15 to 60 inches (2Cg1, 2Cg2, and 2Cg3 horizons); a particle size control section from 0 to 40 inches (A, Bw, Bg, 2Cg1, 2Cg2, and 2Cg3 horizons).  Doker soils have a frigid temperature regime and an aquic moisture regime.
