Permeability: Moderately rapid

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses: water storage and wildlife habitat.  A very small percentage of these soils have a water control system and are used for improved pasture. 
Dominant Vegetation: pond pines, southern bald cypress, water tupelo, swamp tupelo and sweetbay magnolia trees with a ground cover of sphagnum moss, water lily, golden club, yellow eyed grass, pitcher plants, sawgrass, iris, bull-tongue, arrowhead, greenbrier, ferns and other aquatic plants 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Distribution: Georgia and northern portions of Florida, possibly North Carolina and South Carolina 
Extent: Moderate 

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Lowndes County, Georgia; 1975

REMARKS: The organic matter in the Dasher series consists of moderately decomposed organic matter to depths ranging to a depth of 191 cm or more.  The 2017 version moved the type location to another site in Charlton County and the Okefenokee Swamp to better reflect the central concept of the series as well as keeping the OSD location within the Soil Survey Region where it is predominantly mapped. 


Diagnostic features recognized in this Pedon are:
Hemic--dominantly composed of hemic materials in the surface, subsurface and bottom tiers. 
Aquic conditions--periodic ponding to saturation and reduction in a zone from the soil surface to 203 centimeters (about 80 inches)
Dysic--pH in the surface, subsurface and bottom tiers to a depth of 130 to 160 cm, depending on whether fibers are derived from sphagnum moss or not, is 4.5 in 0.01M CaCL2
