DAPOIN SERIES

The Dapoin series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits derived from shale. These soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, mountain slopes, landslides, drainageways and swales. Slopes are from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 558 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 5.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Vertic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Dapoin clay loam, on a southwest facing, simple 10 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 2,475 meters (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A1--0 to 10 cm; dark brown (10YR 3/3) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 15 cm thick)

    A2--10 to 33 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (18 to 25 cm thick)

    Bw--33 to 46 cm; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (13 to 20 cm thick)

    BCk1--46 to 74 cm; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) clay, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; massive; extremely hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; finely disseminated carbonates; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.

    BCk2--74 to 81 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) paragravelly clay loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; massive; extremely hard, very firm, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; finely disseminated carbonates; 20 percent paragravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.

    BCk3--81 to 97 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) paragravelly clay, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; massive; extremely hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; finely disseminated carbonates; 25 percent paragravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.

    BCk4--97 to 112 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) clay loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; massive, extremely hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; finely disseminated carbonates; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.

    BCk5--112 to 150 cm; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) clay loam, olive (5Y 5/3) moist; massive; extremely hard, very firm, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; finely disseminated carbonates; 10 percent paragravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4). (combined thickness of BCk horizons is 90 to 117 cm or more)
