DEKAIRU SERIES

The Dekairu Series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in basaltic and andesitic volcanic ash and cinders.  The Dekairu soils are on the dissected footslopes and backslopes of large remnant caldera rims and cinder covered `a`a lava plains of stratovolcanic islands.  Slopes range from 0 to 50 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 27 degrees C. (81 degrees F.), and the mean annual precipitation is about 2032 millimeters (80 inches).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy, amorphic, isohyperthermic Humic Ustivitrands

TYPICAL PEDON: Dekairu fine sandy loam, on a west facing, 30 percent slope in an area dominated by short grasses with widely dispersed small groves of trees, at an elevation of 98 meters (320 feet).  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on June 4, 1999 the soil was moist throughout.)

4A--23 to 38 cm (9 to 15 inches); very dark brown (10YR 2/2), ashy loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; moderately smeary; 20 percent spherical 2 to 20 millimeter (.08 to 0.8 inches) very weakly cemented tuff masses; 10 percent subangular 2 to 5 millimeter (.08 to .20 inches) cinder fragments; neutral, pH 6.9 by 1:1 H2O; abrupt wavy boundary. 0 to 30 centimeters thick (0 to 12 inches)

5Bw--38 to 56 cm (15 to 22 inches); lithochromic brown (10YR 4/3), ashy loamy fine sand; weak medium subangular blocky and weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; weakly smeary; 25 percent angular very weakly cemented tuff masses; slightly alkaline, pH 7.4 by 1:1 H2O; clear wavy boundary. 15 to 38 centimeters thick (6 to 15 inches)

5BC--56 to 69 cm (22 to 27 inches); lithochromic olive brown (2.5Y 4/3), ashy loamy fine sand, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3), dry; weak medium subangular blocky and weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; 1 percent subangular 2 to 20 millimeter (.08 to .80 inches) cinder fragments; alkaline, pH 7.6 by 1:1 H2O; abrupt irregular boundary. 0 to 25 centimeters thick (0 to 10 inches)
