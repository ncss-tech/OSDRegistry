DUNKLEBER SERIES 

The Dunkleber series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in mucky peat.  These soils are in closed depressions, drainageways and floodplains. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 36 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Euic Typic Cryofibrists 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Dunkleber mucky peat, 0 to 2 percent slopes, ponded, in rangeland (colors are for wet soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi1--0 to 12 inches; black (10YR 2/1) mucky peat, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; about 80 percent fiber and raw herbaceous plant material, 70 percent rubbed; massive; nonsticky and nonplastic; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 14 inches thick) 

    Oi2--12 to 28 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) mucky peat, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; about 85 percent fiber, 80 percent rubbed; massive; nonsticky and nonplastic; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 16 inches thick) 

    Oi3--28 to 38 inches; black (10YR 2/1) mucky peat, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; about 80 percent fiber, 75 percent rubbed; massive; nonsticky and nonplastic; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 10 inches thick) 

    Oi4--38 to 44 inches; black (10YR 2/1) mucky peat, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; about 80 percent fiber, 75 percent rubbed; massive; nonsticky and nonplastic; slightly acid. (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick) 

    Oi5--44 to 60 inches; black (10YR 2/1) mucky peat, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; about 80 percent fiber, 75 percent rubbed; massive; nonsticky and nonplastic; slightly acid (pH 6.4).

COMPETING SERIES: 

There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 

Landform - closed depressions; drainageways; floodplains. 
Elevation - 4,400 to 8,800 feet. 
Slope - 0 to 2 percent. 
Parent material  organic material. 
Climate - long, cold winters; cool, moist springs; short, cool summers. 
Mean annual precipitation - 14 to 22 inches. 
Mean annual air temperature - 34 to 39 degrees F. 
Frost-free period - 30 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Foolhen and Mooseflat series. Foolhen and Mooseflat soils are mineral soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained, moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Dunkleber soils are primarily used for rangeland. The potential native vegetation is mainly sedges, rushes, willows, and shrubby cinquefoil 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Dunkleber soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.
