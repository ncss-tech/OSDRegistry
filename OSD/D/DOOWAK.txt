DOOWAK SERIES

The Doowak series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  These soils are on inset fans.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Xeric Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Doowak very gravelly loamy sand--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 15 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly loamy sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium and thick platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and few very fine roots; many very fine vesicular pores; 40 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (10 to 15 cm thick)

    Bw--15 to 46 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely gravelly sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist lithochromic colors; single grained; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and few medium roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 65 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (25 to 64 cm thick)

    Bk1--46 to 84 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely gravelly loamy sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist lithochromic colors; single grained; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 70 percent gravel; very thin carbonate coatings on undersides of gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary.  (25 to 38 cm thick)

    Bk2--84 to 122 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely gravelly loamy sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist lithochromic colors; single grained; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine, few medium roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 75 percent gravel and 2 percent cobbles; very thin carbonate coatings on undersides of rock fragments; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (25 to 38 cm thick)

    Bk3--122 to 152 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely gravelly sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist lithochromic colors; single grained; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine interstitial pores; 60 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; very thin carbonate coatings on undersides of rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Lander County, Nevada; approximately 18 miles south of Battle Mountain, about 1,000 feet north and 1,000 feet west of the southeast corner of section 9, T. 29 N., R. 44 E.; USGS McCoy NE 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 23 minutes 37 seconds N and longitude 117 degrees 1 minutes 29 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.3936111 latitude, -117.0263889 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in winter and spring, dry early June through October; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C.
Reaction:  Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  3 to 8 percent.
Rock fragments:  60 to 80 percent, mainly gravel.

A horizon
Value:  5 or 6 dry.

Bk horizon
Texture:  Stratified extremely gravelly sand to extremely gravelly loamy sand.
Effervescence:  Slightlyeffervescent through strongly effervescent.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Burbank, Crunkvar, Denio, Sheeprock, Skaha, Ulymeyer and Wrango series.  

Burbank soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 11 to 13 degrees C and lack lithocromic colors.  Crunkvar and Ulymeyer soils are noncalcareous. Denoio soils have less than 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Sheeprock soils are calcareous, have a sand fraction that is dominantly coarse and most rock fragments 0.3 to 1.2 cm in diameter.  Skaha soils are neutral and noncalcareous throughout.  Wrango soils are calcareous throughout the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Doowak soils are on inset fans.  These soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations are 1,375 to 1,830 meters.  The climate is cool semiarid with hot, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C.; and frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Oxcorel and Zineb soils.  Oxcorel soils have a clayey textured natric horizon.  Zineb soils have a cambic horizon and are loamy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Excessively drained; slow runoff; very rapid permeability; high saturated hydraulic conductivity; rare or occasionally flooded.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, spiny hopsage, Thurber needlegrass, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Nevada.  These soils are not extensive. MLRA 24.
