DOROSHIN SERIES

Depth class: very deep
Drainage class: poorly drained
Parent material: organic material overlying loamy and gravelly sediments or till
Landform depressions or fins on drainageways, outwash plains, till plains, along lake borders, and on footslopes affected by seepage
Slopes: 0 to 20 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 14 to 29 inches.
Mean annual temperature: 32 to 35 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, euic Terric Cryohemists

TYPICAL PEDON: Doroshin peat - at 350 feet elevation under bog vegetation. (All colors are for moist soil)

	Oi--0 to 14 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) peat; 90 percent fibers unrubbed, 75 percent fibers rubbed; 5 percent thin strata of mineral material; strongly acid (pH 5.2), clear smooth boundary.

	Oe1--14 to 24 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) mucky peat; 60 percent fibers unrubbed, 25 percent fibers rubbed; 5 percent thin strata of mineral material; strongly acid (pH 5.3); clear smooth boundary.

	Oe2--24 to 36 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) mucky peat; 30 percent fibers unrubbed, 25 percent fibers rubbed; 10 percent thin strata of mineral material; strongly acid (pH 5.3); abrupt smooth boundary.   (Combined thickness of the O horizons is 16 to 50 inches)

	2Cg--36 to 60 inches; dark greenish gray (5GY 4/1) silt loam; massive; friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; strongly acid (pH 5.5).

TYPE LOCATION: Anchorage Area, Alaska, about 1.2 mile west of Lower Fire Lake; in the NE1/4, SW1/4, Section 25, T.15N., R.2W., Anchorage B7SW  Seward Meridian; UTM north 6805376 and UTM east 0363161, zone 6.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth to mineral material: 16 to 50 inches
Reaction class of organic materials: 4.5 or greater (0.01M CaCl2) within some part of the control section
Strata of fibrous peat: may occur at any depth
Thin strata of mineral material: common in the organic materials
Mineral substratum: dominantly silt loam lacustrine deposits with occasional strata of volcanic ash, very fine sandy loam, sand, loamy sand, or gravel.

O horizon:
Matrix color: hue of 5YR to 10YR; value of 2 to 5; chroma of 1 to 4
Reaction class: very strongly acid or strongly acid

2C horizon:
Matrix color: hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 7; chroma of 1 to 4
Texture: is silt loam, loam, loamy sand, very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, modified by 0 to 25 percent gravel
Clay content: less than 18 percent
Reaction class: strongly acid or moderately acid

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Hewitt, Stanbro and Tepete series. Hewitt and Stanbro soils have more than 18 percent clay in the mineral underlying material. Tepete soils have continuous loose sand and gravel in the lower part of the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Depth class: very deep
Drainage class: poorly drained
Parent material: organic material overlying loamy and gravelly sediments or till
Landform depressions or fins on drainageways, outwash plains, till plains, along lake borders, and on footslopes affected by seepage
Slopes: 0 to 20 percent
Mean annual temperature: 32 to 35 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 14 to 29 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Kashwitna and Clam Gulch soils. Kashwitna soils are well drained and occur on hills and till plains. Clam Gulch soils are very poorly drained mineral soils that occur on similar landforms.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained ponded to very high runoff. The water table is at or near the surface from May through September. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the organic materials and moderately high in the mineral underlying material.

USE AND VEGETATION: The Doroshin soils are used for wildlife habitat and recreation. The native vegetation consists of mosses, sedges, willows, low-growing woody shrubs, and black spruce.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 224 Cook Inlet Lowlands, South-central Alaska. The series is extensive.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: WASILLA, ALASKA

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Kenai-Kasilof Area, Alaska, 1960.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Hemic material: 14 to 36 inches
Loamy material: 36 to 60 inches
Reaction class of the organic matter: greater than 4.5 (0.01M CaCl2) in at least part of the control section within each pedon.
The Doroshin series was originally classified as Dysic.
