DELETTE SERIES

The Delette series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium derived mainly from mixed rock sources. These soils are on fans and footslopes. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Cumulic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Delette loam, in forestland (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 Oi--0 to 1 inch; forest litter of leaves, twigs, and partly decomposed organic matter.

 A1--1 to 6 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common coarse and many very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine pores; trace angular gravel; many worm casts; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 15 inches thick)

 A2--6 to 17 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak very fine granular; hard, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common medium and coarse and many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine pores; trace angular gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); diffuse wavy boundary. (5 to 12 inches thick)

 A3--17 to 51 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak very fine granular; hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common medium and coarse and many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine pores; trace angular gravel; streaks and patches of pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) silt and fine sand; few faint brown (10YR 5/3) redox concentrations; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 35 inches thick)

 A&B--51 to 60 inches; 60 percent pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) loam A part and about 40 percent B material in pockets and thin bands of brown (7.5YR 5/2) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; weak fine or medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; faint clay films in some pores; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine pores; trace angular gravel; common faint gray (N 6/0) redox depletions; strongly acid (pH 5.4).

Everts (MN) has coarse-textured material at a depth of 40 to 55 inches.
Frolic (NM+UT WY) has a solum 20 to 50 inches thick.
La Prairie (ND+MN SD) has free carbonates below a depth of 0 to 40 inches.
Southhaven (MN) does not have an A&B horizon; is well drained.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform: Fans and footslopes
Elevation: 4,600 to 5,510 feet
Slope: 0 to 25 percent
Parent material: Alluvium and colluvium from mixed rock sources
Climate: Cool with moist springs and summers
Mean annual precipitation: 19 to 30 inches
Mean annual air temperature: 40 to 43 degrees F
Frost-free period: 80 to 110 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:

Adel (MT+CO ID NM UT WY) is well drained; has a cryic temperature regime.
Castner (MT+CO UT WY) is shallow over bedrock.
Cheadle (MT+CO UT WY) is shallow over bedrock.
Hibar (MT) is moderately deep to bedrock.
Teton (MT+UT) is moderately deep to bedrock.
Tomty (MT) has a fine control section; is somewhat poorly drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained; medium or rapid runoff; moderate permeability to about 127 cm and slow below that depth

USE AND VEGETATION: Delette soils are used mainly for woodland and rangeland. To a lesser degree, they are used for hayland. The potential native vegetation is mainly an overstory of quaking aspen and an understory of black hawthorn, common snowberry, Kentucky bluegrass, blue wildrye, timothy, white spiraea, northern bedstraw, western meadowrue, and common houndstongue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Delette soils are of limited extent in central Montana.
