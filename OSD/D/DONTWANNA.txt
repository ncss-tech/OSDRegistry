DONTWANNA SERIES 


The Dontwanna series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in predominantly volcanic alluvium derived from volcanic rock such as andesite. Dontwanna soils are on glacial outwash fan remnants. Slopes are 8 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, frigid Haplic Palexerollic Durixerolls

COMPETING SERIES: There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dontwanna soils are on glacial outwash fan remnants.  They typically occur on summit positions. They formed in predominately volcanic alluvium derived from andesite. Slopes are 8 to 30 percent. Elevations range from 1,680 to 2,134 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 400 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 10 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 70 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Crispy, Heenlake, Slinkard and Toejom soils. All of these soils lack a duripan and have less than 35 percent clay in their particle size control section. In addition Crispy soils are shallow with a paralithic contact within 50 cm. Heenlake soils have a paralithic contact between 50 to 100 cm. Slinkard soils have a mollic epipedon more than 50 cm thick. Toejom soils have a paralithic contact within 50 cm and an ochric epipedon.   

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very high surface runoff; slow permeability; low saturated hyraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Dontwanna soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is mainly mountain big sage brush, antelope bitterbrush, western and Thurber's neddlegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail and Sandberg bluegrass.   

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern California, east of the Sierra Nevada Range. These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 22.
