DALE SERIES

The Dale series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from loamy alluvium. These soils are on flood plains of minor streams in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 840 mm (33 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, thermic Pachic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Dale silt loam in a cultivated field, at an elevation of 326 m (1070 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  Ap--0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 in); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; hard, friable; many fine roots; many worm casts; noneffervescent; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. 

  A--18 to 53 cm (7 to 21 in); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and medium granular structure; hard, friable; many fine roots; many worm casts; noneffervescent; neutral; gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizon is 25 to 66 cm [10 to 26 in])

  Bw--53 to 102 cm (21 to 40 in); brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium granular; hard, friable; few fine roots; few worm casts; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (Thickness of the Bw horizon is 25 to 76 cm [10 to 30 in])

  BCk--102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 in); brown (7.5YR 5/4) silt loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; hard, friable; few fine roots; few worm casts; few films and soft masses of calcium carbonate; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline.
