DEMOTTE SERIES

The Demotte series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapid permeable soils that formed in alluvium from limestone and dolomite. Demotte soils occur on meadows, and alluvial fans. They have slopes of 0 to 8 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 32 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, semiactive, frigid Alfic Argiudolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Demotte sandy loam--meadow. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A1--0 to 3 inches (0 to 8 cm); brown (10YR 4/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3), moist; moderate platy and moderate subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots throughout, few very fine tubular pores, few fine tubular and irregular pores, 10 percent gravel; noneffervescent; abrupt smooth boundary

     A2--3 to 13 inches (8 to 33 cm); brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), moist; moderate subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots throughout, few very fine tubular pores, 15 percent gravel; noneffervescent; clear smooth boundary

     BA--13 to 24 inches (33 to 61 cm); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly loam, very dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4), moist; weak subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots throughout, common fine tubular pores, 15 percent gravel; noneffervescent; clear smooth boundary

     Bt1--24 to 36 inches (61 to 91 cm); strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) very gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4), moist; moderate subangular blocky; hard, friable, very friable, slightly sticky, moderately plastic; few very fine roots throughout, common fine tubular pores, 35 percent gravel; noneffervescent; clear smooth boundary

     Bt2--36 to 50 inches (91 to 127 cm); reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) very gravelly loam, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), moist; moderate subangular blocky; hard, friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few very fine roots throughout, common fine tubular pores, 35 percent gravel, 10 percent cobble; noneffervescent;

TYPE LOCATION: Coconino County, Arizona; located about 3.1 kilometers (1.9 miles) north of Kaibab Lodge, Arizona; USGS Quadrangle DeMotte Park; Latitude 36.44123, Longitude -112.13840, Datum WGS84.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon is 16 to 38 inches thick. The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches is 39 to 42 degrees F.  Soil moisture regime is typic udic.

A horizons:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist
Fine-earth texture: loam, sandy loam
Reaction; slightly acid to neutral

BA or Bw horizons:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 4 to 6 dry or moist
Fine-earth texture: loam
Reaction; slightly acid to neutral

Bt horizons:
Hue: 5YR or 7.5YR
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 4 to 6, dry or moist
Fine-earth texture: clay loam, clay
Reaction; slightly acid to neutral

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Demotte soils are at elevations of 8600 to 9,200 feet. They occur on meadows and alluvial fans from limestone and dolomite. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 38 to 42 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 80 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Canburn, Hikai, Veetee, and Angelbright soils. Canburn soils have aquic moisture in meadows alongside Demotte soils that lack aquic moisture.  Hikai, Veetee, and Angelbright soils are in adjacent forest.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; slow runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for recreation, pasture and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation includes mountain muhly, big wildrye, pine dropseed, sedge, and nodding bromegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Kaibab Plateau above 8700 feet in north central Arizona; MLRA 35. The series is of moderate extent.
