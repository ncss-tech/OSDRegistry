DREWING SERIES

The Drewing series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Drewing soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Argiduridic Durixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Drewing gravelly loam--forestland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 8 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/2) gravelly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak thick platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; many very fine and fine vesicular pores; 30 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 10 cm thick)

    Bt1--8 to 15 cm; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) gravelly clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; moderate very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine, medium and coarse roots; common fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 25 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 15 cm thick)

    Bt2--15 to 20 cm; light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) very gravelly sandy clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; moderate very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine, medium and coarse roots; common fine tubular pores; few distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 45 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 10 cm thick)

    Btk--20 to 28 cm; pink (7.5YR 7/4) extremely gravelly clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine, medium and coarse roots; common fine tubular pores; 65 percent gravel; common fine filaments, seams, and masses of secondary carbonates; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 10 cm thick)

    Bqk--28 to 46 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) extremely gravelly sandy loam; weak very thick platy structure in the upper 8 cm, massive below; hard, firm, brittle; few very fine roots; 60 percent gravel; secondary carbonates and silica as coats on rock fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (15 to 38 cm thick)

    Bqkm--46 to 117 cm; cemented material; alternating indurated subhorizons 5 to 10 cm thick and gravelly layers 8 to 15 cm thick; few roots in gravelly layers; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (36 to 76 cm thick)

    BCqk--117 to 152 cm; weakly cemented fine gravel; few very fine roots; few films of carbonate on gravel in the upper part.

Mollic epipedon thickness: 18 to 25 cm.
Depth to duripan: 36 to 50 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  Averages 25 to 35 percent.
Rock fragments:  35 to 60 percent.

A horizon
Hue:  10YR or 7.5YR.
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3, dry or moist.

Bt horizon
Hue: 7.5YR or 5YR.
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4, dry or moist.

Chroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist.

Rock fragments: 40 to 70 percent.

Bqk horizon - Clay content: 5 to 10 percent.
Rock fragments: 50 to 70 percent.
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  15 to 40 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ayres and Gorskel series.

Ayres soils do not have calcic horizons.  Gorskel soils have a duripan at depths of 23 to 36 cm and do not have calcic horizons or silica accumulations above the duripan.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Drewing soils are on fan remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 1,981 to 2,134 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C and the frost-free period is 90 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Jarab and Pharo soils.  Both soils lack indurated duripans.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Drewing soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is mainly singleleaf pinyon, Utah juniper, black sagebrush, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central Nevada.  These soils are not extensive with about 4,000 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 28B.
