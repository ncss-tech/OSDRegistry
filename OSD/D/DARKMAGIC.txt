DARKMAGIC SERIES

The Darkmagic series consists of moderately deep to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in loess influenced residuum weathered from basalt. The Darkmagic soils are on lava flows. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 193 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Blackmagic, Brenda, Cornville, Dona Ana, Elizario, Hap, Jagerson, Kidwell, Lanip, Madurez, Mcnew, Mohave, Nutt, Poachie and Tres Hermanos series. All competing series do not have bedrock at a depth of 50 to 100 centimeters. Blackmagic, Cornville, Dona Ana, Elizario, Madurez, Mcnew, Mohave and Poachie soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the control section. Cornville, Dona Ana, Elizario and Madurez soils have more than 50 percent sand in their control-sections. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Darkmagic soils are on lava flows. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. The soils formed in loess influenced residuum weathered from basalt. Elevation ranges from 700 to 1250 meters. The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm. The mean annual air temperature is about 16 to 20 degrees C. The frost-free period is 270 to 320 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dime and Lavatank series. Dime soils are on fan remnants, are very deep and do not have an argillic horizon. Lavatank soils are on cinder cones and "aa" lava flows, do not have an argillic or a calcic horizon, and have a cindery minerology.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: well drained; medium runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Darkmagic soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is creosote bush, Nevada ephedra, and Spanish dagger.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Basin and Range of California, U.S.A.; MLRA 30. The series is of small extent.
