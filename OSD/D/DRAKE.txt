DRAKE SERIES

The Drake series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on linear or curvilinear playa dunes. These soils formed in calcareous, loamy eolian deposits of Quaternary age. Slope ranges from 1 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 483 mm (19 in), and mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained and moderately permeable. Surface runoff is low on 1 to 5 percent slopes, medium on 5 to 20 percent slopes, and high on 20 to 30 percent slopes. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used primarily for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation includes mid and tall grasses with a lesser short grass component and a few woody plants. Forbs also occur but are not abundant. Grasses include sideoats and blue gramas, buffalograss, western wheatgrass, alkali sacaton, vine-mesquite, and small amounts of switchgrass. Other species include prairieclover, sensitivebrier, wild alfalfa, daleas, fourwing saltbrush, and cholla. Where cropped, the principal crops are cotton, grain sorghum, and wheat. This soil has been correlated to the High Lime (R077CY026TX) ecological site in MLRA-77C. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern High Plains, Southern Part (MLRA 77C in LRR H) of western Texas and eastern New Mexico. The soil is moderately extensive.
