DIAMONDHIL SERIES

The Diamondhil series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium from calcareous sandstone with some limestone and conglomerate. Diamondhil soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Argidurids

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Diamondhil soils are on fan remnants. These soils formed in mixed alluvium from mainly calcareous sandstone with some limestone and conglomerate. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent. Elevations are 3,400 to 4,400 feet. The climate is warm and arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 7 to 9 inches; mean air annual temperature is 51 to 56 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 130 to 180 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Annroma, Bludiamond and Irongold series. Annroma and Irongold soils have carbonatic mineralogy, lack argillic horizon and are shallow to a petrocalcic horizon. Bludiamond soils have a thermic temperature regime and have a petrocalcic horizon. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; high runoff; moderately slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly blackbrush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southern Nevada; MLRA 30. These soils are not extensive.
