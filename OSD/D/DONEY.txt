DONEY SERIES 

The Doney series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from semiconsolidated interbedded sandy and silty sedimentary beds.  These soils are on sedimentary plains, escarpments and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 90 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Doney loam, cultivated.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted) 

    Ap--0 to 4 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); abrupt boundary. (4 to 6 inches thick) 

    Bw--4 to 14 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots, many fine and very fine pores; few fine masses and threads of lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); gradual wavy boundary. (7 to 13 inches thick) 

    Bk--14 to 25 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; very weak coarse prismatic structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine pores; 10 percent sandstone and siltstone pebbles; few to common threads of lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary. (9 to 22 inches thick) 

    Cr--25 to 60 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 7/4) semiconsolidated interbedded sandy and silty sedimentary beds that crush to loam; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Big Horn County, Montana, 1970. 

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation records:  MT0238, MT1029, MT0740.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soils to a depth of 7 inches (after mixing) (Ap and Bw horizons); cambic horizon - the zone from 4 to 14 inches (Bw horizon); layer of carbonate accumulation - the zone from 14 to 25 inches (Bk horizon); paralithic contact - at 25 inches (Cr horizon).  The Doney soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
