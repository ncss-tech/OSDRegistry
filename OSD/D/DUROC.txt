DUROC SERIES

The Duroc series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy alluvium and eolian deposits in draws, swales, and on stream terraces in the Central High Tableland (MLRA 72). Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 41 centimeters (16 inches).  The average annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. (46 degrees F.), at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Pachic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Duroc loam, grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  A--0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 51 centimeters (4 to 20 inches) thick)

  Bw1--15 to 51 centimeters (6 to 20 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (13 to 66 centimeters (5 to 26 inches) thick)

  Bw2--51 to 71 centimeters (20 to 28 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; slightly effervescent; disseminated calcium carbonate; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 36 centimeters (0 to 14 inches) thick)

  Bk--71 to 200 centimeters (28 to 79 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; strongly effervescent; calcium carbonate occurring as soft masses and thin seams and streaks; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Goshen, Keith, Kuma and Ulysses series.
Keith and Kuma soils have an argillic horizon and are higher on the landscape.
Ulysses soils have a mollic epipedon less than 50 centimeters (20 inches) thick and are higher on the landscape.
Goshen soils have an argillic horizon and are in similar positions.
