DOMEZ SERIES

The Domez series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Domez soils are on fan skirts.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Duric Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:   Domez fine sandy loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 5 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine and common fine vesicular pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 18 cm thick)

    C1--5 to 15 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) fine sandy loam, 1 cm thick discontinuous lenses of gravelly fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 23 cm thick)

    C2--15 to 25 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) very fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate thin, medium and thick platy structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine vesicular pores; common medium and large distinct very pale brown (10YR 8/2) carbonate coats on plate surfaces, few fine distinct yellow (10YR 7/6) silica coats on gravel; violently effervescent; 10 percent gravel; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 23 cm thick)

    Cq1--25 to 41 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine vesicular pores; common medium and large distinct very pale brown (10YR 8/2) carbonate coats on durinodes and faces of peds; common thin silica films bridging sand grains; 50 percent hard and brittle cylindrical durinodes; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 25 cm thick)

    Cq2--41 to 58 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 60 percent cylindrical, hard and brittle durinodes; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth boundary.

    2C--102 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

TYPE LOCATION:  Nye County, Nevada; east of hill that juts up from valley floor and 100 feet west of State Route 89; about 0.6 mile north and 0.2 mile east of the SE corner of section 35, T.7N., R.41E.; USGS San Antonio Ranch 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 25 minutes 23 seconds N and longitude 117 degrees 19 minutes 43 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 471291.11 latitude, -117.3288889 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in some part for short periods during winter and early spring months and for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October due to convection storms; typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 15 degrees C. 
Depth to durinodes 15 to 75 cm.
Other features: Thin ash strata are in some pedons.
Effervescence: Noneffervescent through violently effervescent.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 20 to 25 percent

A horizon
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist. 
Chroma: 2 or 3.

C horizons
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y. 
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist. 
Chroma: 2 or 3.
Texture: Stratified fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay loam or clay loam; strata of loamy sand to sandy loam and up to 25 percent gravel in any 1 strata are in some pedons.  
Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline
Other features: 20 to 70 percent durinodes in a sub horizon;  20 to 40 percent discontinuous weak silica cementation is in sub horizons of some pedons.  

COMPETING SERIES:  Tere are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Domez soils are on fan skirts at elevations of 1,440 to 1,680 meters.  Slope is 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in loamy alluvium derived from many kinds of rocks dominated by basalt, rhyolite, and tuff.  The climate is warm, arid with a mean annual precipitation of 100 to 125 cm.  The mean annual temperature is 11 to 14 degrees C.  The frost free season is about 130 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Stumble and Yomba soils.  Stumble soils have sandy particle-size control sections.  Yomba soils have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing.  The vegetation is principally shadscale, bailey greasewood, kochia, and Anderson wolfberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Nevada.  These soils are of small extent. MLRA 29.
