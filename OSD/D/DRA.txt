DRA SERIES

The Dra series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in sandstone and quartzite colluvium with loess influence.  Dra soils are on mountain slopes and have slopes of 12 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 610 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3.9 degrees C.

Amelar soils have a mollic epipedon that is less than or equal to 38 cm thick and secondary carbonates from a depth of 25 to 36 cm.  Broad, Milk (T), Sheepcreek, and Small soils are moderately deep.  Custco soils have a mollic epipedon that is less than or equal to 38 cm thick and less than 27 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Drage, Remount, and Searla soils lack a calcic horizon.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon: from a depth of 4 to 45 cm
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 28 to 73 cm
Calcic horizon: from a depth of 73 to 152 cm
Particle size control section: from a depth of 28 to 73 cm
Soil temperature regime: frigid
Soil moisture regime: xeric

Typical location relocated within Teton County, ID in 2010 because the soil was not found at the old location.  This revision in 2010 also changes the classification of this series. It was formerly classified as fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Xeric Argicryolls.

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Typical pedon was not sampled.
