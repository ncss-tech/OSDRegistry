DOKIE SERIES

The Dokie series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from sandstone and quartzite rock.  Dokie soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 25 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, siliceous, superactive Ustollic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Dokie extremely bouldery loam, on a north facing, 60 percent slope in Douglas-fir woodland at an elevation of 7,800 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    The surface is covered by 40 percent boulders, 20 percent stones, 5 percent cobbles.

    Oi--0 inches to 4; forest litter of needles, twigs, leaves, and cones; slightly decomposed just above the soil surface; abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 4 inches thick)

    A--4 to 7 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 4/2) extremely bouldery loam, black (5YR 3/1) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few coarse, medium, fine and very fine roots; few medium and common fine and very fine tubular pores; 20 percent boulders, 10 percent stones, 10 percent cobbles, and 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick)

    E--7 to 16 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) extremely bouldery loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; moderate thin platy structure parting to moderate very fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine, few coarse and medium roots; common fine and very fine and few medium tubular pores; 20 percent boulders, 20 percent stones, 10 percent cobbles, and 10 percent gravel; this horizon tongues 3 to 6 inches into the horizon below; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (9 to 21 inches thick)

    Bt1--16 to 36 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) extremely stony loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine, common medium and fine, and few coarse roots; many very fine, common fine, and few medium tubular pores; few distinct clay films on faces of peds and rock fragments; 20 percent boulders, 25 percent stones, 20 percent cobbles, and 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.9); gradual wavy boundary.

    Bt2--36 to 64 inches; reddish brown (2.5YR 5/4) extremely bouldery sandy loam, reddish brown (2.5YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine and few medium roots; common fine and very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds and rock fragments; 15 percent boulders, 15 percent stones, 10 percent cobbles, and 25 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.9).

TYPE LOCATION:  Uintah County, Utah; about 1/4 mile northeast of Warren Peak; located about 1,000 feet west and 1,900 feet south of the northeast corner of sec. 18, T. 1 S., R. 24 E.; Blair Basin, Utah USGS quad; lat. 40 degrees 44 minutes 13 seconds N. and long. 109 degrees 15 minutes 37 seconds W., NAD 27

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture:  The moisture control section is affected by precipitation that falls evenly through the year with a slight increase in the late summer and early fall.  The soil moisture regime is udic bordering on ustic.
Mean annual soil temperature:  24 to 30 degrees F.

Particle-size control section:  18 to 27 percent clay and 60 to 80 percent rock fragments (predominantly stones from sandstone and quartzite lithology)

This soil has color values of 3 or less moist and 5 or less dry after mixing the top 18 cm (7 inches).

A horizon:
Value:  3 to 5 dry
Chroma:  1 or 2 dry or moist
Texture:  extremely bouldery loam or extremely stony loam
Rock fragments:  60 to 80 percent

E horizon:
Hue:  10R to 5YR
Value:  3 or 4 moist
Chroma:  3 to 5 dry or moist
Rock fragments:  60 to 80 percent

Bt horizon:
Hue:  10R to 5YR
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma:  3 to 6 dry or moist
Texture:  extremely stony loam, extremely stony sandy clay loam, or extremely bouldery sandy loam
Rock fragments:  60 to 80 percent

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Parent material:  slope alluvium and colluvium derived from sandstone and quartzite
Landform:  mountain slopes
Slopes:  25 to 70 percent
Elevation: 7,600 to 9,000 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  38 to 42 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  22 to 28 inches
Frost-free period:  50 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bigtom, Boxring, Cortyzack, Diagulch, Flynncove, and Namlot series.

Bigtom soils have mollic epipedons and are shallow.

Boxring and Flynncove soils have mollic epipedons.

Cortyzack and Diagulch soils occur on hillslopes and have fine-loamy particle-size control sections.

Namlot soils are shallow.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, high runoff, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally for woodland, rangeland, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  Potential native vegetation consists of Douglas-fir, elk sedge, mountain snowberry, Oregongrape, and birchleaf mountainmahogany.  This soil has been correlated to High Mountain Stony Loam (Douglas-fir) - 047CY512UT, and High Mountain Very Steep Stony Loam (Douglas-fir) - 047CY541UT range sites in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Utah.  LRR E, MLRA 47.  This series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Uintah County, Uintah Area Soil Survey, Utah. 1998.  The name is taken from a nearby geographic location.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section:  The zone from 16 to 36 inches.  (Bt1 horizon)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 4 to 7 inches.  (A horizon)
Argillic horizon:  The zone from 16 to 60 inches.  (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Siliceous mineralogy:  Determined from lab samples on similar geologic material and landscapes in the area.


The cation exchange activity class was inferred from laboratory data from similar soils in the Uintah Area Soil Survey.

The surface texture modifier was determined following the guidelines outlined in the Utah document, "Procedures for Distributing Rock Fragments on the Surface Layer into the Upper 6 inches of Soil and Subsequent Naming of Map Units, April 1979."

Classification changed from Mollic Cryoboralfs to Ustollic Haplocryalfs 11/98.
