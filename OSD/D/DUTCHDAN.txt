DUTCHDAN SERIES

The Dutchdan series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rock.  These soils are on mountain ridges.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 1 degree C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic Aquic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Dutchdan gravelly clay loam, in forest land (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 7 cm; slightly decomposed plant material; strongly acid (pH 5.5); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 8 centimeters thick)

    A--7 to 29 cm; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) gravelly clay loam, very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 20 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.8); gradual wavy boundary. (15 to 24 centimeters thick)

    Bt1--29 to 63 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very cobbly clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 20 percent continuous distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 20 percent gravel and 30 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.3); gradual wavy boundary. (25 to 45 centimeters thick)

    Bt2--63 to 103 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly clay, light gray (10YR 7/1) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 20 percent continuous distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 2 percent prominent strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) masses of oxidized iron in matrix; 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.9); clear wavy boundary. (30 to 60 centimeters thick)

    BCk--103 to 200 cm; light gray (5Y 7/2) gravelly clay, light gray (5Y 7/2) moist; massive; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 2 percent prominent strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) masses of oxidized iron in matrix; 10 percent calcium carbonate masses; 15 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9).

COMPETING SERIES:
Jefflake (WY) - do not have secondary calcium carbonate accumulation

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - mountain ridges
Elevation - 2560 to 2745 meters
Slope - 2 to 15 percent
Parent Material - slope alluvium derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rock
Climate - long, cold winters; cool, moist springs; short, cool summers
Mean annual precipitation - 500 to 610 mm with peak periods of precipitation occurring during the spring
Mean annual air temperature - 0.5 to 2.0 degrees C.
Frost-free period - 15 to 40 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; very slow permeability. Seasonal high water table fluctuates between a depth of 45 and 75 centimeters at some time between the months of May and July and is saturated long enough to develop redox depletions.

USE AND VEGETATION: Dutchdan soils are primarily used for forest land.  The potential native vegetation is mainly Douglas-fir, aspen, elk sedge, and pine grass.    

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Dutchdan soils are of small extent in southwestern Wyoming. MLRA - 43B.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES PROPOSED: Sublette County, Wyoming, 2011.  The series name is derived from a local landmark.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - 0 to 29 cm (Oi, A horizon)
Argillic horizon - 29 to 103 cm (Bt1, Bt2 horizons)
