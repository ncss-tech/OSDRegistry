DELTHORNY SERIES

The Delthorny series consists of very shallow and shallow to a hardpan, well drained soils formed in colluvium and mixed slope alluvium derived from basalt and conglomerate. Delthorny soils are on relict fan terraces, hills and mountains with slopes of 3 to 45 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 11 inches. The mean annual air temperature is about 68 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic Calcic Lithic Petrocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Delthorny very gravelly sandy loam - rangeland. (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 2 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak thin platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; common fine tubular pores; common distinct very pale brown (10YR 8/2) continuous calcium carbonate coatings on rock fragments; 55 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary (1 to 5 inches thick).

    Bk--2 to 9 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common fine tubular pores; many distinct very pale brown (10YR 8/2) continuous calcium carbonate coatings on rock fragments; 55 percent gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary (3 to 15 inches thick),

    2Bkm--9 to 16 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2); indurated hardpan; extremely hard (4 to 15 inches thick).

    3R--16 inches; conglomerate.

TYPE LOCATION: Pima County, Arizona; latitude of 32 degrees 12 minutes and 30 seconds North and a longitude of 112 degrees 11 minutes and 30 seconds West.  Three miles west and north of the Quijotoa Trading Post, 2,270 feet east and 2,420 feet south of the NW corner of section 17, T. 14 S., R. 2 E.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Boludo (TX) series.  Boludo soils have 20 to 35 percent clay and are in the ustic aridic soil moisture regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Delthorny soils are on relict fan terraces, hills and mountains.  Slopes range from 3 to 45 percent.  They formed in slope alluvium and colluvium from dominantly conglomerate, basalt and other igneous rock.  Elevation ranges from 2,000 to 4,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 62 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 220 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Akela, Stagecoach, Topawa, Vado and Queencreek series.  Stagecoach, Topawa, Vado and Queencrteek soils are very deep.  Akela soils do not have petrocalcic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Delthorny soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation includes creosotebush, paloverde, cacti, fluffgrass, bush muhly, ocotillo and jojoba.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Arizona.  This series is of moderate extent.  MLRA is 40.
