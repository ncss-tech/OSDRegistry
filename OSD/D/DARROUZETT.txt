DARROUZETT SERIES

The Darrouzett series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous silty and clayey loess and alluvium of Pleistocene age.  These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping loess-draped stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 508 mm (20 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).
