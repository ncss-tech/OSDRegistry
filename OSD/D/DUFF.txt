DUFF SERIES

The Duff series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Duff soils are on concave mountain side slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TYPE LOCATION: Eureka County, Nevada; approximately 11 miles east and 12 miles south of the unincorporated community of Crescent Valley, Nevada; about 500 feet south and 1,500 feet west of the northeast corner of section 36, T. 28 N., R. 49 E.; latitude 40 degrees 15 minutes 22 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 23 minutes 31 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.2561111 latitude, -116.3919444 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist late fall through early summer, dry late July through September; xeric soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 6 to 8 degrees C.
Mean summer soil temperature: 12 to 15 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 40 to 89 cm.
Depth to lithic contact: 100 to 150 cm.
Reaction:  Slightly acid through slightly alkaline.

Particle-size control section - Clay:  18 to 30 percent.
Rock fragments:  15 to 35 percent, mainly gravel.

A horizon
Hue:  10YR or 7.5YR.
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3 dry, 1 or 2 moist.
Structure:  Platy, granular or subangular blocky.

C horizon
Hue:  2.5Y or 10YR.
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4.
Texture:  Gravelly loam or gravelly clay loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Adel, Argee, Bullbasin, Hackwood, Houlhan, Lamphier, Leavittville, Lespate, Obejoyful, Osmund, Pavohroo, Rhone, Secondset, Strckland, Taterheap and Winevada series.  

Argee, Lespate, Secondset, Strickland and Winevada soils have bedrock within 100 cm. Bullbasin soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 2 to 3 degrees C. Adel, Hackwood, Houlihan, Lamphier, Leavittville, Obejoyful, Osmund, and Taterheap soils are very deep. Pavohroo soils have a cambic horizon and limestone rock fragments.  Rhone soils have a C horizon that is dominantly very channery sandy clay loam within a depth of 50 to 100 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Duff soils are on concave, north aspects of mountain side slopes.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from intrusive and extrusive volcanic rock.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 1,830 to 2,810 meters.  The climate is cold semiarid with cold, moist winters and short, warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is typically 360 to 460 mm, mainly as snow; precipitation on high peaks and ridges may be considerably higher, but is less effective due to high wind and runoff; mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 60 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bregar, Chen, and Winada soils.  Bregar and Winada are loamy-skeletal.  Chen soils are clayey-skeletal and shallow to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, mountain brome, slender wheatgrass, bearded wheatgrass, and Idaho fescue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.
