DELIGHT SERIES

The Delight series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey marine sediments overlying calcareous claystone or marl. They are on concave upland slopes on interfluves of the Cretaceous Western Gulf Coastal Plain Major Land Resource Area. Near the type location, the average annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (60 degrees F) and the average annual precipitation is 1219 to 1600 mm (48 to 63 in). Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.

C horizon (where present):
Consists of unconsolidated calcareous claystone. Most of these horizons contain seams and pockets of silty clay or clay soil material. In some pedons, this horizon may contain marl either as a primary or secondary member. 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Apperson, Brooksville, Faunsdale, Griffith and Hornbeck soils
Apperson soils are slowly permeable and formend in calcareous residuum weathered from limestone of Pennsylvanian age.
Brooksville and Faunsdale soils are somewhat poorly drained.
Griffith soils are on flood plains.
Hornbeck soils developed in Tertiary aged material.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Delight soils are on concave side slopes and toeslopes of the Cretaceous Western Coastal Plain. Slopes are commonly 3 to 8 percent, but range from 1 to 15 percent. These soils formed primarily in calcareous claystone and to a lesser degree in marl. The average annual air temperature 16 degrees C (60 degrees F)., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 1219 to 1600 mm (48 to 63 in). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Billstown, and Japany.
Billstown soils occur on adjacent sidelsopes of interfluves.
Japany soils occur on slightly lower landscapes and are somewhat poorly drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. Surface runoff is high to very high. Permeability is very slow. These soils are saturated within a depth of 1.5 to 2 feet of the surface for significant periods during winter and spring of most years. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Some areas are used for pasture. Typical vegetation in uncultivated areas is mostly native grasses and eastern red cedar. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Cretaceous Western Gulf Coastal Plain of Arkansas and possibly Oklahoma.
