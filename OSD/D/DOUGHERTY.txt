DOUGHERTY SERIES

The Dougherty series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in sandy and loamy sediments on terraces of Pleistocene age. These soils are on stabilized dunes on reworked stream terraces in the Central Red Rolling Prairies (MLRA 80A) and Northern Cross Timbers (MLRA 84A). Slopes are dominantly 0 to 8 percent, but range to 20 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 860 mm (34 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, active, thermic Arenic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Dougherty loamy fine sand-cultivated, at an elevation of 308 m (1010 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Ap--0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 in); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loamy fine sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. (Thickness of the A horizon is 0 to 23 cm [0 to 9 in])

    E--15 to 66 cm (6 to 26 in); very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; soft, very friable; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. (Thickness of the E horizon is 33 to 91 cm [13 to 36 in])

    Bt--66 to 107 cm (26 to 42 in); yellowish red (5YR 5/6) sandy clay loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; very hard, friable; few distinct clay films on faces of peds; few bridging between sand grains; moderately acid; diffuse smooth boundary. (Thickness of the Bt horizon is 25 to 64 cm [10 to 25 in])

    BC--107 to 137 cm (42 to 54 in); yellowish red (5YR 5/6) fine sandy loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; hard, friable; moderately acid; diffuse smooth boundary. (Thickness of the BC horizon is 25 to 76 cm [10 to 30 in])

    C--137 to 178 (54 to 70 in); yellowish red (5YR 5/8) loamy fine sand, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable; moderately acid.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bastrop, Derby, Eufaula, Konawa, Larton, Slaughterville, Stidham, and Teller series. 
Bastrop, Larton, and Stidham soils: are on higher terraces; in addition Bastrop soils have an argillic horizon that does not decrease by 20 percent from the maximum within a depth of 152 cm (60 in) of the surface 
Eufaula soils: are on slightly higher positions and have a sandy particle-size control section
Konawa and Teller soils: are in slightly lower positions and are on more stable landscapes; in addition, Teller soils have a mollic epipedon Konawa soils: have a fine-loamy particle-size control section and an ochric epipedon
Derby and Slaughterville soils: formed from recent eolian sediments, do not have an argillic horizon; in addition Derby soils have a sandy particle-size control section

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage: Well drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: moderately high
Runoff: negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes, very low on 1 to 5 percent slopes, and low on 5 to 20 percent slopes 

USE AND VEGETATION: Large areas are cultivated to sorghums, small grains, and peanuts. Some areas are used for improved pastures. Native vegetation is mainly post oak, blackjack, and hickory savannah with considerable understory of little bluestem, big bluestem, sand bluestem, Indiangrass, and switchgrass.
