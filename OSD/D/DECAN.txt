DECAN SERIES

Decan series consists of moderately deep over an indurated duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and mixed lacustrine deposits. Decan soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 275 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Adios, Barnard, Ollierivas, Uana and Xerta series. 

Adios, Ollierivas and Xerta soils have a lithic contact at less than 100 cm. Barnard soils contain less than 5 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section and do not receive the 10 to 20 days of summer precipitation. Uana soils have a calcium carbonate equivalent of 20 to 40 percent in the Btk horizon and are 22 to 40 cm deep to secondary calcium carbonate.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Decan soils are on fan remnants. These soils formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and mixed lacustrine deposits. Elevations are 1,650 to 2,150 meters. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. The climate is cool, semiarid. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Acoma, Cedaran, Uana and Wakansapa soils. Acoma soils have an ochric epipedon and a calcic horizon below an argillic horizon at 75 and 100 cm. Cedaran and Wakansapa soils are shallow to bedrock. Uana soils have a calcium carbonate equivalent of 20 to 40 percent in the Btk horizon and are 22 to 40 cm deep to secondary calcium carbonate.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained, slow or medium runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The potential native vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, Mountain big sagebrush, cliffrose, bottlebrush squirreltail, and Indian ricegrass. This pedon is correlated to ecological site Loamy 10-12 P.Z., R029XY029NV.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: East central Nevada. Decan soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 29 and 28A.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Lincoln County, Nevada (Meadow Valley Area), 1971.

REMARKS:  Decan was reclassified from frigid to mesic in 1990 to better represent the series concept. In 2009 the ecological site correlation was changed from a woodland potential to a rangeland potential based on soil properties. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 20 cm (A1, A2 and Bt1 horizons).
Argillic horizon - The zone from 8 to 58 cm (Bt1, Bt2, and Btk horizons).
Duripan - The zone from 58 to 88 cm (Bqkm horizon).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 8 to 58 cm (Bt1, Bt2 and Btk horizons).
