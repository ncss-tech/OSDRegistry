DEVNOT SERIES

The Devnot series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum from basalt, sandstone or conglomerate with a component of loess.  Devnot soils are on foothills.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches. The mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, smectitic, mesic Lithic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Devnot very stony clay loam - rangeland - on a 8 percent slope at 2,700 feet elevation.  Aspect is east.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on May 2, 1979, The soil was moist throughout.)

    A--0 to 4 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very stony clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak very fine and fine granular structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine pores; 10 percent gravel,10 percent cobbles, and 15 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.  (1 to 6 inches thick)

    BAt--4 to 9 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) stony clay, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; many very fine roots; few very fine pores; many prominent clay films on faces of peds; 15 percent stones, and 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick)

    Bt--9 to 19 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) stony clay, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine roots; few very fine pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent gravel and 10 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt irregular boundary.  (7 to 13 inches thick)

    R--19 inches; basalt.

TYPE LOCATION:  Washington County, Idaho; about 4 miles southwest of Paddock Reservoir about 1,500 feet east and 2,580 feet south of The northwest corner, sec. 31, T. 10 N., R. 2 W.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are Bidrim, Brezniak, Cullius, Deven, Devada, Dunnlake, and Wylo series.  Bidrim, Brezniak and Deven soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Devada soils have an abrupt A-B boundary.  Cullius soils have 10 to 30 percent glass in the surface layers.  Bidrim, Brezniak, Cullius, Devada, Dunnlake and Wylo soils have an aridic moisture regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Devnot soils are on nearly level to steep foothills at elevations of 2,300 to 4,500 feet.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in residuum from basalt with some sandstone and conglomerate a component of loess.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 to 50 degrees F.  The climate has cool, wet winters and hot, dry summers.  The frost-free season is about 80 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Ager, Bakeoven, Brownlee, Cranecreek, Deshler, Deter, Glasgow, and Reywat.  Ager, Brownlee, and Deter soils are deep.  Bakeoven soils are very shallow.  Cranecreek, Deshler, and Glasgow soils are moderately deep.  Reywat soils have over 35 percent coarse fragments.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to very rapid runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for rangeland, recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed.  Potential native vegetation is Sandberg bluegrass and stiff sagebrush.  Much of the present vegetation is cheatgrass and medusahead wildrye.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Idaho and east central Oregon.  This soil is of small extent.
