DRYCK SERIES

The Dryck series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium on floodplains stream terraces.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the upper 23 inches and very rapid below that depth.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Cumulic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Dryck very fine sandy loam in cropland on a 1 percent west facing slope at an elevation of 3620 feet.  When described on August 4, 1988 the soil was dry throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap1--0 to 3 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine and few medium and coarse roots; few fine and very fine vesicular and common very fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 7 inches thick)

    Ap2--3 to 8 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium platy structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine and medium roots; few fine and very fine vesicular and common very fine irregular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 13 inches thick)

    Bw1--8 to 11 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine and medium roots; common very fine and few fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 19 inches thick)

    Bw2--11 to 23 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine and medium roots; common fine and very fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (7 to 12 inches thick)

    2C1--23 to 28 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) fine sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine and medium roots; common very fine and few fine tubular pores;  moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 25 inches thick)

    2C2--28 to 60 inches; multi-colored sand and gravel; single grain; loose; stratified sediment ranging from 30 to 60 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9).

TYPE LOCATION:  200 feet east, 200 feet north of the southwest corner of sec. 7 T. 5 S., R. 16 E.

Thickness of mollic epipedon - 20 to 40 inches
Depth to bedrock - 60 inches or more
The soil has an aridic soil moisture regime.

Ap or A horizon

2C horizon
Value - 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma - 2 or 3 dry and moist
Texture - stratified from FS to GRX-LS
Clay content - 5 to 10 percent
Rock fragments -10 to 70 percent

Calcium carbonate - 0 to 5 percent

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Veazie and Yakima series.  Veazie soils have a xeric soil moisture regime.  Yakima soils have less than 10 percent clay in the upper part of the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dryck soils are on nearly level stream terraces at elevations of 2,700 to 4,600 feet above sea level.  They are found in alluvium and are in a climate with hot dry summers and moist cold winters.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Average annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation is 9 to 13 inches.  Average frost-free season is 70 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Quincy, Boyce, Burch, Loupence, Quencheroo, Voats and Deter soils.  None of these soils have contrasting particle size in the 20 to 40 inch zone except for Boyce. These soils occur on similar landscapes.  Boyce soils are fine-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very slow to rapid runoff; moderately rapid in the coarse-loamy material and very rapid in the underlying sand and gravel.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Principle use is for irrigated cropland where corn and potatoes are grown.  The native vegetation is bluebunch wheatgrass, basin wildrye and basin big sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South central Idaho and Central Oregon; MLRA 10 and 11.  The soils are of limited extent.
