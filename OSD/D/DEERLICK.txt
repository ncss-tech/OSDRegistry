DEERLICK SERIES

The Deerlick series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in mixed volcanic ash and alluvium overlying alluvium and glacial till.  Deerlick soils are found on slopes of 0 to 10 percent on floodplains, terraces, and alluvial fans of glaciated mountain landscapes.  The mean annual precipitation is about 2,200 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, amorphic over isotic, frigid Aquic Udivitrands

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in this family

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Deerlick soils are developed in mixed volcanic ash and alluvium overlying alluvium and glacial till on slopes of 0 to 10 percent on floodplains, terraces, and alluvial fans of glaciated mountain landscapes at elevations from 200 to 800 meters.  The climate is characterized by cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1,700 to 2,500 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 5 to 7 degrees C.  Frost-free season is 60 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Manlywham, Nohokomeen, Roland, and Skymo soils.  Manlywham soils can have redoximorphic features from endosaturation at the surface (poorly drained).  Nohokomeen and Roland soils have redoximorphic features from endosaturation below 25 cm (somewhat poorly drained).  Nohokomeen, Roland, and Skymo soils do not have contrasting particle size control sections.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained; high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Deerlick soils have a water table from endosaturation with an upper limit of 50 cm from November through May, ranging to below 150 cm from June through October.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Deerlick soils support wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed drainage.  Native vegetation includes Douglas-fir, western hemlock, western redcedar, black cottonwood, paper birch, vine maple, red huckleberry, false huckleberry, dull Oregon grape, bunchberry, twinflower, and queen's cup.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North Cascade Mountains, Washington.  MLRA 3.  Series is of small extent.
