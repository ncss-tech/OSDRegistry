DRANBURN SERIES

The Dranburn series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed alluvium and colluvium on mountains.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Dranburn soils have slopes of 15 to 45 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 20 inches.  Average annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dranburn soils are on mountain slopes at elevations of 5,400 to 7,000 feet.  They formed in mixed alluvium and colluvium derived from quartzite with some loess influence.  Slopes are 15 to 45 percent.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 22 inches.  The average annual air temperature is 37 to 41 degrees F.  The frost free period is 50 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Northwater, Robin, and Yeates Hollow soils.  Northwater soils are on steep north slopes higher on the landscape than Dranburn soils.  Northwater soils have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section.  Robin soils are on similar landscape positions as Dranburn soils.  Robin soils have a fine-silty particle-size control section and the top of the argillic horizon is deeper than 24 inches.  Yeates Hollow soils are on south and west facing slopes lower on the landscape than Dranburn soils.  Yeates Hollow soils have a clayey-skeletal particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for rangeland.  The natural vegetation is big-tooth maple, quaking aspen, and mountain brome. In some areas Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir is part of the natural vegetation.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeast Idaho.  MLRAs 13, 47. The series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Franklin County, Idaho, 1997.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon (pachic feature) - from 1 to 28 inches.  (the A1, A2, AB, and Bt1 horizons)
Argillic horizon - the zone from 22 to 48 inches.  (the Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)
Particle-size control section - the zone from 22 to 42 inches (the Bt1 and part of the Bt2 horizon)

Keys to Soil Taxonomy:  Series classified according to Eleventh Edition, 2011.  The superactive CE activity class is presumed for this series based on the general trend indicated by lab data throughout this region.

The 06/2011 revision changes the moisture regime from xeric to udic. This brings this series in line with other series in MLRA 47 that have quaking aspen ecological sites.
