DAISYPEAK SERIES 

The Daisypeak series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum or colluvium over residuum derived from calcareous sedimentary rock sources. These soils are on mountains, ridges, and structural benches.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 765 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Calcic Argicryolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Daisypeak cobbly silt loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 2 cm; forest litter, slightly decomposed. (0 to 5 cm thick)

    A--2 to 16 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) cobbly silt loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; few very fine and fine irregular pores; 20 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles and 2 percent stones; 3 percent coating of carbonates on bottoms of rock fragments; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 20 cm thick) 

    Btk--16 to 26 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) very cobbly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; few very fine and fine irregular pores; 30 percent distinct clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent gravels and 30 percent cobbles; 30 percent coating of carbonates on bottoms of rock fragments; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 30 cm thick) 

    Bk1--26 to 44 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine irregular pores; 35 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; 60 percent carbonate coating around rock fragments; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary. 

    Bk2--44 to 72 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely channery loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; very few very fine and fine roots; few fine irregular pores; 65 percent channers and 5 percent flagstones; 65 percent carbonate coating around rock fragments and 7 percent very fine threadlike masses of lime in the matrix; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of Bk horizons is 25 to 50 cm thick) 

    R--72 cm; hard fractured limestone.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Starley series.  Starley soils are on convex slope positions and are shallow or very shallow to a lithic contact and do not have an argillic horizon.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Daisypeak soils are primarily used for forestry, rangeland and wildlife habitat. The potential native range vegetation is highly dependent upon elevation and can consist of sedges, Idaho fescue, rough fescue, poverty grass, alpine bluegrass, alpine death camas, vetch, gentain and shrubby cinquefoil.  Forested areas consist of a mixed overstory of spruce, Douglas-fir, subalpine fir, lodgepole pine and whitebark pine with an understory of elk sedge, pinegrass, vetch, arnica, clematis, and cleft leaved groundsel.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Daisypeak soils are of small extent in central and southwestern Montana. MLRA 43B.
