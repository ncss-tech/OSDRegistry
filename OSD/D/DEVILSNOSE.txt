DEVILSNOSE SERIES

The Devilsnose series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in ashy colluvium over weathered colluvium and residuum from andesitic tuff breccia. The Devilsnose soils are on mountainflanks of lahars. Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1245 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family at this time. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Devilsnose soils are on middle to upper thirds ofmountainflanks) of lahars in the Central Sierra Nevada. Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. These soils formed in ashy colluvium over weathered colluvium and residuum from andesitic tuff breccia. Elevation is 900 to 1450 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 1000 to 1300 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 11 to 14 degrees C. The frost free season is 175 to 210 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
These are the Iron Mountain, Lilygap, Mantree, McCarthy and Redapple soils.  Iron Mountain soils are shallow and occur on mountaintops and steep mountainflanks. Lilygap soils are medial over loamy and occur on the lower portions of mountainflanks. Mantree soils occur on mountaintops and mountainflanks below lahars and formed in residuum from intrusive igneous rock. McCarthy soils occur in a similar landform position as Devilsnose but are moderately deep. Redapple soils occur on stable summits and backslopes of lahars and are fine.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high (lower part) to high (upper part) in the particle size control section and  moderately low above the bedrock contact. 

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Vegetation is sugar pine, ponderosa pine, white fir, incense cedar, scattered California black oak, deerbrush, whiteleaf manzanita, greenleaf manzanita, gray pinemat manzanita, and mountain misery.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. The series is not extensive.
