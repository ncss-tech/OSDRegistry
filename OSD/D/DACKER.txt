DACKER SERIES

The Dacker series consists of moderately deep over duripan, well drained soils that formed in silty alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  The Dacker soils are on fan piedmont remnants, plateaus, and partial ballenas.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Arbidge, Deerlodge, Ditchcamp, Drysel, Exel, Hager, Idow, Lojet, Rakane, Snowmore, Wako, Wellsed and Wendell soils.  

Arbidge, Deerlodge, Lojet and Welsed soils have sandy clay loam or clay loam Bt horizons.  Ditchcamp and Snowmore soils have bedrock at 61 to 100 cm. Drysel soils do not have Bqk horizons above the duripan and have soil temperature of 12 to 13 degrees C.  Exel soils have Bt horizons with hue of 7.5YR or 5YR and are slightly acid or neutral.  Hager soils have a lithic contact to tuff at 100 to 150 cm.  Idow do not have Bq horizons above the duripan and do not contain 10 percent durinodes in the Bk horizon.  Rakane soils contain loam and clay loam argillic horizon and so not have a Bqm horizon that contains 10 percent durinodes.  Wako soils do not have Bqk horizon above the duripan and have silty clay loam argillic horizon.  Wendell soils have bedrock at moderate depth.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dacker soils are on fan piedmont remnants, plateaus, fan remnants and partial ballenas.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 1,310 to 1,955 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Gance, Hunnton and Wieland soils.  Gance soils have a very gravelly clay argillic horizon.  Hunnton and Wieland soils have clay argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow or medium runoff, moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly big sagebrush, Douglas rabbitbrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, Sandberg bluegrass, Indian ricegrass and cheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeast Nevada.  MLRA 25.  The Dacker soils are not extensive.
