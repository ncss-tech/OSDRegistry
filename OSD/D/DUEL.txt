DUEL SERIES

The Duel series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in sandy drift overlying limestone bedrock on till plains and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, frigid Entic Haplorthods

TYPICAL PEDON: Duel sand, in a forested area. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 A--0 to 8 cm (3 inches); black (N 2.5/) sand, dark gray (N 4/) dry; grains of brown (7.5YR 5/2) sand; weak fine granular structure parting to single grain; loose; common very fine to coarse roots; slightly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. [0 to 10 cm (4 inches) thick]

 E--8 to 23 cm (3 to 9 inches); brown (7.5YR 5/2) loamy sand, pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) dry; single grain; loose; common very fine to coarse roots; slightly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. [5 to 30 cm (2 to 12 inches) thick]

 Bs1--23 to 53 cm (9 to 21 inches); dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) loamy sand; single grain; loose; common very fine to coarse roots; ortstein occupies about 10 percent of the horizon and is weakly cemented; ortstein occurs as discontinuous chunks; moderately acid; clear irregular boundary. [10 to 38 cm (4 to 15 inches) thick]

 Bs2--53 to 76 cm (21 to 30 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) loamy coarse sand; single grain; loose; few very fine to coarse roots; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary. [0 to 30 cm (12 inches) thick]

 2C--76 to 96 cm (30 to 38 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly very fine sandy loam; massive; firm; few very fine to coarse roots; about 35 percent gravel and 1 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. [0 to 20 cm (8 inches) thick]

 3R--96 to 122 cm (38 to 48 inches); limestone bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION: Chippewa County, Michigan; about 2 miles southwest of the village of Goetzville; 2,000 feet west and 50 feet north of the southeast corner of sec. 14, T. 42 N., R. 2 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Depth to a lithic contact: 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches)
Rock fragment content: 0 to 5 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles in the solum and C horizon; 10 to 45 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles in the 2C horizon; a few limestone flagstones or cobbles are in some pedons but typically the soil lacks stones
Particle-size control section: averages less than 35 percent rock fragments; all rock fragments are composed of limestone

A horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR, or is neutral

Reaction: strongly acid to slightly acid

Bs1 horizon:
Hue: 5YR or 7.5YR
Value: 3 or 4 
Chroma: 4
Reaction: strongly acid or moderately acid

Bs2 horizon:
Hue: 5YR or 7.5YR

C horizon, where present:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 4 to 8
Texture: sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, or coarse sand
Reaction: strongly acid to neutral

2C horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 3 to 6
Chroma: 1 to 4
Texture: loamy sand to clay loam or their gravelly or very gravelly analogues
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline; carbonates are present

COMPETING SERIES: There are the East Lake, Hartwick, Ishpeming, Karlin, Kiva, Rousseau, Rubicon, Sayner, and Sultz series. East Lake, Hartwick, Karlin, Kiva, Rousseau, Rubicon, Sayner, and Sultz soils do not have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Ishpeming soils have rock fragments composed of granite, schist, slate, and quartzite and are underlain by igneous bedrock at depths of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Duel soils are on till plains or outwash plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 12 percent. They formed in sandy drift overlying limestone bedrock. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 838 mm (27 to 33 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 5.0 to 7.2 degrees C (41 to 45 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kalkaska, Menominee, Shelter and Summerville soils on similar landscape positions. Kalkaska soils are very deep. Menominee soils are very deep and are sandy over loamy. Shelter soils are very deep and are loamy-skeletal. Summerville soils have bedrock at depths of less than 51 cm (20 inches).

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high. Permeability is rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION: Small scattered areas are used for general farming. Most of this soil is in second growth woodland. Quaking aspen, red maple, and sugar maple are the dominant tree species.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 93B, 94A, 94B, and 95A in the northeastern part of the Upper Peninsula and northeastern Wisconsin. The series is of small extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: ST. PAUL, MINNESOTA

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Arenac County, Michigan, 1964.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 23 cm (9 inches) (A and E horizons).
Albic horizon: from a depth of 8 to 23 cm (3 to 9 inches) (E horizon).
Spodic horizon: from a depth of 23 to 53 cm (9 to 21 inches) (Bs1 horizon).
Llithic contact: at 96 cm (38 inches) (top of the 3R layer).

The moderately well drained phase is no longer within the series concept.
