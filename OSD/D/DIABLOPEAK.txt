DIABLOPEAK SERIES

The Diablopeak series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in loess derived from mixed rocks over residuum derived from basalt. Diablopeak soils are on plateaus and hills. Slopes are 2 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are currently no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Diablopeak soils are on plateaus and hills. They typically occur on summit and shoulder positions. These soils formed in loess derived from mixed rocks over residuum derived from basalt. These soils occur downwind of a salty playa (Summer Lake) and frequently receive new deposits of loess high in sodium salts. Slopes are 2 to 20 percent. Elevations range from 1,435 to1,820 meters. The climate is arid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Lonegrave, Locolake, and Yankeewell soils. Lonegrave soils are loamy-skeletal, moderately deep to lithic contacts, have cambic horizons, a mesic temperature regime, and an aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric. Locolake soils are loamy and shallow to indurated duripans overlying lithic contacts. Yankeewell soils are loamy, shallow to indurated duripans overlying lithic contacts, and have an aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very high surface runoff; slow permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Diablopeak soils are used for livestock grazing. The present vegetation is shadscale, bud sagebrush, black greasewood, spiny hopsage, and Indian ricegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Oregon. These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 23.
