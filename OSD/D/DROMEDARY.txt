DROMEDARY SERIES

The Dromedary series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and till derived from sedimentary rocks.  Dromedary soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 15 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Mollic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Dromedary gravelly loam, on a north facing convex, 52 percent slope in Douglas fir at an elevation of 7600 feet.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on September 26, 1974, the soil was dry throughout.

    There are about 3 inches of leaves, twigs, and needles on the surface.

    A--0 to 6 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; 20 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.5); abrupt wavy boundary (4 to 7 inches thick). 
    
    E--6 to 22 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) very cobbly sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; many fine interstitial pores; 20 percent cobbles and 20 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); gradual wavy boundary (10 to 18 inches thick).

    Bt/E--22 to 44 inches; 60 percent Bt part is brown (10YR 4/3) very cobbly sandy clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few faint clay films on faces of peds.  40 percent E part is brown (10YR 4/3) very cobbly sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic.  Both Bt and E have few very fine, fine and medium roots; many fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary.

    Bt1--44 to 51 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) very cobbly sandy clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; moderate fine and coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; common thin clay films on faces of peds; 35 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.5); abrupt wavy boundary (5 to 15 inches thick).

    Bt2--51 to 60 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) very cobbly sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; 30 percent gravel and 25 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.5).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Guiser, Jonda, Judkins, Namon, Rocko, Tamred, Timberlin, and Wapshilla series.
Guiser:  has a Xeric moisture regime and does not have an eluvial horizon.

Judkins, Tamred, and Timberlin:  have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches
Namon:  has bedrock at 40 to over 60 inches and the upper boundary of the Bt is 24 to 40 inches.
Rocko:  has an ustic moisture regime with annual precipitation of 20 to 24 inches.
Wapshilla:  do not have eluvial horizons and formed in loess mixed with basalt alluvium.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  Colluvium and till derived from sedimentary rocks.
Landform:  Mountain slopes, dominantly north facing
Slopes:  15 to 70 percent
