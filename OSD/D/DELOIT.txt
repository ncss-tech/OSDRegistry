DELOIT SERIES

The Deloit series consists of very deep, well drained soils on foot slopes on uplands and alluvial fans. These soils formed in local loamy alluvium or colluvium derived from pre-Wisconsin glacial till. Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 74 centimeters (29 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (49 degrees F).
