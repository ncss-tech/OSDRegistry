DULUTH SERIES

The Duluth series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in a friable mantle of loamy eolian or glaciofluvial deposits and in the underlying firm loamy till on moraines and till plains.  Slopes range from 6 to 45 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 4.0 degrees C. and mean annual precipitation is about 711 millimeters.

Blackhoof--are in drainageways and depressions and have a histic epipedon but lack a glossic horizon and an argillic horizon
Culver--are on similar or less sloping positions on the landscape and are in the Oxyaquic Glossudalfs subgroup
Dusler--are at slightly lower positions, on slightly concave to slightly convex, less sloping positions on the landscape, and are in the Aquic Glossudalfs subgroup
Ellsburg--are at lower landscape positions, on flats and in drainageways, and are in the Typic Glossaqualfs subgroup

Drainage class--well drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--1.00 to 100.00 micrometers per second (moderately high or high) in the loamy mantle and 0.10 to 1.00 micrometers per second (moderately low) in the underlying till
This soil has a very transitory perched zone of saturation above the till during spring in normal years.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are forested.  Common trees are quaking aspen, paper birch, American basswood, sugar maple, northern red oak, eastern white pine, balsam fir and white spruce.  Some is used for agricultural cropland.  Hay, pasture and small grains are the most common crops.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 46 to 96 centimeters
Series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the mineral soil surface to 13 centimeters (A and E horizons);
glossic horizon--the zone from 33 to 46 centimeters (E/B horizon);
argillic horizon--the zone from 46 to 97 centimeters (2Bt1 and 2Bt2 horizons);
Udic moisture regime

This soil (along with its other hydrosequence members) was originally established on Superior lobe till of the late Wisconsinan glaciation, but now represents those soils formed in the St. Louis sub lobe of the Des Moines lobe of the late Wisconsinan glaciation. 1/18/2011-TYPE LOCATION error was corrected.
