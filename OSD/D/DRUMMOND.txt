DRUMMOND SERIES

The Drummond series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in material weathered from loamy and clayey alluvium predominantly from Permian redbeds. These soils are on flood plains in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 890 mm (35 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, thermic Mollic Natrustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Drummond loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; hard, friable; common fine roots and pores; the upper l/2 inch is vesicular and crusted; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 38 cm [3 to 15 in] thick)

    Btn--20 to 56 cm (8 to 22 in); brown (7.5YR 5/2) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; weak medium columnar structure; very hard, very firm; few fine roots and pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; few fine concretions of calcium carbonate; common fine white crystals occur below a depth of 38 cm (15 in); noneffervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (25 to 76 cm [10 to 30 in] thick)

    BC--56 to 76 cm (22 to 30 in); reddish brown (5YR 4/4) clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; very hard, very firm; few fine pores; few fine distinct strong brown redox concentrations; few fine concretions of calcium carbonate; calcareous; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (10 to 51 cm [4 to 20 in] thick)

    C--76 to 152 cm (30 to 60 in); reddish brown (5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; massive; hard, friable; thin strata of sandy loam to clay slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Huska and Pawhuska series  in the same family.
Huska soils: are 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 in) to sandstone bedrock.
Pawhuska soils: are moderately well drained and do not have an apparent water table at a depth of 2 to 6 feet.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: formed in material weathered from loamy and clayey alluvium predominantly from red Permian bedrock
Landform: flood plains in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A)
Flooding: rarely flooded
Slope: 0 to 3 percent
Mean annual temperature: 14 to 16 degrees C (58 to 60 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 810 to 1020 mm (32 to 40 in)
Thornthwaite P-E indices: 44 to 64

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Carwile, Meno, Miller, Port, Reinach, and Tabler soils.
Carwile, Meno, and Tabler soils: are on higher landscapes above the flood plain.
Miller, and Port soils: are on flood plains, but they do not have a natric horizon.
Reinach soils: are on flood plains of similar elevation, but are closer to the stream channel, do not have a natric horizon and have a coarse-silty control section.
Carwile soils: Have a mollic epipedon and wetness mottles in the lower mollic epipedon.
Meno, Port, and Reinach soils: have less than 35 percent clay in the control section.  In addition, Meno soils have an A horizon over 51 cm (20 in) thick.
