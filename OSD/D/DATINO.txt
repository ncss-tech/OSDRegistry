DATINO SERIES

The Datino series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium over residuum derived from calcareous sandstone and shale.  Datino soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 30 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 480 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4.5 degrees C.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 200 cm.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 25 to 100 cm.  (Bw and part of Bk horizons)
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 25 cm.  (A horizon)
Cambic horizon:  The zone from 25 to 41 cm.  (Bw horizon)
Calcic horizon:  The zone from 41 to 104 cm.  (Bk horizon)
Entic feature:  These soils are noneffervescent in the upper 18 to 25 cm and increase to strongly or violently effervescent in the calcic horizon.  They have free carbonates throughout the cambic horizon or in all parts of the mollic epipedon below a depth of 25 cm from the mineral soil surface.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

Taxonomic Version:  Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.

In October 2000, taxonomic classification was converted to the closest match found in Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition 1999. Some update was made to horizon nomenclature, competing series section, etc. Other placements may be more appropriate after a complete update.

In May 2008, the type location was moved to Carbon County, Utah, and the series concept was extensively revised.

These soils were formerly classified as Calcisols.
