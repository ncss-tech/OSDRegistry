DEAM SERIES

The Deam series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on hills. They formed in residuum from shale. Slopes range from 15 to 55 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 109 cm (43 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, illitic, mesic Ultic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Deam silty clay loam on a 40 percent slope in a hardwood forest at an elevation of about 192 meters (630 feet) above MSL. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated).

	A--0 to 8 cm (0 to 3 inches); 75 percent light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) and 25 percent very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay loam, pale yellow (2.5Y 7/3) and grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; friable; many very fine and fine, and common medium and coarse roots; extremely acid; clear smooth boundary. (5 to 10 cm or 2 to 4 inches thick)

	Bt1--8 to 28 cm (3 to 11 inches); light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) silty clay loam; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; firm; common very fine and fine roots, and common medium and coarse roots between peds; many distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) clay films on faces of peds; extremely acid; clear wavy boundary.

	Bt2--28 to 61 cm (11 to 24 inches); light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) silty clay; moderate fine angular blocky structure; firm; few very fine and fine, and few medium and coarse roots between peds; many distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) and very few prominent light olive gray (5Y 6/2) clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent parachanners (shale); very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of Bt horizon is 41 to 66 cm or 16 to 26 inches)

	BC--61 to 76 cm (24 to 30 inches); olive (5Y 4/3) parachannery silty clay; weak medium platy and moderate fine angular blocky structure; firm; few very fine, fine and medium roots between peds; common distinct olive gray (5Y 5/2) iron depleted coatings on faces of peds; 30 percent parachanners (shale); very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. (10 to 20 cm or 4 to 8 inches thick)

	CB--76 to 91 cm (30 to 36 inches); olive (5Y 4/3) extremely parachannery silty clay; moderate thick platy structure; firm; few very fine and fine roots between peds; common distinct olive gray (5Y 5/2) iron depleted coatings on rock fragments; 80 percent parachanners (shale); very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. (0 to 20 cm or 0 to 8 inches thick)

	Cr--91 to 152 cm (36 to 60 inches); olive (5Y 4/3) weathered shale bedrock, 1 to 2 cm (1/4 to 3/4 inches) in thickness and 5 to 25 cm (2 to 10 inches) in width; very firm; common distinct olive gray (5Y 5/2) iron depleted coatings on shale fragments; very strongly acid.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Deam soils are on backslopes of hills. They formed in residuum from shale (See Remarks). Slopes range from 15 to 55 percent. The mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (51 to 57 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 102 to 114 cm (40 to 45 inches). Frost free period is 170 to 200 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Coolville, Hickory, Rarden, and Stonehead soils. The moderately well drained Coolville, Rarden and Stonehead soils are on higher lying summits and shoulders. The very deep, well drained, more loamy Hickory soils generally are on higher lying backslopes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The potential for surface water runoff is high or very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low to moderately high (0.07 to 1.41 micrometers/s). Permeability is slow or very slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in mixed deciduous hardwood forest, the native vegetation.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Indiana. The Deam series is of small extent in MLRA 120C.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Scott County, Indiana 1995.

REMARKS: This soil has been correlated as Rockcastle and Kinderhook soils in previous soil surveys. The shale formation in Indiana is the Mississippian age New Providence; also named gray-green shale.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 1) Ochric epipedon: the zone from 0 to 8 cm (0 to 3 inches) (A horizon); 2) Argillic horizon: the zone from 8 to 61 cm (3 to 24 inches) (Bt1, Bt2 horizons); and 3) Paralithic contact: the zone where soil meets soft bedrock at 91 cm (36 inches).

A very deep phase is recognized, (Bartholomew, Co. IN). 

The representative component and horizon data is in DMU# 124, 496. 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Data for S90IN143-002 (typical pedon) and S03IN19-002 is at the National Soil Survey Lab, Lincoln, NE.
