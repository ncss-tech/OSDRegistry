DAKENT SERIES

The Dakent series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks dominantly from limestone.  They are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Durinodic Xeric Haplocalcids

(20 to 36 cm thick)

    2Bk2--109 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 65 percent gravel; violently effervescent; secondary calcium carbonate pendants on the bottom of rock fragments; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).  (38 to 50 cm thick)

TYPE LOCATION:  Mineral County, Nevada, about 1,000 feet south and 750 feet east of the northeast corner of section 24, T. 19 N., R. 32 E.; latitude 38 degrees 42 minutes 4 seconds N and longitude 118 degrees 25 minutes 43 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.7012222 latitude, -118.4286111 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, dry in summer and fall, moist in late winter and spring, and for l0 to 20 days between July and October due to convection storms; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.

Thickness of calcic horizon: 30 to 66 cm.
Reaction:  Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

Effervescence: Slightly effervescent through strongly effervescent.

Bk horizon
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.
Texture: Loam, or sandy loam.
Structure: Massive or subangular blocky.
Consistence: Soft to hard dry, very friable or friable moist.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Armespan, Automal, Morebench, Pyrat and Sugarcreek series. 

Armespan and Morbench soils have less than 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Automal and Pyrat soils lack appreciable summer moisture and Bw horizons. Sugarcreek soils are moderately deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dakent soils are on fan remnants and stable remnant side slopes.  These soils formed in alluvium from mixed rocks dominantly from limestone.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 1,740 to 1,985 meters.  The mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C, mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, and the frost-free season is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Crunker soils.  Crunker soils lack a calcic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; low to medium runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, Bailey greasewood, bud sagebrush, Indian ricegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, and galleta.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  West-central Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.
