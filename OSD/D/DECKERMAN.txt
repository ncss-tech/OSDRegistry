DECKERMAN SERIES

The Deckerman series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from sedimentary and igneous rocks.  Deckerman soils are on lake plains and flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Deckerman soils are on lake plains and flood plains.  They formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from sedimentary and igneous rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  Elevations range from 4,200 to 4,300 feet.  The climate is dry subhumid with a mean annual precipitation of 13 to 15 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 51 to 53 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is 65 to 79 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 160 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Saltair and Lasil soils.  Lasil soils are fine-silty and have natric horizons.  Saltair soils are fine-silty and have salic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; low surface runoff; moderate permeability (moderately high or high saturated hydraulic conductivity) throughout the upper 40 inches and slow permeability (moderately low or moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity) below a depth of 40 inches.  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 2 and 5 feet (moderately deep to deep free water occurrence classes) between April and September.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  One phase has been drained and reclaimed of salts and sodium.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Deckerman soils are used mostly for rangeland.  Small areas have been drained, reclaimed, and are used for irrigated cropland.  Some areas are used industrial sites and urban development.  The native vegetation in rangeland is mainly inland saltgrass, alkali sacaton, black greasewood, and basin wildrye.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Utah.  These soils are not extensive with about 8,700 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 28A.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 7 inches (Az and An horizons and part of the Bn horizon).

Cambic horizon - The zone from 6 to 12 inches (Bn horizon).

Calcic horizon - The zone from 12 to 43 inches (Bkn1, Bkn2, Bkn3, and Bkn4 horizons).

Endosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 24 and 60 inches at certain times during normal years (parts of the Bkn3, Bkn4, 2BCkn, and 2Cn horizons).

Particle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (Bkn1, Bkn2, and Bkn3 horizons and parts of the Bn and Bkn4 horizons).


This series correlates soils previously named as Decker in the Soil Survey of Salt Lake Area, Utah (UT612).

ADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has partial characterization data by the Soils Laboratory from Utah State University (USU) Logan, UT and is published on pages 120-121, Table 7 of the Soil Survey of Salt Lake Area, Utah.  The pH values in the typical pedon are from saturated paste.
