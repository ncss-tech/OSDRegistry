DOORKISS SERIES

The Doorkiss series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluviun derived from volcanic rock.  Doorkiss soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Lithic Xeric Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Doorkiss very gravelly loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The surface is covered with 1 percent stones, 15 percent cobbles and 65 percent gravel.

  A--0 to 10 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; few fine roots and few medium roots and few coarse roots and many very fine roots; many fine interstitial and many very fine interstitial pores; 1 percent stones 10 percent cobbles and 30 percent gravel; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (5 to 20 cm thick)

  Bt1--10 to 23 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/4)  very gravelly clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4), moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and plastic; common fine roots and common medium roots and common coarse roots and many very fine roots; few fine tubular and common very fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 10 percent cobbles and 40 percent gravel; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 30 cm thick)

  Bt2--23 to 38 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4)  extremely gravelly clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4), moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine roots and few medium roots and few coarse roots and many very fine roots; few fine tubular and few very fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 10 percent cobbles and 50 percent gravel; noneffervescent; neutral, pH 7.2; abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 30 cm thick)

  R--38 cm; bedrock; hard andesite bedrock, with upper 10 cm weathered and fractured; lime coats in some of the fractures.

TYPE LOCATION:  Storey County, Nevada; about 1,780 feet north and 1,440 feet east of the southwest corner of section 13, T. 19 N., R. 22 E.;  latitude 39 degrees 30 minutes 37.5 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 28 minutes 0.5 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.5104167 latitude, -119.466806  longitude..

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually moist from mid-fall through spring, dry from summer through early fall; aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 9 to 11 degrees C.
Depth to base of argillic horizon: 36 to 50 cm.
Depth to bedrock: 36 to 50 cm to a lithic contact.
Reaction: Neutral or slightly alkaline.
Other features: An abrupt textural change between the A horizon and the Bt horizon.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  Average 27 to 35 percent.
Rock fragments:  Average 50 to 70 percent, dominantly gravel.

A horizon
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3, dry or moist.

Bt horizon 
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR
Value:  4 through 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4, dry or moist.
Texture:  Clay loam or sandy clay loam.
Texture modifiers: Very gravely or extremely gravelly.
Structure:  Weak or moderate angular blocky or subangular blocky.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Atlow, Boomstick, Checkett, Chubard, Cottle, Fortyday, Gabbvally, Hooplite, Nevo, Olac, Old Camp, Phliss, Richinde, Rowel, Soughe, Stewval, and Thike series.

Atlow and Old Camp soils have thin carbonate coatings on undersides of rock fragments in the argillic horizon.  Boomstick and Phliss soils have channery rock fragments.  Checkett soils are calcareous in all parts.  Cottle soils have silica coatings on rock fragments. Fortyday, Gabbvally, Olac, Thike soils contain less than 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Chubard, Hooplite, Nevo and Rowel soils are less than 36 cm deep. Soughe soils lack an abrupt textural change between the A horizon and the Bt horizon. Richinde and Stewval soils are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative from July through September due to convection storms.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Doorkiss soils are on hills and mountains.  They typically occur on summit, shoulder, and backslope positions.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rock.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,280 to 2,440 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Ceejay, Jaybee and Ister soils soils.  Ceejay soils are clayey.  Jaybee soils are loamy. Ister soils are moderately deep.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Doorkiss soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is Lahontan sagebrush, bluegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail and Thurbers needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 27.
