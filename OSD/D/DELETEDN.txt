DELETEDN SERIES

The Deletedn series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash mixed with glacial drift and colluvium over gneiss, granite, or granodiorite bedrock. Deletedn soils are found on slopes of 0 to 15 percent on bedrock benches and valley walls of glaciated mountain landscapes.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1,900 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy, amorphic, frigid Lithic Udivitrands

TYPICAL PEDON: Deletedn cobbly ashy sandy loam, located on a south facing forested bedrock bench position with a slope of 5 percent and an elevation of 350 meters. About 20 percent of the soil surface is covered by subangular cobbles and stones. When described on June 11, 2008 the soil was moist throughout.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted)

     Oi--0 to 4 cm; slightly decomposed needles, leaves, and twigs; abrupt smooth boundary.

     Oa--4 to 6 cm; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) highly decomposed plant material, brown (7.5YR 5/2) dry; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); abrupt wavy boundary.

     Bw1--6 to 14 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/4) cobbly ashy sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine, many fine to medium, and common coarse roots; many fine to medium irregular pores; 5 percent fine gravel, 5 percent medium and coarse gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); clear wavy boundary.

     Bw2--14 to 31 cm; yellowish red (5YR 4/6) cobbly ashy sandy loam, yellowish red (5YR 5/6) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine and common fine to medium roots; many fine to medium irregular pores; 5 percent fine gravel, 5 percent medium and coarse gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; strongly acid (pH 5.5); abrupt wavy boundary.

     Bw3--31 to 45 cm; dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) cobbly ashy sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/3) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine to fine and few medium roots; common fine to medium irregular pores; 5 percent fine gravel, 5 percent medium and coarse gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; strongly acid (pH 5.5); very abrupt wavy boundary.

     R--45 cm; gneiss bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Flyvalley series. Flyvalley soils are ashy silt loam, ashy loam, or ashy very fine sandy loam in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Deletedn soils are found on slopes of 0 to 15 percent on bedrock benches and valley walls of glaciated mountain landscapes at elevations from 150 to 1000 meters.  They formed in volcanic ash mixed with glacial drift and colluvium over gneiss, granite, or granodiorite bedrock. The climate is characterized by cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1300 to 2500 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 4 to 9 degrees C.  Frost-free season is 60 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cosho, Ragged, and Tricouni soils.  Cosho soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact.  Ragged and Tricouni soils are very deep.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Deletedn soils support wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed drainage. Native vegetation consists of western hemlock, Douglas-fir, western redcedar, pachistima, Cascade Oregon grape, twinflower, western prince's-pine, kinnikinnick, rattlesnake plantain, and salal.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North Cascade Mountains, Washington.  MLRA 3.  Series is of small extent.
