DALUPE SERIES

The Dalupe series consists of deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils. The soil formed in calcareous alluvial sediments. These soils are on nearly level bottomlands. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.
 
TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Fluventic Haplustepts
 
TYPICAL PEDON: Dalupe fine sandy loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A1--0 to 10 cm (0 to 4 in), brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable; many roots, few thin strata less than 1/4 inch thick of darker colored soil; calcareous, moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (10 to 28 cm [4 to 11 in] thick)

      A2--10 to 25 cm (4 to 10 in), brown (10YR 4/3) fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; common fine roots, few thin strata of lighter colored sandy loam less than 1.3 cm (1/2 in) thick; calcareous, moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.(15 to 48 cm [6 to 19 in] thick)

     Bw--25 to 94 cm (10 to 37 in), pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky and granular structure; soft, very friable; few roots, many fine pores, common wormcasts, few thin strata of darker colored loamy soil, few films and threads of calcium carbonate on surfaces of peds; calcareous, moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (20 to 84 cm [8 to 33 in] thick)

     C--94 to 203 cm (37 to 80 in), brown (7.5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; structureless; soft, very friable; many thin strata of loam, sandy clay loam, and loamy sand materials; calcareous; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Dallam County, Texas; from the intersection of U.S. Highway 54 and U. S. Highway 87 in Dalhart; 7.6 miles northwest on U. S. Highway 87; 0.25 miles north on unpaved county road; 670 ft southeast of ranch road in cultivated field; Latitude: 36 degrees, 08 minutes, 10.38 seconds N; Longitude: 102 degrees, 37 minutes, 16.84 secondsW; Bolin NE, Texas USGS quad; NAD 83. 
 
RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: An ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.  The soil moisture control section is dry in some or all parts for more than 180 days but less than 220 days, cumulative, in normal years.  July through August and December through February are the driest months.  These soils are intermittently moist in September through November and March through June.
Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 15 degrees C (54 to 59 degrees F)
Solum thickness: more than 203 cm (80 cm)
Particle-size control section: 10 to 18 percent silicate clay.
 
A horizon: 
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value:  4 to 6 
Chroma: 2 to 4 
Texture: fine sandy loam
Effervescence: slight or strong
Reaction: moderately alkaline

Bw horizon: 
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: fine sandy loam, lenses of loam and loamy sand
Visible calcium carbonate: 0 to 5 percent by volume in the form of films and filaments
Effervescence: slight or strong 
Reaction: moderately alkaline

C horizon: 
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 or 5 
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: fine sandy loam, lenses of sandy clay loam, loam and loamy sand
Visible calcium carbonate: 0 to 5 percent by volume in the form of films and filaments
Effervescence: slight or strong
Reaction: moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: There are no series in the same family. Similar soils are the Bippus, Boerne, Cass, Corlena, Guadalupe, Hawley, Levelland, Lincoln, Munjor, Pulaski, Spur, Yahola, and Zavala series. 
Bippus, Cass and Spur soils: have a mollic epipedon.
Boerne, Guadalupe, Hawley, Levelland, Lincoln, Pulaski, Yahola, and Zavala soils: have average annual soil temperatures greater than 59 degrees F. In addition, Lincoln soils have textures of loamy fine sand or coarser in the control section
Corlena, Munjor, Pulaski, Yahola and Zavala soils: lack B horizons. In addition, Corlena soils have textures of loamy fine sand or coarser in the control section.
 
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: moderately coarse textured calcareous alluvial materials.
Landform: nearly level to very gently sloping floodplains and draws.
Slope: 0 to 1 percent.
Mean annual precipitation: 381 to 508 cm (15 to 20 in)
Mean annual air temperature: 52 to 57 degrees C (11 to 14 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 165 to 185
Elevation: 1,098 to 1,615 m (3,600 to 5,300 ft)
Thornthwaite P-E Index: 24 to 33

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Corlena, Dallam and Perico series.  
Corlena soils: are on similar landforms.
Dallam and Perico soils: have between 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are on higher landforms.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow and moderately rapid permeability.  Surface runoff is negligible on 0 to 2 percent slopes.  These soils are occasionally flooded for very brief periods.
 
USE AND VEGETATION: Used primarily for rangeland. Native vegetation consists of sideoats grama, blue grama, little bluestem, switchgrass, and western wheatgrass. A few areas
are cropped to wheat, grain sorghum and alfalfa.  This soil has been correlated to the Draw 12-17" Pz (R077BY725TX) ecological site in MLRA-77B.
 
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern High Plains, Northwestern Part (MLRA 77B in LRR H).  This series can be found along and north of the Canadian River in Northwest Texas, Northeast New Mexico and the western part of the Oklahoma Panhandle.  The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas
 
SERIES ESTABLISHED: Dallam County, Texas; 1970.
 
REMARKS: The Dalupe series formerly would have been classified in the alluvial great soil group. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in) (A1 and A2 horizons) 
Cambic horizon: 25 to 94 cm (10 to 37 in) (Bw horizon).
