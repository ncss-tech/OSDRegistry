SERIES ESTABLISHED: Hyde County, North Carolina; 1996.
REMARKS: Delway soils were previously mapped with the Delcomb series (LA). The Delcomb series was reclassified as loamy, mixed, euic, hyperthermic Terric Medisaprists.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include--
Histosols (Terric)--have organic materials that total 40 cm or more between the soil surface and a depth of 50 centimeters and total thickness of organic materials does not exceed 130 centimeters in depth - the zone from a depth of 0 to 62 cm (Oese, Oase1, Oase2).
Hemic soil materials--the zone from the soil surface to 16 centimeters (0 to 6 inches). (Oese horizon)
Sapric soil materials--the zone from 16 to 62 centimeters centimeters (6 to 24 inches). (Oase1 and Oase2 horizons)
Peraquic conditions--continuous endosaturation with very frequent tidal flooding.
Hyposulfidic soil materials--sulfurous odors and incubated pH decrease greater than 1.0 unit and remains above 4.0, the zone from the soil surface to 200 centimeters.
