DURSTON SERIES

The Durston series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and re-worked loess.  These soils are on relict stream terraces, alluvial fans, eroded fan remnants and hillslopes. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 500 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Durston silty clay loam, in hayland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 15 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine and medium roots; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 30 cm thick)

    Bt1--15 to 36 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) silty clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist, weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual smooth boundary.

    Bt2--36 to 64 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, few fine and medium roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of Bt horizons - 25 to 70 cm).

    Bk1--64 to 100 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; many medium soft masses of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual smooth boundary. (60 to 125 cm thick)

    Bk2--100 to 152 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common medium soft masses of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4).
