COMPETING SERIES: These are Madre, Satatton, and Tatton soils.
Madre soils: have more reduced hues and lower chromas, are sandier throughout, and sometimes have buried A horizons.
Satatton soils: have a SAR greater than 40, electrical conductivity values of more than 30, and often are not vegetated.
Tatton soils: have a SAR greater than 40, electrical conductivity values of more than 30, are slightly lower on the landscape, and very frequently flooded.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: Sandy lagoonal deposits
Landscape: Barrier islands and coastal plains
Landform: Low dunes, back barrier flats, and subaerial washover-fans
Slope: 0 to 1 percent
Mean annual air temperature: 21 to 23 degrees C (70 to 73 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 812 to 1194 millimeters (35 to 45 inches)
Elevation: 0 to 1.5 meters (0 to 5 feet)
Frost free period: 330 to 365 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Arrada, Galveston, and Mustang soils.
Arrada soils: are at a slightly lower elevations, have finer textures and flooded more frequently.
Galveston soils: are at slightly higher elevations/landscape positions and lack aquic moisture regime.
Mustang soils: are on similar landforms, have lower electrical conductivity readings, and have lower sodium adsorption ratios.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Special Projects Office

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Calhoun County, Texas, 1972

REMARKS:
Salinity of the soil solution expressed as dS/m ranges from 26 to 70. The SAR is more than 13, ESP more than 15 and the exchangeable Mg+Na is more than Ca+A1+H.
Dianola has a SAR of greater than 13 which changes the taxonomy from Typic Psammaquents to Sodic Psammaquents, that will compete with Madre on barrier islands of MLRA 150B.

Typical pedon taxonomic features:
Aquic conditions: 0 to 200 centimeters (Ag, Cg and C horizons)
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 10 centimeters (Ag horizon)
Salinity class: Strongly saline below 10 centimeters (Cg and C horizons)
Sodic properties: SAR greater than 13, 0 to 200 centimeters (Ag, Cg and C horizons)
Taxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 13th Edition (2022)

Additional Data:
Lincoln Lab. sample numbers 70L770-70L772 for mineralogy and partial particle size data. The morphology of the pedon represented by these samples suggest the presence of an incipient spodic horizon but the expression is too weak to qualify as Spodic Psammaquents. Also, Lincoln Lab. sample no. 73L557 or mineralogy, halic properties and particle size data.
