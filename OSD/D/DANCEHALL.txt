DANCEHALL SERIES

The Dancehall series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rock.  Dancehall soils are on valley and canyon floors, drainageways, flood plains and stream terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 35 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 5.3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid Aridic Ustifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Dancehall bouldery sandy loam, on a southwest facing, concave, 3 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 2,176 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    C4--86 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; very friable, loose, slightly sticky; few fine and very fine roots; 5 percent boulders, 5 percent cobbles and 40 percent gravel; strongly effervescent, carbonate coats on rock fragments, carbonates are finely disseminated in matrix; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Carbon County, Utah; about 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) north of the Sunnyside Mine; located about 1,800 feet south and 2,500 feet west of the northeast corner of sec. 20, T. 14 S., R. 14 E.; Patmos Head USGS quad; lat. 39 degrees 35 minutes 42 seconds N. and long. 110 degrees 22 minutes 24 seconds W., NAD 83

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competitors in this family.  Series in similar families are the Pherson, Rapidcreek and Winetti series.  Pherson soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 8.9 degrees C. to 10.5 degrees C.and an aridic moisture regime bordering on ustic.  Rapidcreek soils have an ustic moisture regime bordering on udic.  Winetti soils have a typic ustic soil moisture regime.   

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  alluvium derived from sedimentary rock, dominantly calcareous sandstone and shale
Landform:  Canyon and valley floors, drainageways, flood plains, stream terraces 
Slopes:  1 to 8 percent
Elevation:  1,950 to 2,316 meters
Mean annual temperature:  3.3 to 7.2 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation:  30 to 41 cm
Precipitation pattern:  Peaks from July to October and falls evenly throughout the remainder of the year
Frost-free period:  80 to 120 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Neto, Podo, Rabbitex and Shupert series.  The Neto soils occur in drainageways at higher elevations and have a typic ustic moisture regime.  The shallow Podo soils are on canyon walls and mountainsides under pinyon and Utah juniper.  Rabbitex soils have a mollic epipedon and a calcic horizon and are on mountain toeslopes and fans under Wyoming big sagebrush.  The Shupert soils are fine-loamy and are on stream terraces on slightly higher elevations under basin big sagebrush.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  well, low to medium runoff, moderate or moderately rapid permeability, rarely flooded for brief periods during the months of March to October from snowmelt and summer thunderstorms.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Grazing and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation consists of Great Basin wildrye, basin big sagebrush, rubber rabbitbrush, fourwing saltbush, muttongrass, western wheatgrass, needleandthread, Indian ricegrass, and pepperweed.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern and central Utah mountains, Warm Central Desertic Basins, Mountains and Plateaus; LRR D, MLRA 34B; small extent.  About 4,000 acres (1,600 hectares) in Carbon, Emery, and Sevier Counties, Utah.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Carbon County, Utah, Carbon Area, Utah, Parts of Carbon and Emery Counties soil survey area, 2011.  The name is that of a spring in upper Whitmore Canyon near the type location.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 200 cm.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 25 to 102 cm.  (parts of the C horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 15 cm.  (A horizon)
Fluvent feature:  Irregular decrease of organic carbon from a depth of 25 to 125 cm; or at least 0.2 percent organic carbon of Holocene age at a depth of 125 cm below the soil surface

The type location was previously classified as the Winetti series in the Carbon Area soil survey.  

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
