DRAKCE SERIES

The Drakce series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from basalt and tuff.  Drakce soils are on escarpments on plateaus.  Slopes are 15 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, mesic Pachic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Drakce very stony loam--on a 30 percent slope at an elevation of 4,700 feet--forestland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. The soil was dry to 14 inches and slightly moist below 14 inches when it was described on September 2, 1998.)  About 2 percent of the soil surface is covered with basalt stones.

(10 to 24 inches thick)

    2R--44 inches; basalt.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Dosie, Gurdane, Kishwalk, Mallory, Tablerock, and Thiessen series.

Dosie soils have an aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric.  Gurdane, Kishwalk, Mallory, and Thiessen soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Tablerock soils are very deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Drakce soils are on escarpments on plateaus.  These soils formed in colluvium derived from basalt and tuff.  Slopes are 15 to 65 percent.  Elevations range from 4,400 to 5,300 feet. The climate is characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F., mean January temperature is 27 to 30 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is 58 to 62 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Casebeer, Dranket, Norcross, and Schnipps soils.  Casebeer and Norcross soils are clayey, shallow to duripans over bedrock, and have argillic horizons.  Dranket soils are fine, moderately deep to duripans over bedrock, and have argillic horizons.  Schnipps soils are fine, deep to paralithic contacts, and have a frigid temperature regime.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very high surface runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Drakce soils are used for livestock grazing, wood production, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  The native vegetation is a forest canopy of western juniper with an understory of Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, and mountain big sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Oregon.  These soils are not extensive. MLRA 21.
