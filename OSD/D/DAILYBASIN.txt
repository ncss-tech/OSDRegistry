DAILYBASIN SERIES

The Dailybasin series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, or till from sedimentary and igneous rock sources. Dailybasin soils are on mountain slopes, foothills, moraines, landslides, alluvial fans, outwash fans, and stream terraces. Permeability is moderate. Slopes range from 2 to 45 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the average annual temperature is about 38 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Pachic Argicryolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Dailybasin very cobbly loam, in rangeland on a north-east facing slope of 25 percent at 7,540 feet elevation. (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise stated. When described on July 1, 1999 the soil was dry throughout).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Adel and Libeg series. Adel soils are pachic, fine loamy and are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, hills, drainageways and swales.  Libeg soils have mollic epipedons that are 4 to 15 inches thick and are on mountains, alluvial fans, stream terraces, alpine moraines, hills, escarpments, outwash plains, avalanche chutes, and landslides.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Dailybasin soils are used mainly for rangeland.  Dominant natural vegetation is Richardsons needlegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, Columbia needlegrass, Idaho fescue, forms and shrubs with some areas having basin wildrye and big sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Dailybasin soils are of small extent in south western Montana. MLRA 43B.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana 

SERIES PROPOSED: Park County, Montana, 2005. Dailybasin soils are named after a nearby geographical feature on the Dome Mountain Quadrangle.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon:
