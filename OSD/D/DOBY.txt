DOBY SERIES

The Doby series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in material derived from semiconsolidated shale. These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, smectitic, shallow Ustic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Doby clay loam - native grass. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 2 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine roots; 20 percent soft shale fragments; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary.

    A2--2 to 5 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) clay, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine roots; 20 percent soft shale fragments; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of A horizon is 4 to 7 inches)

    Bw--5 to 13 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) clay, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and fine subangular blocky; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and very plastic; many very fine roots; 20 percent soft shale fragments; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear irregular boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick)

    C--13 to 19 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) shaly clay, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; thick platy structure; extremely hard, extremely firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine roots in fractures and cleavage planes; 60 percent shale; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick)

    Cr--19 to 60 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) semiconsolidated shale, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Glacier County (Blackfeet Reservation-Cut Bank Area), Montana, 1969.

Remarks: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: a mollic epipedon from the surface to 13 inches (A1, A2 and Bw horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 19 inches (Bw and C horizons); a paralithic contact at 19 inches (Cr horizon). Doby soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
