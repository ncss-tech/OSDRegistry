DOAKUM SERIES

The Doakum series consists of deep and very deep, well drained moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium, fan alluvium, stream alluvium and eolian materials derived dominantly from shale and sandstone. Doakum soils are on mesas, plateaus, cuestas, fan remnants, fan terraces, hills and ridges. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Doakum soils are on mesas, cuestas, fan remnants, fan terraces and plateaus. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. The soils formed in alluvium, fan alluvium, stream alluvium and eolian material derived dominantly from shale and sandstone. Elevations range from 6,000 to 7,200 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 14 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 46 to 53 degrees F. The frost-free period is 100 to 150 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low to medium runoff; moderate permeability

USE AND VEGETATION: Doakum soils are used for livestock grazing, urban development and irrigated cropland. Present vegetation is galleta, blue grama, Wyoming big sagebrush and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern New Mexico and northeastern Arizona. MLRA 35 & 36, LRR-D.  This series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Sandoval County, New Mexico, 1987.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon: The zone from 0 to 5 inches (A horizon)

Argillic horizon: The zone from 5 to 17 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizons)

Classified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006

The Doakum and Penistaja series were originally classified in Ustalfic and Ustollic subgroups, respectively.  A later revision to Soil Taxonomy combined these into one Ustic subgroup resulting in duplication of series differentia and inconsistent field mapping.  Surface organic matter content has been better defined as differentia but the Doakum series may need to be inactivated if concept confusion persists after 7/2007
