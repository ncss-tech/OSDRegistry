Mean Annual Air Temperature:  57 degrees F. (14 degrees C)
Mean Annual Water Temperature:  57 degrees F. (14 degrees C)
Bathymetry:  0 to 2.5 meters below men sea level 
Water Regime:  Tidal, 0 to 1 foot (0 to 0.3 meters) tidal range
Water Salinity Range:  7 to 15 ppt

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
Rhode River soils- These soils have a coarse-loamy particle size class and have a lithologic discontinuity contact with buried pre-Holocene upland soil materials.  
Sand Point soils- These soils are not sandy throughout the upper 100 centimeters and contain sulfidic materials within 10 centimeters of the soil surface. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage Class:  Subaqueous and peraquic soil moisture regime
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity:  Moderately high to high and low to very low in the lithologic discontinuity
Soil is permanently submerged / continuously inundated with brackish water.  These soils have potential to have sulfidic materials within the soil profile putting these soils at risk for potential acid sulfate soil formation if they are dredged and exposed to the air.  

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Major Uses:  Areas of this soil are used for recreational fishing, swimming, boating, and dock and marina construction. Commercial uses include shell fishing and aquaculture. Benthic fauna such as clams, blue crabs, and oysters are associated with this soil. Eelgrass (Zostera marina), sea lettuce (Ulva sp.), and horned pondweed (Zannichellia palustris) may occur on these soils.
