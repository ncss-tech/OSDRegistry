DRYDEN SERIES

The Dryden series is very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in sandy loam till on moraines and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, semiactive, mesic Oxyaquic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Dryden sandy loam, in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 20 cm (8 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine roots; 1 percent rock fragments; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 inches) thick]

 Bw--20 to 36 cm (8 to 14 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; 2 percent rock fragments; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. [8 to 15 cm (3 to 6 inches) thick]

 Bt1--36 to 61 cm (14 to 24 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) loam; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; few thin dark brown (10YR 3/3) clay films; few fine roots; 2 percent rock fragments; neutral; gradual wavy boundary. [15 to 38 cm (6 to 15 inches) thick]

 Bt2--61 to 76 cm (24 to 30 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; few thin dark brown (10YR 3/3) clay films on vertical and horizontal faces of peds; few fine roots; common fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; common fine faint grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions; 2 percent rock fragments; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary. [13 to 41 cm (5 to 16 inches) thick]

 C--76 to 152 cm (30 to 60 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam; massive; friable; common fine and medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron and faint brown (10YR 4/3) masses of manganese; common fine and medium faint light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) iron depletions; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Elmdale and Perrin series. Elmdale soils are deeper than 102 cm (40 inches) to carbonates. Perrin soils have dominant textures of sand in the fine earth fraction within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dryden soils are on till plains and low moraines of Wisconsinan age. The dominant slope gradients are between 0 and 6 percent and the full range is from 0 to about 10 percent. The Dryden soils formed in sandy loam till. The climate is continental. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 750 to 925 mm (29 to 37 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.0 to 10 degrees C (45 to 50 degrees C). Mean summer temperature is about 21.1 degrees C (70 degrees F) near the type location.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The poorly drained Barry soils, well drained Lapeer soils, and somewhat poorly drained Locke soils are closely associated in a drainage sequence. The well drained Spinks soils are on nearby slightly higher elevations. The very poorly drained or poorly drained Gilford and Mussey soils and the somewhat poorly drained Wasepi soils are in associated small drainageways in a few places. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium, depending upon slope gradient. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. Corn, beans, small grain, and legume-grass hay are the principal crops. A smaller part is in permanent pasture or forest. Native vegetation is chiefly sugar maple, beech, oaks, and hickory.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 98 in southern Michigan. The series is of small extent.
