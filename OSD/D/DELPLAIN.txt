DELPLAIN SERIES 

The Delplain series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum or colluvium derived from hard shale and sandstone.  These soils are on sedimentary plains, dipslopes and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, nonacid, frigid Aridic Lithic Ustorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Delplain channery clay loam, rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

	A--0 to 4 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) channery clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, friable, sticky and plastic; many fine and very fine roots; 20 percent channers; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick) 

	C1--4 to 8 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) extremely channery clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many fine and very fine roots; 70 percent channers; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 8 inches thick) 

	C2--8 to 18 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) extremely channery clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common fine and very fine roots; 80 percent channers; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual boundary.  (5 to 12 inches thick) 

	R--18 inches; hard shale and fine grained sandstone.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 

Landform - sedimentary plains, dipslopes and hills. 

Elevation - 3,000 to 4,200 feet. 

Slope - 2 to 60 percent. 

Parent material - residuum or colluvium derived from hard shale and sandstone. 

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers. 

Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 14 inches. 

Mean annual air temperature - 42 to 45 degrees F. 

Frost-free period - 105 to 135 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderately slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Delplain soils are used mainly for rangeland. Potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, green needlegrass, little bluestem, and shrubs.  A few ponderosa pine trees occur along some bench edges. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Delplain soils are moderately extensive in central Montana.
