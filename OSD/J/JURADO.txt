JURADO SERIES

The Jurado series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from quartzite. Jurado soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C.

(13 to 18 cm thick)

    Btk1--30 to 66 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely gravelly sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; common secondary calcium carbonate masses on the bottom of rock fragments; few faint clay films on ped faces; 55 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); gradual smooth boundary. (10 to 36 cm thick)

    Btk2--66 to 109 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) moist; moderate medium and coarse angular blocky structure; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; many secondary calcium carbonate masses around rock fragments and on faces of peds; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and bridging sand grains; 55 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (36 to 43 cm thick)

    2Bk--109 to 152 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) extremely cobbly sandy loam, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; secondary calcium carbonate masses around rock fragments; 35 percent gravel and 50 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5).

TYPE LOCATION: White Pine County, Nevada; 3 miles north of Baker, Nevada, 40 yards west of Highway 487; about 1600 feet south and 2300 feet west of the northeast corner of section 5, T. 13 N., R. 70 E.; USGS Lehman Caves 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 01 minutes 53 seconds N and longitude 114 degrees 08 minutes 27 seconds W; NAD 83.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Fireball, Minnye, Perazzo, Preatorson, Rednik, Stonell and Zaba series.  

Fireball soils are deep to bedrock and have an exchangeable sodium percentage that is greater than 15.  Minnye soils do not have rock fragments with quartzite lithology and are 25 to 60 cm to the base of the argillic horizon.  Perazzo soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Preatorson soils lack a Bk above the argillic horizon.  Rednik and Zaba soils have an exchangeable sodium percentage that is greater than 15.  Stonell soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Jurado soils are on fan remnants. These soils formed from alluvium derived mainly from quartzite. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,620 to 2,045 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 14 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Badena, Gravier, Summermute and Sycomat soils. Badena soils have a mollic epipedon. Gravier soils have a calcic horizon and do not have an argillic horizon. Summermute and Sycomat soils have calcic horizons and durinodes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained, medium runoff, moderate high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Jurado soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The potential vegetation is mainly shadscale, bud sagebrush, Indian ricegrass, and galleta.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28A.
