JOHNSON SERIES

The Johnson series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess over material weathered from granitic or metamorphic rocks. Johnson soils are on canyon breaks, structural benches, plateaus, mountains, and hills and have slopes of 5 to 75 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 600 mm and the average annual air temperature is about 7.2 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Ultic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Johnson loam, on a 37 percent east-facing slope at 1189 meters elevation in forest. When described on May 8, 1974, the soil was moist throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--3 to 8 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many fine irregular pores; moderately acid (pH 5.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 10 cm thick)

    A2--8 to 20 cm; dark brown (10YR 3/3) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many fine irregular pores; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual smooth boundary. (8 to 20 cm thick)

(20 to 38 cm thick)

    Bt2--102 to 142 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and coarse roots; common fine tubular pores; few distinct clay films; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual smooth boundary. (25 to 51 cm thick)

    Bt3--142 to 168 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/4) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; common fine tubular pores; few faint clay films; neutral (pH 6.6).
