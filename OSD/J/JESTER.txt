JESTER SERIES

The Jester series consist of very deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in sandy eolian Holocene sediments. These very gently sloping to steep soils are on undulating to steep dunes adjacent to flood plains of major streams and drainageways in the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78B, 78C) and Southern High Plains Breaks (MLRA 77E). Low areas of this soil are subject to rare flooding. Slope ranges from 1 to 45 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 14 degrees C (57 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 660 mm (26 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, thermic Typic Ustipsamments 

TYPICAL PEDON: Jester fine sand, rangeland, at an elevation of 608 m (1995 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.) 

    A--0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in) brown (10YR 5/3) fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grain; soft, very friable; many fine, few medium and coarse roots; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary. (Thickness of the A horizon is 10 to 30 cm [4 to 12 in]) 

    C1--20 to 69 cm (8 to 27 in) light brown (7.5YR 6/4) fine sand, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; single grain; loose; few fine roots; faint cross bedding is present; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. 

    C2--69 to 203 cm (27 to 80 in) pink (7.5YR 7/4) fine sand, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist; single grain; loose; few fine roots; faint cross bedding is present; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline. (Combined thickness of the C horizon is 0 to 71 cm [0 to 28 in])

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Goodnight (OK), Southside (OK), and Tivoli (OK) series and the similar Milsand (NM), Likes (TX), and Nutivoli (TX) series. 
Goodnight soils: occur in more moist climates 
Likes, Milsand and Nutivoli soils: occur in drier climates 
Southside soils: occur on higher positions near rivers and large streams, and have gravelly textures
Tivoli soils: are on uplands, are in a dryer climate, and are noncalcareous in the control section 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: sandy calcareous eolian sediments of Holocene age
Landscape: alluvial plains
Landform: long narrow undulating to hummocky dunes 
Slope: 1 to 45 percent
Mean annual air temperature: 13 to 16 degrees C (55 to 61 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 533 to 710 mm (21 to 28 in)
Frost-free period:  185 to 230 days
Elevation:  456 to 760 m (1,500 to 2,500 ft)
Thornthwaite Annual P-E indices: 32 to 44

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Tivoli (OK) series of the same family and the Daycreek (OK), Devol (OK), Ezell (OK), Gracemore (OK), Gracemont (OK), Hardeman (TX), Lincoln (OK), and Westola (OK) series. Daycreek soils: are on similar positions and have a water table within 152 cm (60 in) of the surface 
Devol and Hardeman soils: have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections and are on higher positions 
Ezell, Gracemore, Gracemont, Lincoln, and Westola soils: are on surrounding or adjacent flood plains; in addition Ezell soils pond water for extended periods of time. Gracemore and Gracemont soils have a water table near the surface most of the year. Gracemore and Lincoln soils are loamy fine sand or coarser in the textural control section; and Gracemont and Westola soils are coarse-loamy in the textural control section. 
Tivoli soils: are on higher positions and are not calcareous in the control section 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage class: excessively drained
Permeability: rapid
Runoff: negligible on slopes less than 5 percent, very low on 5 to 20 percent slopes and low on 20 to 45 percent slopes. 
Flooding: low areas of this soil are subject to rare flooding. Most areas of this soil are surrounded by, or are adjacent to occasionally flooded soils.
Depth to an apparent water table: 1.8 to 6 m (6 to 20 ft), from January through December. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Jester soils are used mainly for grazing. Native vegetation is tall grasses with a small percentage of Cottonwood, Hackberry, and plum trees. Some areas have been planted to improved bermudagrass or Weeping lovegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: LRR-H Central Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range
Region; Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78B, 78C) and Southern High Plains Breaks (MLRA 77E) of Oklahoma, Texas, and Kansas. The soil is of minor extent.
