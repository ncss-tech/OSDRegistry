JAYTHREE SERIES

The Jaythree series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from arkosic sandstone and shale.   Jaythree soils are in valleys and drainageways.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jaythree sandy loam, on an east facing, concave, 5 percent slope in ponderosa pine woodland at an elevation of 7,540 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on October 15, 1992, the soil was moist from 2 to 40 inches.

    Oi--0 to 0.5 inch, slightly decomposed needle litter.

    A--0.5 to 2 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick)

    AB--2 to 12 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, few medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of ped ; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.

(6 to 13 inches thick)

    Bt2--24 to 40 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) sandy clay loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; weak, fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; common thin clay films on faces of ped ; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (7 to 25 inches thick)

    C--40 to 80 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) sandy clay loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and medium roots; few very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.

TYPE LOCATION:  Rio Arriba County, New Mexico; about 10 miles west of Heron Reservoir; located about 2500 feet west and 500 feet north of the southeast corner of sec. 27, T. 29 N., R. 1 W.; Cedar Canyon USGS quad; lat. 36 degrees 41 minutes 30 seconds N. and long. 106 degrees 55 minutes 15 seconds W., NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: (depths given are measure from the mineral soil surface)
Soil moisture:  The soil moisture control section is affected by precipitation that is evenly distributed throughout the year with the exception of a significant peak during July and August, and a significant decrease from April through June.  June is the driest month. (Typic Ustic moisture regime.)
Mean annual soil temperature:  42 to 45 degrees F
Mean summer soil temperature:  51 to 54 degrees F
Thickness of the mollic epipedon: 20 to 40 inches

Particle-size control section (weighted average):  
Clay content:  20 to 35 percent
Sand content:  40 to 70 percent

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bowbells, Brycan, Carfall, Center Creek, Chugcreek, Detra, Fiesta, Flaxton, Hereford, Hesperus, Laceycreek, Ohwiler, Pachel, Peta, Schauson, Todacheene, Trag, and Weed series.  
Bowbells, Brycan, Hereford, Pachel, and Weed soils have accumulations of secondary calcium carbonate.
Carfall, Flaxton, Laceycreek, and Peta soils have peak moisture in the moisture control section in spring and early summer.
Center Creek soils have a very gravelly lithologic discontinuity below the argillic.
Chugcreek, Detra, and Trag soils have a lithic contact within 60 inches.
Fiesta soils have rock fragments derived from metamorphic rock.
Hesperus soils have redox concentrations.
Ohwiler soils have less than 35 percent fine and coarser sands.
Schauson and Todacheene soils have rock fragments derived from basic igneous rocks.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  alluvium derived from arkosic sandstone and shale.
Landform:  valleys and drainageways
Slopes:  1 to 15 percent
Elevation:  7,000 to 7,800 feet
Mean annual temperature:  42 to 45 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation:  16 to 20 inches
Precipitation pattern: Precipitation falls mostly during the months of November through March and July through October.  June is the driest month.  Total snowfall averages about 4 to 5 feet with snowmelt lasting into April.
Frost-free period:  80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ishkoten, Jicarilla, and Losindios soils.  The Ishkoten soils are moderately deep and are on backslopes.  The Jicarilla soils have redox depletions and are on lower valley slopes.  The Losindios soils do not have a mollic epipedon and are on similar positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:   Well drained, medium runoff,  moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major uses are commercial timber and wildlife habitat.   The native plant community is  ponderosa pine,  Gambel's oak, Arizona fescue, and western wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern New Mexico;  MLRA 48A; minor extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, Jicarilla Apache Area, Parts of Rio Arriba and Sandoval Counties Soil Survey.  The name Jaythree is coined from the local road naming system.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 12 to 32 inches.  (Bt1, Bt2 horizons)
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 1/2 to 24 inches.  (A, AB, Bt1 horizons)
Argillic horizon:  The zone from 12 to 40 inches.  (Bt1, Bt2 horizons)
Other features:  profiles are noncalcareous to a depth of 60 inches or more.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

Taxonomic Version:  Second Edition, 1999

ADDITIONAL DATA: Particle size, pH, and organic matter reference samples have been run at local labs.
