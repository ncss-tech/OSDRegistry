JUNG SERIES

The Jung series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum from metavolcanic and volcanic rocks. Jung soils are on mountains and hill crests and side slopes. Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, mesic Lithic Xeric Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Jung very cobbly loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The surface soil is covered by 20 percent gravel and 25 percent cobbles.

    A1--0 to 8 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very cobbly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak thin platy structure parting to weak very fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; many fine vesicular pores; 25 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 8 cm thick)

    A2--8 to 20 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) cobbly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak thin platy structure parting to weak very fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 15 cm thick)

    Bt--20 to 38 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and fine subangular blocky; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; continuous thick clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary. (13 to 20 cm thick)

    Btk--38 to 48 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very cobbly clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; thin patchy clay films on faces of peds; 30 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; lime coats on undersides of rock fragments; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt irregular boundary.  (8 to 13 cm thick)

    R--48 cm; fractured hard rhyolite; fractures more than 10 cm apart.

TYPE LOCATION: Lander County, Nevada; in cut at side of power-line access road, approximately 17.5 miles west of Austin near Mount Airy, about 50 feet south and 1,300 feet west of the northeast corner of section 5, T. 19 N., R. 41 E. USGS Mount Airy, NV 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 32 minutes 54 seconds N and longitude 117 degrees 22 minutes 52 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.5486111 latitude, -117.382778 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist winter and spring, dry mid-June through early November; aridic moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C.
Depth to bedrock: 36 to 50 cm.

Particle-size control section  - Clay content: 35 to 45 percent.
Rock fragments: 35 to 50 percent, mainly gravel and cobbles.

A horizon
Value: 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3.
Reaction: Neutral or slightly alkaline.

Bt horizon
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR.
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma: 3 or 4.
Texture: Very gravelly clay loam, very cobbly clay loam, and very cobbly clay.
Structure: Subangular blocky, prismatic or angular blocky structure.
Reaction: Moderate alkaline or strongly alkaline.
Consistence: Hard to very hard, friable to firm.

Btk horizon 
Effervescence: Slightly effervescent or strongly effervescent.
Consistence: Slightly hard to hard, very friable to firm, slightly sticky to sticky, slightly plastic to plastic.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Burrita, Disage, Grumblen, Loomis, and Rocconda series. 

Burrita soils lack Btk horizons with secondary carbonates and an effervescent matrix. Disage soils do not have Btk horizons and have neutral argillic horizons. Grumblen soils have soil temperature that ranges from 12 to 13 degrees C. and have more than 15 percent increase in clay in the Bt horizon. Loomis soils lack a Btk horizon and have bedrock at 20 to 36 cm.  Rocconda soils have a depth to bedrock range from 10 to 36 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Jung soils are on mountain and hill crests and side slopes. Jung soils formed in residuum derived from metavolcanic and volcanic rocks. Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. Elevations are 1,515 to 2,317 meters. The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The average annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; average annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C; and the frost-free season is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Newpass and McVegas soils. These soil have a natric horizon and a duripan.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; moderately high or moderately low saturated hydrualic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Rangeland and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is principally black sagebrush, Thurber needlegrass and pine bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Nevada. These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 24, 27, 28B.
