JERICHO SERIES

The Jericho series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from igneous rocks.  Jericho soils are on fan remnants and ballenas.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Blackcan, Gravden, Gunnel, Karpp, Lien, and Rekima series. 

Blackcan soils lack C horizons.  Gunnel soils have duripans that are indurated for a thickness of more than 15 cm.  Karpp soils have 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Lien soils have duripans at depths of 15 to 36 cm.  Rekima soils have cambic horizons, do not have calcic horizons, and have lithic contacts between 43 to 50 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Jericho soils are on fan remnants and ballenas.  These soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from igneous rocks, but includes some sedimentary rocks. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Areas with slopes over 15 percent are the result of faulting subsequent to the formation of the duripan.  Elevations range from 1,405 to 2,320 meters.  The climate is semiarid continental.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 360 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C and the mean summer temperature is 16 to 18 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 100 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Truesdale, Sierocliff, Deerlodge, Medburn, Wales, and Doyce soils.  Medburn, Wales, and Doyce soils are very deep.  Sierocliff and Deerlodge are moderately deep to petrocalcic horizons and duripans, respectively.  Truesdale soils are coarse-loamy, moderately deep to duripans, and have cambic horizons and calcic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very high surface runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

.

USE AND VEGETATION: Jericho soils are used for rangeland.  The potential vegetation is black sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Utah and eastern Nevada.  These soils are extensive with about 135,000 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRAs 25, 28A, and 28B.
