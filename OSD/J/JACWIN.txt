JACWIN SERIES

The Jacwin series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy glacial sediments and in the underlying residuum from calcareous shale. These soils are on treads and risers on structural benches. Slopes range from 0 to 18 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C (47 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 83 centimeters (33 inches).

Drainage class--somewhat poorly drained--a saturated zone occurs within depths of 0.3 to 1 meter (12 to 40 inches) during the wettest portions of most years and is considered perched
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--moderately high in the loamy glacial sediments and low in the residuum
Surface runoff potential--negligible to medium

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters (10 to 40 inches) (A1, Bw, Bk, 2BCk, and 2Cr horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters 0 to 60 inches) (Ap, A1, Bw, Bk, 2BCk, and 2Cr horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 33 centimeters (0 to 13 inches) (Ap and A1 horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from 33 to 61 centimeters (13 to 24 inches) (Bw and Bk horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
