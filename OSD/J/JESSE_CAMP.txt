JESSE CAMP SERIES

The Jesse Camp series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine materials derived mainly from volcanic rocks with a component of volcanic ash. Jesse Camp soils are on inset fans, stream or lake terraces, and flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Xeric Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jesse Camp silt loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 10 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate thin platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; many fine and medium vesicular and interstitial pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 25 cm thick)

    Bw--10 to 30 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and coarse roots; common very fine and medium tubular pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (15 to 30 cm thick)

    Bqk1--30 to 66 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate thin platy; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; common fine and medium tubular pores; 5 percent brittle durinodes; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual smooth boundary.  (25 to 70 cm thick)

    Bqk2--66 to 152 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate thin platy structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; few fine tubular pores; common medium faint light gray (10YR 7/2) soft carbonate filaments; 15 percent brittle durinodes; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jesse Camp soils are on inset fans, stream or lake terraces and flood plains.  These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine materials derived mainly from mostly volcanic rocks with a component of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevations are 1,375 to 2,320 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm; mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 80 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Crutcher, Disabel, Kisring, and Lolak soils.  Crutcher soils have a fine particle-size control section.  Disabel soils have a fine texture natric horizon.  Kisring soils are somewhat poorly drained, have iron mottles at depths of 50 to 100 cm, have a fine loamy particle-size control section and a calcic horizon.  Lolak soils are poorly drained and have a fine particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow or very slow runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Some areas are subject to occasional overflow.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly big sagebrush and basin wildrye.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North western and north central Nevada; adjacent areas in California and Oregon.  These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28B, 24 and 26.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Washoe County, Nevada, 1971.

REMARKS:  The typical pedon is moved from Surprise Valley-Home Camp Area, California and Nevada to Lander County, Nevada, South Part to better represent the series concept. March, 2004.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the surface to 18 cm (A and part of the Bw horizon).
Cambic horizon - The zone from about 10 to 30 cm (Bw horizon).
Identifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 30 to 152 cm (Bqk1 and Bqk2 horizons).
Xeric feature - Soil moisture regime is aridic bordering xeric.
Particle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (part of the Bw, the Bqk1 horizon and a portion of the Bqk2 horizon).
