JETCOP SERIES

The Jetcop series consists of shallow to duripan, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from basalt with a component of volcanic ash.  Jetcop soils are on plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Abruptic Xeric Argidurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jetcop very cobbly loamy sand--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is partially covered with 30 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 3 percent stones.

    A1--0 to 8 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very cobbly loamy sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common very fine interstitial and few very fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; violently effervescent; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 10 cm thick)

    A2--8 to 15 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly loamy sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine interstitial and few very fine vesicular pores; 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 cm thick)

    Bt1--15 to 23 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine to medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel; common distinct clay films on ped faces; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 13 cm thick)

    Bt2--23 to 41 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine and medium angular blocky structure; hard, very friable, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine, few fine and medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; 30 percent gravel; few prominent clay films on ped faces, many distinct clay films on ped faces and lining pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 20 cm thick)

    Bqkm--41 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) indurated duripan, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist; massive; strongly silica-carbonate cemented; highly fractured; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3)

TYPE LOCATION:  Mineral County, Nevada; approximately 4 miles west of Basalt site, about 1,840 feet north and 1,050 feet east of the southwest corner of Section 18, T. 2 N., R. 33 E.; USGS Basalt 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 01 minute, 40 seconds N and longitude 118 degrees 20 minutes 59 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.0278889 latitude, -118.3497222  longitude. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in winter and spring, dry in summer and fall except for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October due to convection storms; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 15 degrees C.
Depth to indurated duripan: 36 to 50 cm.
Reaction:  Neutral or slightly alkaline.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  35 to 50 percent.
Rock fragments:  15 to 35 percent.

A horizon
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Structure:  Subangular blocky, platy or single grained.

Bt horizons
Hue:  l0YR or 7.5YR.
Chroma:  3 or 4.
Texture:  Clay loam or clay.
Structure:  Angular or subangular blocky in the Btl horizon; angular blocky in the Bt2 horizon.
Consistence:  Slightly hard or hard dry.

Bqkm horizons
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Rock fragments:  25 to 50 percent.
Other features:  1 mm to 10 mm thick continuous silica laminar cap occurs on the upper surface of the duripan.  Below are alternating layers of strongly silica cementation and indurated silica laminae.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jetcop soils are on plateaus.  These soils formed in residuum derived from basalt with a component of volcanic ash. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 1,646 to 2,347 meters. The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free season is l00 to l30 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Gabbvally and Garhill soils.  Gabbvally soils do not have a duripan.  Garhill soils lack an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, Nevada ephedra, galleta, Indian ricegrass and some spiny menodora.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  West-central Nevada.  These soils are not extensive. MLRA 29.
