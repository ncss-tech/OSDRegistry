JAYEM SERIES

The Jayem series consists of very deep, well to somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sediments weathered from noncalcareous sandstone. Jayem soils are on uplands and have slopes of 0 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jayem fine sandy loam-rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated)

     A--0 to 10 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (7 to 20 inches thick)

     Bw--10 to 22 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; very few faint clay bridges between sand grains; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 20 inches thick)

     C--22 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly alkaline.  (pH 7.4)

TYPE LOCATION:  Goshen County, Wyoming; 1,850 feet south and 45 feet west of the NE corner of sec. 16, T. 30 N., R. 60 W. 42 degrees, 34 minutes, 40 seconds, north latitude and 104 degrees, 3 minutes, 51 seconds, west longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Particle-size control section: loamy very fine sand, fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam with 5 to 18 percent clay, 5 to 35 percent silt, and 50 to 80 percent sand with more than 15 percent being fine sand or coarser
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent
Reaction: neutral or slightly alkaline
Mean annual soil temperature: 47 to 56 degrees F.
Mean summer soil temperature: 60 to 76 degrees F.
Mollic epipedon: 7 to 20 inches thick
Notes: Some pedons have buried horizons in the lower part of the series control section. 

A horizon:
Hue: 2.5Y or 10YR
Value: 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: commonly fine sandy loam or sandy loam, but may be loamy sand loamy fine sand or loamy very fine sand in some areas

Bw horizon:
Hue: 2.5Y, 10YR or 7.5YR
Value: 4 to 6 dry and 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: commonly fine sandy loam or sandy loam, but may range to loamy very fine sand or very fine sandy loam in some areas.  Some pedons in Nebraska have loam, silt loam and sandy clay loam in this horizon.

C horizon:
Hue: 2.5Y, 10YR or 7.5YR
Value: 5 to 7 dry and 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 2 to 6dry or moist
Texture: commonly fine sandy loam, but ranges to sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or loamy very fine sand.  Some pedons have loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sand or sand below a depth of 40 inches.
Notes: Some pedons contain less than 5 percent carbonates below 40 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alice, Blanche, Busher, Chappell (P), Creighton, Phiferson(T), Stapleton, and Unaweep series.

Alice: are calcareous and have continuous horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation
Blanche: have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches
Busher: have carbonates at depths of less than 36 inches
Chappell: have over 35 percent coarse fragments in the lower part of the control section
Creighton: are calcareous and have continuous horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation
Phiferson: are calcareous and have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches
Stapleton: formed in sediments derived from arkose deposits and contain a moderate to high percentage of medium and coarse angular granitic sand and fine and very fine angular gravel, are also extremely hard when dry (it is assumed the soil is competing pending an update of the classification)

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: uplands and tablelands
Landform: hills, terraces and alluvial fans
Parent material: alluvium derived primarily from noncalcareous, fine grained sandstone
Slopes: 0 to 20 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 12 to 18 inches, with peak periods of precipitation occurring during the spring and early summer
Mean annual air temperature: 45 to 53 degrees F.
Mean summer temperature: 69 degrees F.
Elevation: 3500 to 5500 feet above sea level
Frost-free period: 105 to 150 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Alice (competing): have free carbonates above 38 inches, on the same landscape positions
Bayard: lack cambic horizons and are calcareous above 20 inches soils, on the same landscape positions
Dailey: have drier control sections, on the same landscape positions
Julesburg: have argillic horizons, on the same landscape positions

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage: well or somewhat excessively
Runoff: slow
Permeability: moderately rapid

USE AND VEGETATION:  The soils are used for native pasture, dry cropland, irrigated cropland and irrigated pasture.  Principal native plants are blue grama, prairie sandreed, needleandthread and threadleaf sedge.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern Wyoming, Western Nebraska, and South Dakota.  The series is of moderate extent.
