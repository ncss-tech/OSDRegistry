JULESBURG SERIES

The Julesburg series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in wind-laid or wind-modified materials.  Julesburg soils are on hills and plains and have slopes of 0 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 43 centimeters (17 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C. (48 degrees F.)

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Julesburg sandy loam - grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

  A--0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 25 centimeters (4 to 10 inches) thick)

  BA--15 to 25 centimeters (6 to 10 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; few faint clay films on faces of peds; some wax-like bridges between sand grains; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual smooth boundary.  (10 to 20 centimeters (4 to 8 inches) thick)

  Bt1--25 to 61 centimeters (10 to 24 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocks; slightly hard, very friable; few faint clay films on faces of peds; few faint clay films on sand grains and as bridges between sand grains; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual smooth boundary.  (30 to 56 centimeters (12 to 22 inches) thick)

  Bt2--61 to 81 centimeters (24 to 32 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable; few faint clay films on sand grains; few faint clay film bridges between sand grains; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 25 centimeters (0 to 10 inches) thick)

  C--81 to 152 centimeters (32 to 60 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; loose; neutral (pH 7.2).

TYPE LOCATION:  Sedgwick County, Colorado; 318 meters (1,043 feet) north and 50 meters (165 feet) east of SW1/4 corner Sec. 17, T. 9 N., R. 46 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 14 degrees C. (47 to 58 degrees F.)
Mean summer soil temperature: 15 to 26 degrees C. (59 to 78 degrees F.)
Mollic epipedon: 18 to 49 centimeters (7 to 19 inches) thick
Depth to calcareous material: 127 to over 152 centimeters (50 to over 60 inches)  Depth of argillic horizon: 36 to 102 centimeters (14 to 40 inches)  
Mollic epipedon organic carbon: .8 to 2 percent and decreases uniformly with increasing depth  
Base saturation: 90 to 100 percent   
Rock fragments: typically less than 2 percent and range from 0 to 15 percent

A horizon:
Hue: 2.5Y or 10YR
Value: 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3  
Structure: soft or slightly hard 
Reaction: neutral or slightly alkaline
Texture: sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy sand.

Bt horizon:
Hue: 2.5Y or 10YR
Value: 5 or 6, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: sandy loam or fine sandy loam 
Clay: 10 to 18 percent
Silt: 5 to 35 percent
Sand: 52 to 80 percent, more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand
Structure: prismatic but has subangular blocky structure in some pedons
Reaction: neutral to moderately alkaline.

C horizon:
Hue: 2.5Y or 10YR
Value: 5 or 6, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4
Reaction: neutral or slightly alkaline
Texture: loamy sand, sand, loamy fine sand, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Latierra, Mainter, Manter, Mawer, Torrington, Truckton and Vitrina series. 
Latierra and Vitrina soils have a higher rock fragment of 10 to 50 percent.
Mainter soils contain calcium carbonate is 14 to 30 inches.  
Torrington soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 51 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches). 
Manter soils are calcareous above a depth of 102 centimeters (40 inches) and have a continuous horizon of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation.  
Mawer soils have a noncontrasting sandy-skeletal substratum at depths of less than 102 centimeters (40 inches).  
Truckton soils have a high percentage of medium and coarse angular granite sand and have extremely hard semi-cemented consistence in the horizons of low organic carbon content when the soil is air dried.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: eolian parent materials or tertiary pedisediments that have been modified by eolian action
Landform: hills, terraces, and plains.  
Slopes: 0 to about 20 percent  
Average annual precipitation: 30 to 46 centimeters (12 to 18 inches) peak periods of precipitation spring and early summer  
Average annual temperature: 9 degrees C. (48 degrees F.)
Average summer temperature: 22 degrees C. (71 degrees F.)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dailey, Jayem, and Vona soils and the competing Manter soils.  
Vona soils lack a mollic epipedon and are calcareous above a depth of 102 centimeters (40 inches).  
Dailey soils have more sand in their control sections and both Dailey and Jayem soils lack an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage: well drained
Runoff: low or medium 
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: high

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly as native rangeland or as dry cropland.   
In some localities they are irrigated.  
Natural vegetation is bluestem, blue grama, and sand sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern Colorado and Wyoming and Western Nebraska.  The series is of moderate extent.
