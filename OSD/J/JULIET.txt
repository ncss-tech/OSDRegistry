JULIET SERIES

The Juliet series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial till. Juliet soils are on moraines. Slopes are 4 to 35 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 500 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Pachic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Juliet very gravelly loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted) The soil surface is partially covered with approximately 10 percent stones, 10 percent cobbles, and 40 percent gravel.

    A--0 to 13 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2), very gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; 50 percent sand; 9 percent clay; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine irregular pores; 35 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, 8 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.5); noneffervescent; abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 25 cm thick)

    Bw1--13 to 41 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely cobbly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic; common very fine irregular pores; 40 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.7); noneffervescent; abrupt smooth boundary. (10 to 30 cm thick)

    Bw2--41 to 90 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely cobbly sandy clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky, nonplastic; common very fine irregular pores; 30 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.8); noneffervescent; abrupt smooth boundary. (15 to 50 cm thick)

    C--90 to 150 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely cobbly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic; common very fine roots throughout; many very fine irregular pores; 25 percent gravel, 35 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.8); noneffervescent.

COMPETING SERIES: These are Baconcamp, Badgerton, Badhap, Behanco, Behanin, Belsac, Boatman, Boydhollow, Bullrey, Busterback, Croesus, Dressel, Gateview, Goodski, Hapgood, Harcany, Hobacker, Kious, Lionhead, Lolon, Lund, Marcetta, Mundos, Nagitsy, Namela, Nazaton, Papaspila, Parkcity, Poleline, Povey, Snacreek, Snopoc, Sparky, Splitbutte, Sweethollow, and Tonigut series.

Baconcamp, Behanco, Belsac, Croesus, Goodski, Hapgood, Kious, Nagasty, Namela, Poleline, Povey, Splitbutte and Tonigut soils all have bedrock within 150cm. Badhap, Gateview, Lolon, and Marcetta soils lack cambic horizons. Hobacker, Boydhollow, Lionhead, Lund, and Mundos soils have secondary carbonates in the profile. Bagerton, Busterback, Harcany, Parkcity, Snacreek, Snopoc, and Sweethollow soils have less than 18 percent clay in the control section. Bullrey soils have flat and angular rock fragments and ustic soil moisture regimes. Dressel soils have sandstone fragments and E horizons. Boatman, Behanin, Sparky, Nazaton, and Papaspila soils all have udic soil moisture regimes and O horizons. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Juliet soils are on moraines. They formed in glacial till. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 2,000 to 2,800 meters. Climate is cold, semiarid with cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 600 mm that comes largely as winter snow. The mean annual temperature is 3 to 7 degrees C and the frost-free period is less than 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Glideski, Gaia, and Dehana series. Glideski and Dehana soils have argillic horizons. Gaia soils are not pachic and have less than 18 percent clay in the control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium to very high surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Juliet soils are used mainly for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation consists mainly of mountain big sagebrush, snowberry, basin wildrye, and mountain brome.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern Nevada in MLRA 25.  These soils are not extensive.
