SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Clark County, Idaho; 1959

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features in this pedon
Mollic epipedon--zone from the surface to a depth of 28 cm (A1, A2, and ABk horizons)
Calcic horizon--zone from 15 to 150 cm (ABk, Bk1, Bk2, and Bkq horizons)
Depth to lithic contact--150 cm (2R horizon)
Particle-size control section-- zone from 25 to 100 cm

Based on the final mapping extent, the type location was moved in 2008 from north of Dubois to the current location. This location better reflects the concept of the series, which includes a profile that is deep to basalt and has carbonate nodules.
