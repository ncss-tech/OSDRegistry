TYPE LOCATION:  Hendry County, Florida; about 2.3 miles west of Clewiston on US Hwy 27 and 5 miles south; about 1,322 feet and 130 feet south of the northeast corner of Sec. 7, T. 44 S., R. 34 E.; latitude 26 degrees 40 minutes 52.40 seconds N, longitude 80 degrees 58 seconds 15.18 seconds W; Datum WSG84; USGS Clewiston South, FL quadrangle.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Solum thickness: 51 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches)
Depth to seasonally high water table: 0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches)
Soil Reaction: Very strongly acid to moderately alkaline (pH 4.5 to 8.4)
Depth of mollic epipedon: 15 to 25 centimeters (6 to 10 inches)
Depth to bedrock: 51 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches)
Depth to redoximorphic features: 15 to 102 centimeters (6 to 40 inches)
EC (mmhos/cm): 0 to 2
Exchangeable Sodiuum: 0 to 4 percent
Sodium Absorption Ratio: 0 to 4 percent
The Bw horizons do not meet the characteristics of a diagnostic cambic horizon.

Particle-size control section (weighted averages):  
Clay content: 0 to 8 percent
Fine sand content: 30 to 75 percent

A or Ap horizon:
Color: hue of 10YR , value of 2 or 3, chroma of 1 
Texture: fine sand or sand
Clay content: 0 to 7 percent
Rock fragments: 0
Reaction: very strongly acid to moderately acid (pH 4.5 to 6.0)  

E horizon:
Color: hue of 10YR, value: 5 to 8,l chroma of 1 to 4
Texture: fine sand or sand
Clay content: 0 to 5 percent
Rock fragments: 0
Reaction: strongly acid to slightly acid (pH 5.1 to 6.5)  
Organic matter streaking: faint or distinct, fine or medium, none to common 

Bw horizon:
Color: hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, chroma of 1 to 3
Texture: fine sand or sand 
Redoximorphic features: depletions or concentrations, 1 to 20 percent, and fine or medium in size
Clay content: 1 to 7 percent
Rock fragments: 0 to 10 percent gravel
Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline (pH 6.1 to 7.8)  
Organic matter streaking: faint or distinct, fine or medium, none to common 
The Bw horizon has a 1 to 3 percent increase in clay content, however it is cyclic and too discontinuous or thin and does not meet the requirements of an argillic horizon.  

C or Cg horizon, where present:
Color: hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 3 to 6
Texture: fine sand, sand, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam
Redoximorphic features: depletions and/or concentrations, 1 to 20 percent, and fine or medium in size
Clay content: 0 to 40 percent
Rock fragments: 0 to 60 percent gravel
Reaction: slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline (pH 7.4 to 8.4)  

2R horizon: weakly to strongly cemented porous rippable oolitic limestone.  
Solution holes in the limestone range from about 15 centimeters to 1 meter (6 inches to 3 feet) in diameter and occur at intervals of about 1 to 2 meters (2 to 6 feet). In the deeper solution pits the B horizon is thicker and finer textured and may qualify for an argillic horizon.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Captiva (FL) series.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  
Basinger soils have spodic materials, are very deep, and occur on similar or lower landforms.
Brynwood soils have limestone bedrock at depths of 25 to 51 centimeters (10 to 20 inches) and occur on similar landforms. 
Cypress Lake soils have an argillic horizon and occur on similar landforms.
Immokalee soils have a spodic horizon and occur on similar landforms on higher terraces.
Plantation and Sanibel soils have histic epipedons, are very poorly drained, are ponded, and occur on slightly lower landforms.
Pompano soils are very deep, can be ponded, and occur on slightly lower landforms.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class: Very poorly or poorly drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (KSAT): High to very high
Permeability: Rapid 
Runoff: Negligible to very low.
Depth to seasonal high water table: 0 to 46 centimeters (0 to 18 inches) of the surface for about 6 to 9 months undrained areas during most years, and 0 to 46 centimeters (0 to 18 inches) for 4 to 6 months in drained areas during most years.
Ponding: 0 to 64 centimeters (0 to 24 inches) about 4 to 9 months each year for very long periods

USE AND VEGETATION:  
Major uses: water quality and wildlife habitat. Where drained, it is used improved pasture, rangeland, and citrus.  
Dominant vegetation: waxmyrtle, pineland threeawn, St. Johnswort, and scattered cypress.
