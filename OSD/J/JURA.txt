JURA SERIES

The Jura series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from igneous and sedimentary rocks. The Jura soils are on alluvial flats. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Typic Haplotorrerts

TYPICAL PEDON: Jura clay, on a level area under alfalfa at an elevation of 1,615 m. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).  When described on April 22, 2008, the soil had cracks 1 to 5 cm wide extending from the surface to a depth of 82 cm.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Jura soils formed in alluvium from igneous and sedimentary rocks.  The Jura soils are on alluvial flats and basin floors. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Elevations are 1,610 to 1,660 meters. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm. The mean annual temperature is 8.0 to 10.5 degrees C and the frost-free period is 100 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Genola, Glenwood, Monroe, Okerland  and Woodrow soils. Genola and Woodrow soils are fine-silty in the particle-size control section.  Glenwood soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal in the particle-size control section.  Monroe and Okerland soils are fine-loamy in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, runoff is negligible, slow and very slow permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of the Jura series are used for irrigated cropland. Principal crops are alfalfa, small grains, and silage corn. Other uses include wildlife habitat and irrigated pasture.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Utah. MLRA 28A. The series is inextensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Richfield Area, Utah, 1947.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon -  The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (Ap and part of the Bss horizons).
Vertic features - Slickensides in the zone from 12 to 140 cm (Bss, Bkss horizons).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Bkss and part of Bss and  Bkss horizons).

The type location was changed in June 2009, with subsequent concept change from the very-fine to fine particle-size class.
