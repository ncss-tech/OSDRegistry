JEAN SERIES

The Jean series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in sandy alluvial or aeolian materials over unconforming sandy-skeletal sediments from mixed rock sources.  The Jean soils are on erosional fan remnants, inset fans, and channels.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 65 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, thermic Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jean gravelly loamy fine sandy-rangeland and wildlife habitat.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered by approximately 40 percent pebbles and a 1 percent cobbles.

    A--0 to 1 inch; pink (7.5YR 7/4) gravelly loamy fine sand, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak medium platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine, and few medium vesicular pores; 20 percent pebbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline; (pH 8.3); abrupt smooth boundary. (l/2 to 2 inches thick)

	AB--1 to 8 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) loamy fine sand, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) moist; weak very coarse prismatic structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline; (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 8 inches thick)

    Bk1--8 to 18 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/4) loamy fine sand, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; distinct calcium carbonate films on bottom of rock fragments; l0 percent pebbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline; (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to l2 inches thick)

    2Bk2--18 to 25 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/4) very gravelly loamy sand, light reddish brown (7.5 6/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; distinct calcium carbonate coats on bottom of rock fragments; 40 percent pebbles; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline; (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to l0 inches thick)

    2C--25 to 60 inches; pink stratified extremely gravelly sand through very gravelly loamy fine sand, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4)

TYPE LOCATION:  Clark County, Nevada; near the intersection of Decator Boulevard and Robindale Road; about 2,640 feet south of the northwest corner of section 7, T. 22 S., R. 6l E.; USGS Las Vegas SW, NV 7.5 minute quadrangle; 36 degrees, 2 minutes, 58 seconds north latitude and 115 degrees, 12 minutes, 27 seconds west longitude; UTM 11s, 661450e 3990930n; NAD83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture:  Usually dry.  Moist for short periods throughout the moisture control section December through March.  Moist above and periodically in upper part of moisture control section, l to l0 days cumulative, June through August.
Soil temperature:  65 to 7l degrees F.
Depth to Bkl horizon:  5 to l0 inches.
Depth to skeletal material:  l6 to 30 inches.

Control section
Texture of upper portion:  Loamy fine sand or fine sand with less than l5 percent rock fragments.
Texture of lower portion:  Averages extremely gravelly sand through very gravelly loamy fine sand.
Rock fragments:  Averages 35 to 80 percent, mostly gravel.  
Reaction:  Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

A horizon
Hue:  5YR, 7.5YR or l0YR
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist.
Chroma:  2 to 4.

AB horizon:
Hue:  5YR, or 7.5YR or l0YR.
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  3 through 5.
Other features:  Redder hues and higher chroma reflect lithochromic colors.

C horizon
Calcium carbonate segregations:  Commonly contains thin calcium carbonate coatings on undersides of pebbles or a few soft calcium carbonate masses within 40 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Arizo, Kokan, and Wickenburg soils.  Arizo and Kokan soils lack Bw horizons and are skeletal throughout the control section.  Wickenburg soils have a paralithic contact with granitic bedrock at a depth between 20 and 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jean soils are on erosional fan remnants, inset fans, and channels.  These soils formed in sandy alluvial or aeolian materials underlain by unconforming sandy-skeletal sediments from mixed rock sources.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations are 2,000 to 3,600 feet.  The climate is arid with hot dry summers and mild winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 7 inches; mean annual temperature is 62 to 68 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 240 to 300 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arizo Caliza, Goodsprings, Las Vegas, and McCullough series.  Caliza soils have a calcic horizon.  Goodsprings and Las Vegas soils have petrocalcic horizons.  McCullough soils have coarse-loamy control sections.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Excessively drained; very low runoff; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for rangeland, and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly creosotebush, white bursage, big galleta and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mojave Desert of southern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.
