JONAH SERIES

The Jonah series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum weathered from sandstone, shale and mudstone. These soils are on hillslopes, mesas and pediments. Slopes are 1 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 225 mm and annual air temperature is about 4.5 degrees C.
