JURY SERIES

The Jury series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in weathered granitic or metamorphic colluvium and residuum with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  They are on mountain slopes and ridges.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and moderately rapid or rapid in the lower part.  Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent.  The average precipitation is about 42 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jury soils are on mountain slopes and ridges at elevations of 3,000 to 5,200 feet with slopes of 5 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in material from granitic or metamorphic rocks with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  The average annual air temperature is 38 to 44 degrees F.  The average precipitation is 40 to 60 inches and the frost-free season is 50 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dullaxe, Judgetown, Fico and Weitas soils.  Dullaxe soils are on convex mountain sides and lower ridges and are in an ashy family.  Judgetown soils are on convex mountain sides and lower ridges, are in an ashy family and are deep to a paralithic contact.  Fico soils are on higher convex mountain slopes and summits and are cryic.  Weitas soils are on higher concave mountain slopes, have an umbric epipedon and are cryic.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to very rapid runoff; moderate permeability in the upper part and moderately rapid to rapid in the lower part.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, wildlife habitat, watershed and recreation.  Potential natural vegetation is western red cedar, grand fir, western white pine, western larch and Douglas-fir with an understory of wild ginger, queencup beadlily, common goldthread, oneleaf foamflower, bunchberry dogwood, prince's pine and rustyleaf menziesia.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North Central Idaho, Jury soils are not extensive
