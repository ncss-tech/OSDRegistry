JONLAKE SERIES

The Jonlake series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from quartzite with local admixtures of argillite. The Jonlake soils are on mountains. Slopes are 8 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 500 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Lithic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Jonlake extremely gravelly loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered with approximately 40 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, and 2 percent stones.

     A1--0 to 15 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 55 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 20 cm thick)

     A2--15 to 28 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 65 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 18 cm thick) 

     A3--28 to 36 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 55 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 13 cm thick)

     C--36 to 43 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 60 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt irregular boundary.  (8 to 18 cm thick)

     R--43 cm; hard quartzite bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Jonlake soils are on mountains and typically occur on summit and backslope positions. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from quartzite with local admixtures of argillite. Slopes are 8 to 75 percent. Elevations are 2,070 to 3,170 m. The climate is moist-subhumid, cold wet winters and warm dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 450 to 700 mm, the mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 40 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Hapgood and Topeki series. Hapgood soils are very deep and have mollic epipedons which are greater than 40 cm thick. Topeki soils have dominantly cobble and stone rock fragments in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:: Well drained; medium to very high runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Livestock grazing, recreation and wildlife habitat. The potential native vegetation is mainly low sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass and bluegrass. This site is correlated to Ecological Site R28AY061NV Claypan 14+ P.Z. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: East Central Nevada. MLRA 28A. These soils are not extensive.
