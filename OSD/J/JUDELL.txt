JUDELL SERIES

The Judell series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvium and colluvium derived mainly from limestone.  These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, carbonatic, frigid Typic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Judell clay loam, grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 7 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine and very fine roots and common medium and coarse roots; less than 5 percent limestone pebbles; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

    Bk1--7 to 11 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine and very fine roots and common medium and coarse roots; many fine and very fine pores; less than 5 percent limestone pebbles; few fine irregular soft masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 10 inches)

    Bk2--11 to 28 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) clay loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and very fine roots and few medium and coarse roots; many fine and very fine pores and few medium pores; less than 5 percent lime coated pebbles; common fine and medium irregular soft masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 16 inches thick)

    Bk3--28 to 54 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; common fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and very fine roots and few medium roots; many fine and very fine pores; less than 5 percent limestone pebbles; disseminated lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (20 to 36 inches thick)

    2C--54 to 67 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and very fine roots; common very fine and fine pores; 60 percent pebbles, 5 percent cobbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4)
