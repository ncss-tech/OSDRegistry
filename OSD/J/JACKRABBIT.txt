JACKRABBIT SERIES 

The Jackrabbit series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in eolian sands deposits.  These soils occur on dunes, dune fields, and interdunes. Slopes are 1 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 390 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed Ustic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jackrabbit loamy fine sand, in rangeland on a 6 percent slope at 2,049 meters elevation (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

       A -- 0 to 31 centimeters; brown (10YR 4/3) loamy fine sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual smooth boundary. (25 to 50 cm thick)

       Bw -- 31 to 85 centimeters; brown (10YR 5/3) loamy fine sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual smooth boundary. (13 to 99 cm thick)

       C -- 85 to 159 centimeters; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 2 percent gravel; very slightly effervescent, slightly alkaline (pH 7.4).

COMPETING SERIES:  
Bangston (CO) - have sandstone fragments in the profile 
Beeftrail (MT) - moderately deep to paralithic contact
Tomichi (CO) - do not have a Bw horizon
Wissikihon (MT) - deep to paralithic contact

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform - dunes, dunefields, and interdunes 
Elevation - 2,025 to 2,135 meters
Slope - 1 to 35 percent 
Parent materials - eolian sands and alluvium 
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; cool summers 
Mean annual precipitation - 355 to 430 millimeters
Mean annual air temperature - 1 to 4 degrees C 
Frost-free period - 50 to 70 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  none listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  excessively drained; rapid permeability 

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for rangeland.  Vegetation is chiefly sagebrush and native grass such as needle-and-thread and Idaho fescue along with Hood's phlox and lupine. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The Jackrabbit series is of small extent in the intermountain valleys of southwestern Montana. MLRA 44B.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Red Rock Lakes Area - Part of Beaverhead County, Montana, 2012; proposed in Beaverhead County, Montana, 2010.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  
Mollic epipedon - from the soil surface to 31 cm (A horizon); and a
Particle-size control section - from 25 to 100 cm (part of the A, Bw, and part of the C horizons).

Jackrabbit soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
