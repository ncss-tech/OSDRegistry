JOULA SERIES

The Joula series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loamy glaciolacustrine deposits. These soils are on glacial lake plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 670 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aquic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Joula loam, on a convex slope of 2 percent on a glacial lake plain in a cultivated field.  Elevation is about 390 meters. (Colors are for moist unless otherwise stated.)

    Ap--0 to 23 centimeters; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) loam, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; weak fine and medium granular structure; friable; many fine and medium roots; strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 25 centimeters thick; if an A, 8 to 15 centimeters thick)

    Bw--23 to 36 centimeters; olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) sandy loam; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine and few medium roots; few coarse faint dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) redoximorphic concentrations; slightly acid, clear wavy boundary. (10 to 51 centimeters thick)

    Bg--36 to 74 centimeters; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) sandy loam; weak fine and medium subangular blocky; friable; few fine and medium roots; common medium distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) redoximorphic concentrations; strongly acid, clear wavy boundary. (0 to 51 centimeters thick)

    C--74 to 203 centimeters; olive (5Y 5/3) silt loam; massive; friable; few fine faint light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) redoximorphic concentrations and few medium distinct olive gray (5Y 5/2) iron depletions; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) 88-Northern Minnesota Glacial Lake Basins; St. Louis County, Minnesota; about 2 miles northeast of Meadowlands; located about 300 feet east and 1,600 feet north of the southwest corner of section 12, T. 53 N., R. 19W.; USGS Meadowlands quadrangle, latitude 47 degrees 5 minutes 23 seconds N., longitude 92 degrees 42 minutes 5 seconds W., NAD83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth to carbonates--50 to 100 centimeters

These soils do not have rock fragments

Ap or A horizon:
Hue--10YR
Value--2 or 3, 4 or 5 dry
Chroma--1 or 2, 1 or 2 dry
Texture--silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam
Reaction--strongly acid to neutral

Bw horizon:
Hue--10YR to 2.5Y
Value--4 to 6
Chroma--3
Texture--loam, silt loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand, or very fine sandy loam
Reaction--moderately acid to neutral
The Bw horizon typically has redoximorphic concentrations

Bg horizon where present:
Hue--10YR to 2.5Y
Value--4 to 6
Chroma--3
Texture--loam, silt loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand, or very fine sandy loam
Reaction--moderately acid to neutral
The Bg horizon typically has distinct to prominent redoximorphic concentrations

Some pedons have a BC horizon.

C or Cg horizon:
Hue--2.5Y or 5Y
Value--5 or 6
Chroma--1 to 3
Texture--silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or silty clay loam
Reaction--moderately alkaline to neutral
The C or Cg horizon typically has distinct to prominent redoximorphic concentrations and or depletions

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Sundell, Tolna and the Witknee soils.
Sundell soils have limestone bedrock between 50 and 100 centimeters. Tolna and Witknee soils have sandy textures and gravel in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--loamy glaciolacustrine deposits
Landform--convex surfaces of glacial lake plains
Slope--1 to 3 percent
Mean annual air temperature--3 to 5 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation--635 to 711 millimeters
Frost-free period--95 to 125 days
Elevation--350 to 490 meters above sea level

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Leeora and Meadowlands soils. These soils formed in the same parent material as the Joula soils and form a hydrosequence with the Joula soils.
Leeora - are in lower landscape positions in drainageways and depressions and are in the Mollic Endoaquepts subgroup
Meadowlands - are in slightly lower landscape positions on flats and are in the Mollic Endoaquepts subgroup

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--somewhat poorly drained--these soils have a frequently saturated zone within a depth of 0.46 meter below the surface during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--1.00 to 100.00 micrometers per second
Joula soils do not have ponding above the surface in the spring and fall of most years.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cropped for hay or used for pasture.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Physiographic Division--Interior Plains or Laurentian Upland
Physiographic Province--Central Lowland or Superior Upland

MLRA--Northern Minnesota Glacial Lake Basins(88)
LRR--K; northeastern Minnesota
Extent--moderate
