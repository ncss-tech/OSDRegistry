JOCITY SERIES

The Jocity series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in stream alluvium. Jocity soils are on flood plains, and alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Typic Torrifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Jocity sandy clay loam-rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)
 A--0 to 9 inches; reddish gray (5YR 5/2) sandy clay loam, dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; common very fine pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 11 inches thick)
 C1--9 to 41 inches; reddish gray (5YR 5/2) stratified sandy clay loam, dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2) moist; massive; very hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; few very fine vesicular and tubular pores; few fine prominent white flecks of gypsum; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (20 to 36 inches thick)
 C2--41 to 60 inches; gray (5YR 5/1) fine sandy loam, dark gray (5YR 4/1) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly plastic; few fine roots; many very fine pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

TYPE LOCATION: Navajo County, Arizona; near Highway 66 west of Joseph City, southwest 1/4 of section 7, T. 18 N., R. 19 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during December-February and July-September. Driest during May and June. Typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Soil Temperature: 50 to 59 degrees F.

Clay content in the particle-size control section: averages 18 to 35 percent; sand coarser than very fine is more than 15 percent
Calcium carbonate: slightly to strongly effervescent throughout the control section. Some pedons are noneffervescent in the upper part.
Sodicity: SAR is usually less than 10 but can range up to 35 in some pedons
Salinity: Electrical conductivity is usually less than 2 dS/m, but ranges to as much as 30 or more in some pedons 
Reaction: slightly alkaline to very strongly alkaline 

A horizon 
Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR 
Value: 4 to 7 dry, 3 to  6 moist 
Chroma: 1 to 6, dry or moist 

C horizon 
Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR
Value:  3 to 7 dry,  2 to 5 moist 
Chroma: 1 to 6, dry or moist 
Texture: sandy clay loam with strata of sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam. 
Other features: some pedons contain sand to clay strata at depths of 40 to 60 inches

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Battlerock (CO), Binton (WY), Boysen (WY), Clayhole (AZ), Lostwells (WY), Toddler (UT), and Youngston (WY) soils. Battlerock soils have 10YR hues or yellower. Binton, Boysen, Lostwells, Toddler and Youngston soils have soil temperatures that range from 47 to 50 degrees F. and are moist in some part of the moisture control section for longer periods in May and June. Clayhole soils have layers with high accumulation of gypsum crystals. Toddler soils are dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section from July to September and have hue of 10YR or yellower.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Jocity soils are on flood plains, low stream terraces and alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent but can range up to 8 percent in the high mountain areas. They formed in Holocene stream alluvium from sandstone, shale and other rocks. Elevation is 4,400 to 6,200 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 48 to 57 degrees F. The frost-free period is 120 to 190 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Tours, Ives, and Navajo soils. They are on adjacent flood plains and alluvial fans, and are fine-silty, coarse-loamy and fine textured, respectively.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderately slow to moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used primarily for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Vegetation includes chamiza, galleta, alkali sacaton, blue and black grama and a few juniper trees. Where irrigated and cultivated, alfalfa, corn and truck crops are grown.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Arizona, northwestern New Mexico, and southern Utah. The Jocity soils are moderately extensive. MLRAs 35 & 36.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Navajo County, Arizona, Holbrook-Show Low Area; 1961

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 9 inches (A horizon) 
Entisol feature - The absence of diagnostic subsurface horizons The soils correlated in Sandoval County Area, New Mexico have a water table at 40 to 60 inches from April to October. These soils would now be a new series with the 1992 revision to the series control section. Need to update the series concept as soon as work begins updating the MLRA.
Classified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 11th   Edition, 2010.
Updated and revised for the correlation of Ft. Defiance Area AZ715 2/08 DW
Update and revisions for the correlation of Chinle Area (AZ713), August 2011, LJG2
