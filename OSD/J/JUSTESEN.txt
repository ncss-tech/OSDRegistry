JUSTESEN SERIES 

The Justesen series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from rhyolitic, basaltic, and sedimentary rocks. Justesen soils are on alluvial fans, fan terraces, foothills and basalt plains and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Argixerolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Justesen loam - on a 6 percent slope at an elevation of 4,740 feet in rangeland.  When described on September 9, 1982, the soil was dry throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    A1--0 to 2 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, medium and few coarse roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.

    Bt2--15 to 20 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; about 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (5 to 15 inches thick) 

    Bw--20 to 24 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few fine tubular pores; about 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 11 inches thick) 

    Bk1--24 to 30 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few fine tubular pores; about 5 percent gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 10 inches thick) 

    Bk2--30 to 42 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few fine tubular pores; about 10 percent gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (9 to 14 inches thick) 

    Bk3--42 to 62 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) fine sandy loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; massive, slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky; few fine tubular pores; about 10 percent gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bess, Border, Chesnimnus, McCarey, Pegram, Vicking, and Victon series.  Border and Pegram soils contain more than 35 percent rock fragments below the argillic horizon. Chesnimnus soils have an influence of volcanic ash in the upper part. McCarey soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Bess, Vicking and Victon soils are less than 24 inches deep to carbonates. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Justesen soils are on gently sloping to steep alluvial fans, fan terraces, toeslopes, and foothills at elevations of 4,600 to 7,000 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in medium textured alluvium from rhyolite, basalt, and sedimentary rocks. The average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, most of which falls as snow and early spring rains.  The average annual temperature is about 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 70 to 110 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bancroft, Carey Lake, Drage, Goodington, and McCarey soils.  Bancroft soils have less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand in the particle-size control section.  Carey Lake soils lack a calcic horizon.  Drage soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Goodington soils have more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  McCarey soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  McCarey and Goodington soils are on basalt plains. Drage soils are on alluvial fans associated with metasedimentary parent material. Carey Lake and Bancroft soils are on the same landscape. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for rangeland, with some irrigated pastureland and hayland.  Vegetation is basin big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Thurber's needlegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southcentral Idaho and central Utah.  This series is of limited extent.
