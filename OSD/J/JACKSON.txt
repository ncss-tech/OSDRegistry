JACKSON SERIES

The Jackson series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed mostly in silty alluvium underlain  by stratified sandy alluvium.  These soils are on stream terraces and lake terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 9 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jackson silt loam, on a 2 percent slope, in a cultivated field, at an elevation of about 780 feet above sea level.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 9 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak medium granular; friable; many fine roots; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (6 to 10 inchesthick)

 Bt1--9 to 15 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) silt loam; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine roots; few faint brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary.

 Bt2--15 to 24 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) silt loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine roots; common faint brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; moderately acid; clear irregular boundary.

 Bt3--24 to 34 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) silt loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine roots; few faint brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary.

 Bt4--34 to 50 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silt loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine roots; few faint dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) clay films on faces of peds; common coarse faint brown (10YR 5/3) and common fine prominent yellowish red 5YR 4/6) masses of iron accumulation in the matrix; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizon ranges from 30 to 54 inches.)

 3C--50 to 60 inches; stratified brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) fine sand with thin strata of yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loamy fine sand; single grain; loose; slightly acid.

TYPE LOCATION: Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) 105-Northern Mississippi Valley Loess Hills; Jackson County, Wisconsin subset; about 2 miles east of North Bend; about 2600 feet north and 100 feet east of the southwest corner of section 26, T. 19 N., R. 6 W. USGS North Bend, Wis. Quad. Latitude - 44 degrees 5 minutes 57 seconds N. Longitude - 91 degrees 4 minutes 19 seconds W., NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon, thickness of the silty mantle, and depth to sandy alluvium all range from 40 to 60 inches. The particle-size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay. The content of fine sand or coarser is less than 15 percent in the silty mantle. Carbonates are absent to 80 inches or more. Rock fragments are absent in the silty mantle and the content of gravel ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the sandy alluvium. Reaction commonly ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid throughout the pedon but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed. Redox accumulations occur within 72 inches and commonly occur within 40 inches. Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less are in the lower part of the series control section in some pedons. Saturation occurs at a depth of 40 to 72 inches for 1 month or more per year in 6 or more out of 10 years. In many pedons, saturation occurs within 40 inches for less than 1 month per year or less than 6 out of 10 years, or both.

The Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Where moist value is 3, dry value is 6 or more. Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture of the Ap or A horizon is silt loam.

Some pedons have an E horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam.

The Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam

Some pedons have a 2Bt horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together. Texture is typically stratified dominantly with silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam and has thin strata of coarser texture. In some pedons it is not stratified.

The 3C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is stratified fine sand, sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand. Thin strata of finer texture are in some pedons.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bertrand, Blackhammer, Camden, Dodge, Dubuque, Fayette, Flagg, Greenridge, Hackers, Jermerson, Knowles, La Farge, Lambeau, Lomira, Martinsburg, Menfro, Middletown, Navlys, Palmero, Palsgrove, Pepin, Picasaw, Ridgway, Rozzetta, Ruma, Rush, Russell, Seaton, St. Charles, Stookey, Sylvan, Thebes,  and Yellowriver series. Bertrand, Lambeau, Middletown, Ridgway, Rush, and Thebes soils do not have redox features and saturation in the lower part of the series control section. Blackhammer, Camden, Dodge, Fayette, Flagg, Greenridge, Hackers, Jemerson, Lomira, Martinsburg, Menfro, Navlys, Palermo, Pepin, Piscasaw, Rozetta, Ruma, Russell, Seaton, Stookey, Sylvan, and Yellowriver soils average less than 80 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section.Dubuque and Knowles soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. La Farge soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Palsgrove soils have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches. St. Charles soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on stream terraces and lake terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent. These soils formed mostly in silty alluvium underlain by stratified sandy alluvium. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 51 degrees F. The frost free period ranges from about 135 to 160 days. Elevation ranges from 700 to 1100 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bertrand, Curran, and Tell soils.
Bertrand--are at slightly higher landscape positions and do not have a frequently saturated zone within a depth of 1.8 meters during the wettest periods of normal years
Curran--are at slightly lower landscape positions and have a frequently saturated zone within a depth of 0.3 meter during the wettest periods of normal years
Tell--are at slightly higher landscape positions and have a sand content of more than 15 percent within a depth of 100 centimeters

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  
Moderately well drained. These soils have an apparent seasonal high water table at a depth of 3.5 to 6 feet for 1 month or more per year in 6 or more out of 10 years. The potential for surface runoff ranges from negligible to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the silty mantle and high in the sandy alluvium. Permeability is moderate in the silty mantle and rapid in the sandy alluvium. Some areas are rarely flooded for brief duration.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used for cropland. Common crops are corn, small grain, and hay.  Some areas are used for woodland and pastureland.  Native vegetation is mixed hardwood forest.  Common trees are northern red oak, black oak, white ash, white oak, black walnut, and quaking aspen.
