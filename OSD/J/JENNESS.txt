JENNESS SERIES



The Jenness series consists of very deep, well drained soils on

bottomlands, low terraces, and alluvial fans.  They formed in alluvium

and colluvium from acid igneous rocks.  Permeability is moderate.

Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about

10 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, nonacid, mesic Xeric Torriorthents

Torriorthents.



TYPICAL PEDON:  Jenness loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil

unless otherwise noted.)



    Ap--0 to 5 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, dark

grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak very fine granular structure;

slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common

fine roots; many very fine pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth

boundary.  (2 to 9 inches thick)



    C1--5 to 25 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, dark

grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular structure;

slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common

fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt

smooth boundary.  (17 to 50 inches thick)



    2C2--25 to 40 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam, dark brown

(10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly

sticky; few fine roots; few very fine pores; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt

smooth boundary.  (0 to 25 inches thick)



    2C3--40 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) strata of loam and

sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; few fine roots; neutral

(pH 7.0).



TYPE LOCATION:  Gem County, Idaho; about 10 miles west of Emmett; SW1/4

SW1/4 SW1/4 section 15, T. 6 N., R. 3 W.



RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:



Average annual soil temperature - 49 to 54 degrees F

Texture in control section - L, SIL, SL

Reaction in profile - neutral to moderately alkaline



Ap horizon

Value - 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist

Chroma - 2 through 4

C1 horizon

Hue - 10YR or 2.5Y

Texture - Strata of SIL, L, SL, GR-SL or GR-LS are common below 30

inches



COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Lolalita and Luckyrich series.

Lolalita soils are dominantly coarse sandy loam or sandy loam in the 10

to 40 inch control section.  Luckyrich soils have average annual soil

temperature of 54 to 59 degrees F.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jenness soils are on bottomlands and very low

terraces along small intermittent streams, very gently to steeply

sloping alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  Elevations

range from 2,000 to 4,000 feet.  The soil formed in micaceous, recent

local alluvium and colluvium from acid and intermediate igneous rocks.

The average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches, including 1 to 2

feet of snow.  Average annual temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The

frost-free period is 110 to 160 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chilcott, Elijah,

Lanktree, Power, and Purdam soils.  All of these soils have argillic

horizons.  Chilcott, Elijah, Lanktree, and Purdam soils are on higher

terraces.  Power soils are on similar landscapes.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well-drained; slow to very rapid runoff;

moderate permeability.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for rangeland and irrigated cropland.  Small

grains, corn, sugar beets, alfalfa, and improved pasture are grown on

irrigated land.  Vegetation in the potential natural plant community is

sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, Thurber

needlegrass, and giant wildrye.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Idaho.  The series is moderately

extensive.
