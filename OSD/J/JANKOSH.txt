JANKOSH SERIES 

The Jankosh series consists of somewhat poorly drained loamy alluvial soils that are moderately deep over gravelly sand on river valley floodplains. Permeability is moderate in the loamy upper part and very rapid in the gravelly lower part.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is 17 inches at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquic Natrustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jankosh loam 0 to 2 percent slopes in native grass. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  E--2 to 4 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable; slight effervescence; slightly alkaline; sodium adsorption ratio 5; abrupt smooth boundary (1/2 to 4 inches thick).

  Btn--4 to 14 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy clay loam; dark grayish dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; violent effervescence; very strongly alkaline; sodium adsorption ratio 19; clear smooth boundary.

(Combined thickness of the Btn horizon is 5 to 24 inches.)

  Bkn2--18 to 33 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very fine sandy loam; pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure; slightly hard, friable; few fine and medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) irregularly shaped masses of iron accumulation with sharp to diffuse boundaries in the matrix; sodium adsorption ratio 15; few fine calcium carbonate accumulations; violent effervescence; very strongly alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary.  (10 to 20 inches) 

  2Cg--33 to 80 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) gravelly coarse sand; light gray (10YR 7/2) moist; single grain; loose; 26 percent gravel by volume; neutral.

COMPETING SERIES:
There are no other series in the same family.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: derived from loamy alluvium deposited 25 to 48 inches deep over sandy and gravelly alluvium
Landform:

Mean annual temperature: 49 to 51 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 14 to 18 inches
Frost-free period: 130 to 150 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Janise do not have coarse sand or gravelly sand at depths below 20 inches
Lemoyne: are sandy over loamy and are not strongly alkaline
Lewellen: are sandy in the particle size control section
McCuligan: are sandy in the particle size control section, have a higher seasonal high water table and are slightly lower on the landscape
McGrew:  are not strongly alkaline
Minatare: are fine textured and have an argillic horizonRushcreek: are deep and moderately alkaline
Platte: have coarce sand and gravelly coarce sand above 20 inches 
Yockey: are not strongly alkaline

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage: somewhat poorly drained
Permeability: moderate in the loamy upper part and very rapid in the gravelly lower part  
Flooding: rare flooding may occur for brief durations
Runoff: slow

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for range or hayland.  Native vegetation is principally alkali sacation, inland saltgrass, western wheatgrass, slender wheatgrass and plains bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nebraska, and possibly eastern Wyoming and northeastern Colorado.  The series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Garden County, Nebraska, 1994.

REMARKS:   
Diagnostic features recognized in this pedon are:  
Ochric epipedon: the zone from 0 to 2 inches (A horizon)
Albic horizon: the zone from 2 to 4 inches (E horizon)
Argilic horizon: the zone from 4 to 18 inches (Btn and Bkn horizons) 
Aquic soil conditions: the zone from 14 to 33 inches (Bkn horizons) 
In areas that are used for cultivated crops the A, E, and the upper Btn horizons have been mixed by plowing.Some pedons have a C horizon that is similar in color and texture to the Bkn horizon. It may be stratified in color and texture. Jankosh soils were previously mapped as Janise, sandy substratum or an alkali phase of the Gering series.
