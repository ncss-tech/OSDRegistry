JONDA SERIES  

The Jonda series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium weathered from tuff.  These soils are on mountains  and have slopes of 5 to 45 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Xerollic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jonda gravelly loam - rangeland.  On a northwest-facing  convex slope of 2 percent at 7,100 feet elevation.  (Colors are for dry  soil unless otherwise noted.  This profile was dry when described on  October 1, 1980.)  

    A--0 to 4 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly loam; very dark  grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly  hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very  fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 1 percent stones, 3 percent cobbles, 30 percent  pebbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 6 inches  thick)  

    Bt1--4 to 16 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) extremely cobbly  clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) moist; moderate fine  subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic, many very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; 50 percent cobbles, 25 percent pebbles, 1 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 12  inches thick)  

    Bt2--16 to 21 inches; yellow (10YR 7/6) extremely cobbly clay loam;  brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky  structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic;  common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; few faint clay  films on rock surfaces and faces of peds; 50 percent cobbles, 30 percent pebbles, 1 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 5 inches thick)  

    Bk1--21 to 40 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) extremely cobbly  sandy loam; yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard,  very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine  roots; 50 percent cobbles, 30 percent pebbles, 1 percent stones; slightly effervescent;  moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear irregular boundary.  (3 to 19  inches thick)  

    Bk2--40 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/4) extremely cobbly  sandy loam; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; weak fine  subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and slightly  plastic; few very fine roots; 50 percent cobbles, 30 percent pebbles, 1 percent stones;  slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Buffmeyer, Condie, Guiser, Judkins, Mulgon,  Namon, Rocko, Scandard, Tamred, Timberlin and Wapshilla series.  All of these soils lack carbonates.  Also, Judkins, Namon, Scandard, Tamred and Timberlin soils have a lithic  contact at a depth of 20 and 40 inches.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jonda soils formed in mixed slope alluvium and colluvium on  northwest-facing convex mountain and foothill slopes.  Slopes range  from 5 to 45 percent.  The average annual precipitation is from 12 to  16 inches.  Elevation ranges from 6,000 to 7,500 feet.  The climate is  subhumid with cold moist winters and cool summers.  The average temperature is 39 to 42 degrees F.  The frost-free  season is 50 to 70 days.  

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brabas, Challis,  Frailton, Gelkie, Klug, and Zeebar soils.  Brabas soils have more than  35 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Challis and Frailton soils  lack an argillic horizon and have a warmer average summer soil  temperature.  Gelkie, Klug, and Zeebar soils have a mollic epipedon.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderately slow permeability;  slow to very rapid runoff.  

USE AND VEGETATION:  Jonda soils are primarily used for livestock grazing.  Vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, low and black sagebrush, bluebunch  wheatgrass, and Sandberg bluegrass.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central and southeast Idaho.  This series is  small in extent.
