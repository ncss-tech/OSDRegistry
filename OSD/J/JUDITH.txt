JUDITH SERIES

The Judith series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvium or colluvium derived mainly from limestone.  These soils are on stream terraces, fan remnants, and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Reconnaissance Soil Survey of Central Montana, 1946.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation records:  MT0104, MT0145, MT1075, MT0718, MT0219.  

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon - from the soil surface to 9 inches (Ap, Bw horizons)
Calcic horizon - from 9 to 83 inches (Bk1, Bk2, 2Bk3, 2Bk4 horizons)
Particle-size control section - from 10 to 40 inches (Bk1, Bk2, and part of the 2Bk3 horizon).  

Judith soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.

The 1/2013 description reflects a correction to gravel content in the 2Bk3 horizon.  The OSD typical pedon listed 65 percent gravel while the original description from Fergus County reflected 50 percent gravel.  The Judith series should be investigated in the future to determine whether it is typically fine-loamy or loamy-skeletal.
