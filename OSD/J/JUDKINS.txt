JUDKINS SERIES

The Judkins series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from rhyolite and closely related bedrock.  Judkins soils are on uplands and have slopes of 1 to 80 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.   The mean annual precipitation is about 510 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 2 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Buffmeyer, Condie, Guiser, Jonda(T), Mulgon, Namon, Rocko (T), Scandard (T), Tamred, Timberlin, Wapshilla and Washboard (T) series. All of these soils except Scandard, Tamred and Timberlin are deeper than 100 cm to any bedrock. Buffmeyer soils have gravelly sandy loam Bt horizons. Condie soils have Bt horizons with hue of 5YR through 10R.  Guiser soils have average annual soil temperature of 42 to 47 degrees F.  Jonda soils have a calcic horizon at 25 to 53 cm.  Mulgon soils have hues of 7.5YR or 5YR in the Bt.  Namon soils have Bt horizons of very cobbly very fine sandy loam to very cobbly heavy sandy loam.  Scandard soils have hue of 10R to 5YR in the argillic horizon.  Tamred soils have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR in the argillic horizon and lack E horizons.  Wapshilla soils lack E horizons.  Timberlin soils are over interbedded shale and sandstone, shale material is paralithic, sandstone is lithic and rock fragments are primarily flagstones.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Judkins soils are on northerly slopes in uplands. Slopes range from 1 to 80 percent but are dominantly 30 to 65 percent. The soils formed in residuum and slope alluvium weathered from rhyolite, rhyolitic tuff, or latite. In some places the upper horizons contain an admixture of loess. Elevations are 1675 to 2125 meters. The climate is cool subhumid continental, having fairly dry late summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 460 to 760 millimeters. The annual temperature is 1 degrees to 4 degrees C.  Frost-free season is about 30 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Lantonia, Rammel, Tetonia, and Turnerville soils. Lantonia, Tetonia, and Turnerville soils are nonstony and are deeper than 150 cm to bedrock. Rammel soils contain less than 50 percent rock fragments in the Bt horizon, has a mollic epipedon, and has Bk horizons above depth of 100 cm.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mostly for range and timber. Vegetation is mainly lodgepole pine, Douglas-fir, scattered aspen, pine reedgrass, dwarf huckleberry, Oregon grape, lichens, and wild rose.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho and western Wyoming.  The soils are inextensive.
