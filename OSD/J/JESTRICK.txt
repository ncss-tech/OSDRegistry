JESTRICK SERIES

The Jestrick series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in eolian and alluvial deposits.  Jestrick soils are on basalt plains and have slopes of 0 to 12 percent.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Haplodurids 

TYPICAL PEDON: Jestrick loamy fine sand on a 2.5 percent slightly convex north facing slope at an elevation of 3,300 feet in rangeland.  When described on October 14, 1986 the soil was dry throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 1 inch; brown (10YR 5/3) loamy fine sand, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak very fine and fine granular structure; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; about 2 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 5 inches thick)

    A2--1 to 5 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loamy fine sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium and coarse platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; about 2 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 7 inches thick)

    Bw--5 to 16 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; about 3 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)

    Bkq--16 to 22 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) cobbly fine sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; about 5 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; about 25 percent very hard when dry and firm when moist cemented nodules; strongly effervescent (about 15 percent calcium carbonate); lime and silica coatings up to 1mm thick on undersides of rock fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (6 to 8 inches thick)

    2Bkqm--22 to 29 inches; white (10YR 8/2) indurated duripan, gray (10YR 6/2) moist; starting at 22 inches is a series of continuous laminar caps less than one millimeter thick; these laminar caps are spaced 0.5 to 2 inches apart and the material between them is strongly cemented to indurated; few very fine and fine roots matted on top of the laminar cap; about 10 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles cemented in the duripan; abrupt wavy boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

    3R--29 inches; basalt- continuous lime-silica cemented laminar cap 1 to 2mm thick on top of the basalt.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Doel, Oupico, Shalake, Skull Creek, Tauncal and Taunton soils.  Doel, Oupico, Shalake, Skull Creek, and Taunton soils lack bedrock within a depth of 25 to 40 inches.  Tauncal soils lack bedrock at depth of 25 to 40 inches and are calcareous throughout.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jestrick soils occur on basalt plains. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  Elevation ranges from 3,200 to 4,000 feet.  The Jestrick soils formed in eolian and alluvial material derived from mixed sources.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 11 inches, most of which falls as snow and early spring rain.  The average annual air temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free season is 100 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the (t) Fathom, (t) Ackley, Kecko, (t) Chijer, Quincy, the competing  Taunton, (t) Wako, and the (t) Wendell soils.  Ackley, Wako, and Wendell soils have argillic horizons.  Kecko and Chijer soils lack duripans above 40 inches.  Fathom and Quincy soils have sandy particle size control sections, and are very deep.  Taunton soils lack bedrock above 40 inches, and are well drained.  All of these soils occur on basalt plains near the Jestrick soil.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; slow runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for irrigated cropland.  Crops include barley, wheat, potatoes, sugar beets, corn, and hay.  Small areas are used for rangeland.  Vegetation consists of basin big sagebrush, Indian ricegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Thurber needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION and EXTENT:  Jestrick soils are inextensive in south central Idaho.
