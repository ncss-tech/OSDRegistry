JENNETT SERIES

The Jennett series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from basalt and tuff.  Jennett soils are on drainageways and depressions on plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  At present, there are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jennett soils are on drainageways and depressions on plateaus.  These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from basalt and tuff.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  Elevations range from 4,700 to 4,900 feet.  The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, wet winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 19 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F., mean January temperature is 25 to 28 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is 60 to 65 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Casebeer, Dranket, and Norcross soils.  Casebeer and Norcross are clayey, shallow to duripans over bedrock, and have argillic horizons.  Dranket soils are fine, moderately deep to duripans over bedrock, do not have aquic conditions, and have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; medium surface runoff; slow permeability.  Endosaturation is present with a seasonal high water table between 10 and 20 inches (shallow internal free water occurrence class) from December to May.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  During summer months in normal years a zone of saturation is not present.  These soils receive run-on moisture.  Soils on less than 1 percent slope on depressions are frequently ponded for long duration, mainly in the late winter and spring.  Soils with 1 percent slope on drainageways have brief or very brief periods of flooding, especially after intense rainfall events.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Jennett soils are used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  The native vegetation is silver sagebrush and Nevada bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Oregon.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 21.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California.

SERIES PROPOSED:  Klamath County (Gerber Block of Fremont National Forest Area), Oregon, 1997.  The name is from a spring in the area.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
