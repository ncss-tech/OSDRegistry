JUPITER SERIES

The Jupiter series consists of shallow and very shallow, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in a thin bed of sandy marine sediments overlying limestone bedrock. Jupiter soils are on flatwoods, low broad flats, low hammocks, and drainageways on marine terraces. Slopes are linear to slightly convex and range from 0 to 2 percent.  Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 1524 millimeters (60 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 23 degrees C (74 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, siliceous, hyperthermic Lithic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jupiter fine sand, in a native forest at elevation of about 12.5 meters (41 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil.)

   Ap--0 to 23 centimeters (0 to 9 inches); black (N 2/0) fine sand; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many fine and medium roots; many uncoated sand grains; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. [13 to 25 centimeters (5 to 10 inches) thick] 

   A--23 to 28 centimeters (9 to 11 inches); black (N 2/0) fine sand; weak fine granular structure; very friable; few medium and fine roots; many fine and medium distinct dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) depletions and streaks, few coarse distinct light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) depletions; neutral; clear wavy boundary. [5 to 20 centimeters (2 to 8 inches) thick] 

   Cg--28 to 36 centimeters (11 to 14 inches); light gray (10YR 7/1) fine sand; single grain; loose; few fine roots; few fine distinct black (10YR 2/1) organic material or masses in thin root mat at contact with limestone; slightly alkaline; abrupt irregular boundary. [0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches) thick] 

   2R--36 to 61 centimeters (14 to 24 inches); hard fractured limestone bedrock containing solution holes filled with marl and brownish fine sand.

TYPE LOCATION:  Hendry County, Florida; about 0.8 kilometers (0.5 miles) south of the intersection of Schultz Grade and Dump Road; about 2,595 feet south and 945 feet west (791 meters south and 288 meters west) of the Northeast corner of sec. 21, T. 48 S., R. 31 E.; Latitude and Longitude; 26 degrees, 17 minutes, 26.21 seconds, north; and 81 degrees, 13 minutes, 25.62 seconds, west; WGS84.

2R horizon:
The underlying hard limestone is fractured limestone bedrock.  This limestone consists mostly of large flat plates with fractures between plates ranging from less than 2 to 10 centimeters (1 to 4 inches) or more wide. Solution holes in plates range from about 10 to 91 centimeters (4 inches to 3 feet) in diameter.  The fractures and solution holes occur at about 61 to 183 centimeters (2 to 6 feet) intervals.  Light gray to yellowish brown sand, sandy loam, marl, or mixed sand and marl occurs discontinuously in the solution holes.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
Boca soils have argillic horizons, have limestone bedrock at depths of 51 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) and are on slightly higher landform positions.
Felda soils lack limestone bedrock, have argillic horizons and are on slightly higher landform positions. 
Hallandale soils lack mollic epipedons and are on similar landform positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:

Ponding: 0 to 30 centimeters (0 to 12 inches) in undrained areas, for long periods 7 to 30 days

USE AND VEGETATION:  
Under natural conditions Jupiter soils are used for water quality and wildlife habitat, some areas are used for range.
Potential native vegetation consists of cabbage palm, laurel oak, water oak, scattered south Florida slash pine, red mulberry, and redbay with an understory of marlberry, waxmyrtle, wild coffee, greenbriars, ferns, longleaf uniola, Eastern gamagrass, chalky bluestem, maidencane, and switchgrass.  The wetter area vegetation is dominated by cabbage palm, pond cypress, red maple, dahoon holly, water oak, and strangler fig with an understory of pickerelweed, arrowhead, ferns, swamp dogwood, lizards tail, maidencane, and switchgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
