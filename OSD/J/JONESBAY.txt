JONESBAY SERIES

The Jonesbay series consists of very deep, subaqueous (permanently submersed), moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity soils that formed in loamy estuarine deposits. These nearly level soils occur on lagoon bottoms and estuarine tidal streams of estuaries. Slope is less than 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1295 mm (51 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 20.6 degrees C (69 degrees F).

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES PROPOSED: Brazoria County, Texas, 2022. The name is coined from Jones Bay near Tiki Island, Texas that has these types of soils.

REMARKS: The series was formerly included with water. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
  Particle-size control section: 25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in) 
  Sulfidic materials: 0 to 78 cm (0 to 31 in) (Aseg horizon and Cseg layer)
  N value greater than 7: 0 to 172 cm (0 to 68 in) (Aseg horizon, Cseg layer, Cg1 layer)

Additional Comments: Mineralogy based on data from adjacent subaerial soils and the content of shell fragments that make up the sand portion. 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Soil survey office lab data on pedon S2021TX0399148 from series type location.
