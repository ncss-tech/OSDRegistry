JAYEL SERIES 

The Jayel series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from serpentinized peridotite. Jayel soils are on mountain and broad ridges and have slopes of 5 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 2670 millimeters (105 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, parasesquic, mesic Typic Dystroxerepts

(13 to 30 centimeters thick) 

 BA--28 to 48 centimeters (11 to 19 inches); yellowish red (5YR 4/6) stony clay, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine, common fine, few medium and coarse roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual smooth boundary. (13 to 76 centimeters thick) 

 Bw--48 to 81 centimeters (19 to 32 inches); yellowish red (5YR 4/6) stony clay, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine, common fine, few medium and coarse roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel and 10 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (18 to 76 centimeters thick) 

 R--81 centimeters (32 inches); fractured peridotite; fractures 25 to 50 cm apart. 

TYPE LOCATION: Del Norte County, California; off Low Divide Road approximately 0.8 mile south of the junction with Rowdy Creek Road, pit exposure about 43 feet upslope from road; NE1/4, NE1/4 sec. 34, T.18N, R.1E, HBLM. USGS High Divide Quadrangle.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture: The soil is usually dry in all parts from June 15 to October 15 and moist in all parts from November 15 to April 15. The soils have a xeric moisture regime.

Soil temperature: The mean annual soil temperature is 10 to 15 degrees C (50 to 59 degrees F). The difference between mean summer and mean winter temperature is 6 to 10 degrees C.

The ratio of Fe203 plus gibbsite to clay ranges from 0.2 to 0.7.

Surface stones range from 0 to 30 percent.

COMPETING SERIES: At this time there are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Jayel soils are on mountain slopes and broad ridges. Slopes are 5 to 75 percent. Elevations are 55 to 1148 meters (180 to 3500 feet). The soils formed in material weathered from serpentinized peridotite. The climate is humid with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 2290 to 3050 millimeters (90 to 120 inches). Mean January temperature is 3 degrees C (37 degrees F.), and mean July temperature is 17 degrees C (63 degrees F.). Mean annual temperature is 10 to 15 degrees C (50 to 59 degrees F). Frost-free season is estimated to be about 140 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Gasquet, Oragran, Walnett, and Weitchepec soils. The Gasquet soils are fine-loamy. The Weitchepec soils are 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) to a lithic contact. Oragran soils are 20 to 50 centimeters (10 to 20 inches) to a lithic contact. Walnett soils are greater than 152 centimeters to a lithic contact. Gasquet and Walnett soils are in concave to linear positions and are on more stable positions on mountain slopes. Oragran and Weitchepec soils are on convex to strongly convex positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; high runoff; moderately low to low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for recreation, watershed, wildlife habitat, and mineral resources. Native vegetation is knobcone pine, annual grasses, red and California evergreen huckleberry, tanoak, huckleberry oak, California coffeeberry, azalea, California bay, and some sugar pine and Douglas-fir. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern California. The series is moderately extensive.
