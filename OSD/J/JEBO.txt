JEBO SERIES

The Jebo series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in colluvium derived mainly from sandstone or conglomerate composed of sandstone, limestone, and quartzite rocks.  These soils are on foothills and mountain slopes and have slopes of 15 to 40 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F., and average annual precipitation is about 15 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jebo very gravelly loam, on a 40 percent, slightly convex, west facing slope in rangeland.  When described the soil was moist to about 12 inches, and dry below.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 10 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) very gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) dry; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; common very fine and a few fine roots; 30 percent gravel; 10 percent cobble; slightly calcareous, carbonates are disseminated; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (7 to 18 inches thick)

    Bw--10 to 16 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) very gravelly loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine pores; 30 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 11 inches thick)

    Bk1--16 to 24 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very cobbly loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, many very fine pores; 35 percent gravel, 25 percent cobble; strongly calcareous, carbonates are disseminated; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (5 to 9 inches thick)

    Bk2--24 to 35 inches; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) extremely cobbly sandy loam, pink (7.5YR 7/4) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine pores; 45 percent gravel; 25 percent cobble; strongly calcareous, carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt irregular boundary.  (0 to 11 inches thick)

    R--35 inches; fractured conglomerate.

TYPE LOCATION:  Rich County, Utah; 1 mile west and 6 miles south of Meadowville; 1,700 feet east and 2,100 feet south of the NW corner of Section 29, T. 12 N., R. 5 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 20 inches thick.  The thickness of the solum and the depth to free carbonates typically is about 18 inches but range from 13 to 20 inches.  Rock fragments in the 10 to 40 inch depth are rounded, and range from 40 to 65 percent gravel and 0 to 20 percent cobble.  Depth to the bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 37 to 44 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F.  The soil is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 or more consecutive days within the 4 months following the summer solstice.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist.  Rock fragment content is about 40 percent with 30 to 40 percent as gravel and 0 to 10 percent as cobble.  The A horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline, and noncalcareous or slightly calcareous.

The Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.  Rock fragment content ranges from 35 to 60 percent, with 30 to 60 percent as gravel and 0 to 15 percent as cobble.  Clay content is 15 to 22 percent. The Bw horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline, and noncalcareous to moderately calcareous.

The Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 4 dry, 4 to 6 moist.  It ranges from very cobbly loam or extremely cobbly sandy loam to extremely gravelly loam or extremely gravelly sandy loam.  Rock fragment content is 35 to 60 percent, with 30 to 55 percent as gravel and 0 to 40 percent as cobble. Clay content is 10 to 15 percent.  The Bk horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Buist, Cooley, Dagan, Hondoho, Niarada, and Tuckerdowns series.
These soils do not have a lithic contact within 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jebo soils are on foothills and mountain ridges.  Slopes range from 15 to 40 percent.  These soil formed in colluvium derived from sandstone or conglomerate composed of sandstone, limestone, and quartzite.  Elevations range from 6,000 to 8,000 feet.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 35 to 42 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is from 12 to 18 inches.  Freeze-free period is 50 to 85 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Falula (T), Lucky Star, Thatcher, Solak (T), Vanni (T), and the competing Dagan soils.  Falula soils are shallow over bedrock.  Lucky Star soils are more than 60 inches deep and are on north aspects under aspens.  Thatcher soils are more than 60 inches deep and have argillic horizons.  Solak soils are shallow over bedrock.  Vanni soils are very deep and are carbonates.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; rapid runoff; moderately permeable.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for rangeland.  Principal vegetation is bluebunch wheatgrass, big sagebrush, muttongrass and bitterbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The soils of this series are moderately extensive in northeastern Utah and southeastern Idaho. LRR E, MLRA 47.
