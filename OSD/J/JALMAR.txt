JALMAR SERIES

The Jalmar series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils. These soils formed in sandy and loamy eolian deposits from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. Jalmar soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping plains and interdunes. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 406 mm (16 in), and mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C. (61 degrees F).

Douro soils are on slightly lower landscape positions and have a petrocalcic horizon.
Penwell soils are on higher landscape positions and do not have an argillic horizon.
Ratliff soils are on similar landscape positions and have a calcic horizon between 50 and 102 cm (20 and 40 in); in addition these soils do not have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained and moderate permeability. Runoff is negligible on less than 1 percent slopes, low on 1 to 5 percent slopes, and medium on 5 to 8 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used almost entirely for rangeland. Climax vegetation is tall and mid grasses, with tall grasses tending to dominate. This site is dominated by little and sand bluestem along with taller dropseed species. The remainder is mid and short grasses such as sideoats grama, mesa dropseed, sand dropseed, hooded windmillgrass, sand lovegrass, sand paspalum, fall witchgrass, hairy grama, needle and thread, and perennial threeawn. Sand sage, shinoak, and yucca are also present. This soil has been correlated to the Sandy (R077DY046TX) ecological site in MLRA-77D.
 
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern High Plains, Southern Part (MLRA 77D in LRR H) of western Texas and eastern New Mexico. The series is extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Andrews County, Texas; 1970.

REMARKS: The Jalmar series was formerly included in the Brownfield series. Classification change from Arenic Ustollic Haplargids to Arenic Ustic Haplargids made due to changes in Soil Taxonomy. Classification is based on Lincoln Laboratory data (S85TX-003-001) from a site near the type location in Andrews County, Texas.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric (Arenic) epipedon: 0 to 76 cm (0 to 30 in) A and E horizons.
Argillic horizon: 76 to 203 cm (30 to 80 in) Bt horizons.
