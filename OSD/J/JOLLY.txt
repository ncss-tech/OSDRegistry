JOLLY SERIES


The Jolly series consists of shallow soils over sandstone bedrock.  These well drained, moderately permeable soils that developed in residuum and colluvium from sandstone.  These soils are on gently sloping to strongly sloping ridges on hills.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 737mm (29 in) and the mean annual air temperature is 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, siliceous, active, thermic, shallow Typic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Jolly fine sandy loam--Rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

 A--0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 in); brown (7.5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; loose, very friable; many fine and medium roots; sandstone fragments up to 36 inches across cover about 5 percent of the surface; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. Thickness is 5 to 23 cm (2 to 9 in) thick.

 Bt--13 to 28 cm (5 to 11 in); reddish brown (5YR 5/4) sandy clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; very hard, very firm; many fine and medium roots; many fine and medium pores; common continuous clay films on surfaces of peds; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. Thickness is 8 to 36 cm (3 to 14 in) thick.

 Btc--28 to 46 cm (11 to 18 in), reddish brown (5YR 5/4) paragravelly sandy clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, firm; many fine and medium roots; few medium pores; common thin patchy clay films on surfaces of peds; common medium black concretions; 30 percent discontinuous layers of soft sandstone parafragments less than 3 inches across; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. Thickness is 0 to 33 cm (0 to 13 in) thick.

 Cr--46 to 102 cm (18 to 40 in); pale yellow (5Y 7/3) weakly cemented sandstone bedrock, pale olive (5Y 6/3) moist; few coarse yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) mottles and streaks; common black streaks; neutral.

TYPE LOCATION: Archer County, Texas; from the intersection of Texas Highways 25 and 79 in Archer City; about 5.25 miles north on Texas Highway 79; 0.72 mile west northwest on a ranch road; then 75 feet south in rangeland. USGS Topographic Quadrangle: Archer City NE, TX; Latitude 33 degrees 40 minutes 59.76 minutes N; Longitude 98 degrees 37 minutes 1.38 seconds W, NAD 1983; UTM Easting 535495, UTM Northing 3727104, UTM Zone 14.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Depth to bedrock: 30 to 51 cm (12 to 20 in)
Surface fragments: 0 to 10 percent; gravel, cobbles, or stones with a few outcrops of sandstone bedrock

Particle-size control section (weighted average)
  Clay content: 20 to 30 percent 
  Coarse fragments: 0 to 30 percent; partially weathered sandstone gravel, cobbles, or flagstones

A horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 4
Texture: fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam
Reaction: ranges from moderately acid to neutral.

Bt horizon:
Hue: 5YR or 7.5YR
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 4
Texture: dominantly sandy clay loam, but fine sandy loam may occur in the lower part.
Clay content: 15 to 30 percent
Coarse fragments: 0 to 15 percent in the Bt horizon and 10 to 45 percent by volume in the Btc horizon of soft sandstone parafragments less than 8 cm (3 in) across as discontinuous layers.
Reaction: slightly acid or neutral

Cr Horizon:
Hue: 10YR to 5Y
Value: 6 to 8
Chroma: 1 to 6
Mottles: some pedons have coarse reddish and brownish mottles and black streaks
Cementation:  extremely weakly to moderately cemented 
Bedrock: noncalcareous, horizontally layered sandstone. In some pedons the sandstone bedrock below a depth of 40 inches is strongly cemented or noncemented.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no series in the same family. Similar soils include the Bluegrove, Bonti, Cosh, Darnell, Exray, and Pontotoc series.
Bluegrove, Bonti, and Pontotoc soils: are more than 51 cm (20 in)deep to bedrock. 
Cosh and Exray soils: have argillic horizons redder than 5YR and moist values less than 4, and in addition, Exray soils have more that 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.
Darnell soils: do not have an argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: fine and medium grained residuum and colluvium derived from sandstone of Permian and Pennsylvanian age
Landscape: hills
Landform: plane or convex side slopes of ridges
Slope: 1 to 12 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 686 to 813 mm (27 to 32 in)
Thornthwaite annual P-E index: 40 to 50
Mean annual air temperature: 17.2 to 18.9 degrees C (63 to 66 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 210 to 240 days
Elevation: 304.8 to 487.7 meters (1,000 to 1,600 feet)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bluegrove, Darnell, Grandfield, Owens, Throck,and Vernon series.
Bluegrove soils: occur on higher ridgetops.
Grandfield soils: are greater than 152 cm (60 in) to bedrock and occur on lower toe slopes.
Owens, Throck, and Vernon soils: have more that 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and occur on back slopes and foot slopes below sandstone outcrops.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderate in the soil and moderately slow in the bedrock. Runoff is very low on 1 to 3 percent slopes, low on 3 to 5 percent slopes, medium on 5 to 10 percent slopes, and high on slopes greater than 10 percent.

USE AND VEGETATION: The principal use is for rangeland. Small acreage has been cultivated in the past but most cultivated areas are now abandoned and returned to rangeland. Native vegetation is mainly little bluestem, sand bluestem, cane bluestem, sideoats grama, vine-mesquite, Arizona cottontop, Texas wintergrass, Wrights threeawn, blue grama and sand dropseed. Mesquite and prickly pear have invaded most areas.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North and North-central Texas; and possibly in southwestern Oklahoma. Most of these soils are across the Central Rolling Red prairies (MLRA 80A) and northeastern Texas North Central Prairies (MLRA 80B). Jolly soils are of moderate extent.
