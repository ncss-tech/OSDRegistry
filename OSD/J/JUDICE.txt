JUDICE SERIES

The Judice series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in clayey sediments on terraces of late Pleistocene age.  These nearly level soils are in broad slightly depressional areas.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1574 mm (62 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, thermic Typic Epiaquerts

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Carl (MO), Laneburg (T-AR), Osage (MO), and Terouge (AR)series in the same family.
Carl soils: have an argillic horizon; limestone-cherty gravel in argillic horizon
Laneburg soils: have an argillic horizon; somewhat poorly drained
Osage soils: in area of cooler mean annual air temperature and less precipitation
Terouge soils: are calcareous throughout

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: clayey fluviomarine deposits of late Pleistocene age
Landscape: flat coastal plains
Landform: broad depressional areas and relic meandering channels 
Slope: 0 to 1 percent but mainly less than 0.5 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 1397 to 1651 mm (55 to 65 in)
Precipitation Pattern: Precipitation is uniform throughout the year with slight peaks during the spring and summer months

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Crowley, Edgerly, Jeanerette, Midland, Morey, Mowata, and Patoutville series.  All of these soils are slightly higher in the landscape.  

Crowley, Midland, Mowata, and Patoutville soils: have an ochric epipedon; argillic horizon.  
Edgerly, Jeanerette, and Morey: are loamy throughout; are associated with Judice soils in the eastern prairies of south Louisiana close to the Mississippi valley.  Crowley, Midland, and Mowata soils are associated with Judice soils in the central and western prairies, while Edgerly soils are associated with Judice soils near the coast.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained.  Permeability is very slow.  Runoff is negligible.  A perched water table is at a depth of about 15 cm to 46 cm (about 0.5 to 1.5 ft) from December to April.  In some areas, these soils are subject to flooding.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for growing rice and for pasture.  Tall grasses and sedges were the dominant native vegetation.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Gulf Coast Prairie of Louisiana and southeast Texas (MLRA 150A, LRR T).  The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lafayette Parish, Louisiana; 1976.

REMARKS:  These soils were previously included in the Beaumont, Jeanerette, and Midland series.  Classification changed 1999 based on Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eighth Edition, 1998.  The classification was changed from Vertic Epiaquolls to Typic Epiaquerts.  With the change in classification the type location also was moved from Lafayette Parish to Jefferson Davis Parish to place in the central part of the series province.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon--0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 in). (Ap horizon.)
Cambic horizon--23 to 203 cm (9 to 80 in). (Bssg horizons.)
Vertisol properties--51 to 203 cm (20 to 80 in). (Bssg horizons) include slickensides, shiny pressure faces and cracks in some years.
