JEVETS SERIES

The Jevets series consists of moderately deep over indurated duripan, well drained soil that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks modified with eolian sands.  Jevets soils are on fan piedmonts and fan skirts.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Typic Haplodurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jevets fine sand--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.

    A1--0 to 3 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 5 cm thick)

    A2--3 to 13 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine, few medium roots; common fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 20 cm thick)

    Bw--13 to 58 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine to medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine, few medium roots; common fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (30 to 48 cm thick)

    Bqk--58 to 69 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) fine sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and medium roots; common fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; discontinuous weakly cemented by silica and carbonates; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (10 to 46 cm thick)

    Bqkm--69 to 102 cm; white (10YR 8/1) indurated duripan, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; very hard; violently effervescent.  (20 to 50 cm thick)

TYPE LOCATION:  Nye County, Nevada; approximately 5 1/2 miles west of Coyotle Hole Well along allotment boundary and about 1000 feet south and 2,200 feet east of the northwest corner of Section 19, T. 2 N., R. 47 E.   latitude 38 degrees, 0 minutes, 48 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 45 minutes 33 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.0134444 latitude, -116.7591667 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture:  Usually dry, moist when not frozen in winter and early spring, and for 10 to 20 days in the upper part during July to September following convectional storms; typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 15 degrees C.
Depth to duripan: 50 to 100 cm.
Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  Averages less than 8 percent.
Rock fragments:  Less than 15 percent.

A horizon 
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3 dry and moist.

Bw horizon
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Structure:  Weak fine and medium subangular blocky or massive.
Texture:  Loamy fine sand or fine sand.
Rock fragments:  0 to 15 percent mainly gravel.

Bqk horizon 
Value: 6 or 7 dry.
Chroma: 2 through 4.
Silica cementation:  Discontinuous weakly cemented some discontinuous strongly cemented laminae.

Bqkm horizon 
Silica cementation:  Many thin continuous indurated laminae.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jevets soils are on fan piedmonts and fan skirts.  These soils formed in alluvium from mixed rocks modified with eolian sands.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 1,525 to 1,895 meters.  The climate is warm and arid.  The mean annual precipitation is 125 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 110 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Stumble and the competing Univega soils.  Stumble soils lack a duripan.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; very slow runoff; very high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing.  The vegetation is principally Douglas Rabbitbrush, littleleaf horsebrush, fourwing saltbush, Nevada dalea and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 29.
