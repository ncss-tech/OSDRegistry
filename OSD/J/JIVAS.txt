JIVAS SERIES

The Jivas series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from mixed volcanic rocks.  Jivas soils are on mountain side slopes.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:   Jivas gravelly loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 15 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong medium and fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 30 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt irregular boundary. (13 to 18 cm thick)

    A2--15 to 30 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 35 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (13 to 18 cm thick)

    Bt1--30 to 46 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; few fine and common very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on ped faces and lining pores; 60 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (13 to 25 cm thick)

    Bt2--46 to 81 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely gravelly sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; few fine and common very fine tubular pores; many faint clay films on ped faces and lining pores; 60 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary. (30 to 50 cm thick)

    Bt3--81 to 114 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; hard very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; few fine and common very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on ped faces and lining pores; 55 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (33 to 40 cm thick)

  R--114 cm; rhyolite

TYPE LOCATION:  Eureka County, Nevada; approximately 10 miles east and 10 miles south of Crescent Valley; about 1,050 feet west and 1,320 feet north of the approximate southeast corner of section 25, T. 28 N., R. 49 E.; USGS Hand-me-down Creek 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude40 degrees 15 minutes 40 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 23 minutes 25 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.2611111 latitude, -116.3902778 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in winter and spring and dry from July through October; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 6 to 8 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 25 to 36 cm, excludes the upper part of the argillic horizon.
Soil thickness and depth to bedrock: 100 to 150 cm.
Argillic horizon thickness: 76 to 117 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 20 to 30 percent.
Rock fragments 60 to 75 percent, mainly gravel.

A horizon
Value 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3.
Structure:  Granular or subangular blocky.

Bt horizons
Value 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 3 or 4.
Texture: extremely gravelly loam, extremely gravelly sandy clay loam, or extremely gravelly clay loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Belate, Burnborough, Closkey, Devils, Gowjai, Granipeak, Millian, Sumine and Torro series. 

Belate and Millan soils are very deep. Burnborough soils have a mollic epipedon that includes the Bt1 horizon and have 35 to 60 percent rock fragments ln the argillic horizon. Closkey, Devils Sumine soils are moderately deep.  Gowjai soils have less than 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Torro soils have an argillic horizon 25 to 60 cm thick and dominantly have angular chert gravel.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jivas soils are on south aspects of mountain side slopes.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from mixed volcanic rocks. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,955 to 2,475 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bregar, Chen, Quarz, and Singletree soils.  Bregar and Chen soils are shallow to bedrock.  Chen and Ouarz soils are clayey-skeletal Singletree soils are fine-loam.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, basin wildrye, antelope bitterbrush, mountain big sagebrush and bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA  25 and 28B.
