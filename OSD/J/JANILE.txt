JANILE SERIES

The Janile series consists of moderately deep, somewhat
excessively drained soils formed in material weathered from
granite.  Janile soils are on mountain sideslopes.  Slopes range
from 30 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Dystric Xerorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Janile bouldery loamy coarse sand, forested, on a S-facing slope of 45 percent under Jeffery pine, black oak and bitterbrush.  (When described, November 3, 1983, the soil was
nearly dry.  Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

Oi--2 to 0 inches; litter of needles, leaves, twigs and cones;
abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 2 inches thick)

A1--0 to 4 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) bouldery loamy coarse
sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 10 percent boulders on the surface; 30 percent pebbles 2 to
5 mm across; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary.

A2--4 to 13 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly
loamy coarse sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; loose, nonsticky and
nonplastic; few very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; many
very fine interstitial pores; 35 percent pebbles 2 to 5 mm across
and 15 percent pebbles 5 to 75 mm across; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary.  (The combined thickness of the A horizons is
3 to 20 inches)

C1--13 to 19 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very
gravelly loamy coarse sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine,
fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine interstitial pores;
few thin colloids in bridges between mineral grains; 25 percent pebbles 2 to 5 mm across and 25 percent pebbles 5 to 75 mm across; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 19 inches
thick)

C2--19 to 24 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine,
fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine interstitial pores;
35 percent pebbles 2 to 5 mm across and 30 percent pebbles 5 to 75
mm across; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 13 inches thick)

Cr--24 inches; weathered granite.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lassen County, California; about 1.1 miles
following a left fork then a right fork along the dirt road which
is westbound from HWY 395 at a point 0.4 mile S of the southern intersection of Lake Crest Road and HWY 395; about 3.1 miles SE of Buntingville; 600 feet N and 2,100 feet W of the SE corner of
section 36, T.28 N., R.13 E. MDBM.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature varies from 47 to 50 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.
These soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section
from July 15 to November 1 (105 days) and
moist in all parts from November 15 to June 1.  The soil
temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from April 1 to December 15 (265 days) and exceeds 47 degrees F from April 15 to December 1.
Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.  Base saturation ranges from
50 to 60 percent by ammonium acetate.  The surface is covered with
0 to 15 percent boulders.

The A horizon is 10YR 7/2, 6/3 or 5/2.  Moist color is 10YR 5/2,,
4/3 or 3/2.  Layers with colors of 10YR 5/2 dry and 10YR 3/2 moist are less than 7 inches thick.  Gravel content ranges from 20 to 50 percent.

The C1 horizon is 10YR 7/4, 7/3 or 6/4.  Moist color is 10YR 5/4,
4/4 or 4/3.  Gravel content ranges from 50 to 60 percent.

The C2 horizon is 10YR 8/3, 7/6 or 2.5Y 6/2.  Moist color is 10YR 6/4, 5/6 or 2.5Y 4/2.  Gravel content ranges from 40 to 65
percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Grove, Neilton, Netrac,
Snoqualmie and Wiseman soils.  All of these soils lack bedrock
within 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Janile soils are on mountain sideslopes.
Slopes range from 30 to 75 percent.  These soils formed in
material weathered from granite.  Elevation is 4,300 to 5,800
feet.  The climate is semi-arid with warm dry summers and cold
moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 25 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F., mean July temperature is about 65 degrees F. and mean January temperature is about 30 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bonta, Chimney, Mottsville and Waterman soils.  Bonta soils have a sandy loam argillic horizon.  Chimney and Mottsville soils are deep and
sandy.  Waterman soils are shallow.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; runoff
is rapid; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used as rangeland or for timber production.
The vegetation is Jeffery pine, black oak, bitterbrush and squawcarpet.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern California, western Lassen County.  The soils of this series are not extensive.
