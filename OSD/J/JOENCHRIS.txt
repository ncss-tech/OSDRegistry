Carryback, Golars, and Zumwalt soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Crowcamp soils have mollic epipedons that are 50 to 75 cm thick, endosaturation within 100 cm of the soil surface, and a firm, brittle, silica-enriched horizon within 40 inches of the soil surface.  Hankins soils are deep to paralithic contacts and have mollic epipedons that are 50 to 100 cm thick.  Jesh soils have less than 30 percent rock fragments in the 2Btk horizons.  Lacrol soils have episaturation within 50 cm of the soil surface between March and May and have less than 30 percent rock fragments in the 2Btk horizons.  Longbarn soils are deep to lithic contacts.  Tippett soils have albic horizons and less than 30 percent rock fragments in the 2Btk horizons.  Warpaint soils have an aridic moisture regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Joenchris soils are on fan remnants.  They typically occur on summit positions.  They formed in eolian volcanic ash over alluvium derived from volcanic and metavolcanic rocks.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,895 to 2,380 meters.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 360 to 410 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Nohelp and Ocashe soils.  Nohelp soils are clayey-skeletal and have thick mollic epipedons.  Ocashe soils are ashy-skeletal, very shallow and shallow to lithic contacts, and have a mesic temperature regime.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high surface runoff; slow permeability, moderately low or moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Joenchris soils are used for rangeland, recreation, watershed, and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is mainly low sagebrush and Thurber's needlegrass with some scattered singleleaf pinyon.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern California, along the boundary between the Sierra Nevada Range and the western Great Basin.  These soils are not extensive with about 730 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 26.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 36 cm (A, AE, and 2Bt horizons).
Palexerolls great group feature - The abrupt clay increase of more than 20 percent at 15 cm (between the AE and 2Bt horizons).
Argillic horizon - The zone from 15 to 152 cm (2Bt, 2Btss, and 2Btk horizons).
Slickensides and cracks - The zone from 36 to 66 cm (2Btss horizon).
Identifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 66 to 152 cm (2Btk horizon).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 15 to 65 cm (2Bt and part of the 2Btss horizons).

The revision of December 2004 updated the series concept based on volcanic glass count data for adjacent soils.  Volcanic glass and oxalate aluminum and iron contents are estimated.
