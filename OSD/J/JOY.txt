JOY SERIES

The Joy series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on uplands and high terraces. These soils formed in loess.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquic Hapludolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Joy silt loam, on a nearly level slope in a cultivated field at an elevation of 197 meters (645 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated).

[Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 61 to 122 cm (24 to 48 inches).]

	Cg--124 to 150 cm (49 to 60 inches); light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silt loam; massive; friable; many medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; common black (7.5YR 2.5/1) iron-manganese oxides along cleavage planes; slightly alkaline. 

TYPE LOCATION: Henry County, Illinois; about 4 miles northeast of Geneseo; 1,980 feet east and 2,600 feet north of the southwest corner of sec. 26, T. 18 N., R. 3 E.; USGS Spring Hill topographic quadrangle; lat. 41 degrees 31 minutes 10 seconds N. and long. 90 degrees 07 minutes 00 seconds W., NAD 27.

A or Ap horizon:
Hue: 10YR

Some pedons have a Bg horizon, and some have transitional BC horizons. 

Cg or C horizon:

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Amana, Breeds, Grantcenter, Joyce, Kingston, Klinger, Klingmore, Lakefield, Larpenteur, McCreath, Muscatine, Nerwoods, Okabena, Primghar, and Ransom series. Amana soils formed in alluvium and sand content is variable below depths of 102 cm (40 inches). Grantcenter soils formed in alluvium and have 15 to 50 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Breeds soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Joyce soils average more than 10 percent sand coarser than very fine in the lower part of the series control section. Kingston, Lakefield, Larpenteur, Okabena, and Ransom soils have carbonates within 102 cm (40 inches). Klinger, Klingmore, McCreath, Muscatine, and Primghar soils average more than 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Joy soils are on upland ridges and high terraces. Slope gradients typically are less than 2 percent and range from 0 to 5 percent. Joy soils formed entirely in loess. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.2 to 11.1 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 965 mm (30 to 38 inches). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Port Byron soils, and the Mt. Carroll and Sable soils. Port Byron and Mt. Carroll soils are well drained and on higher and more sloping positions. Sable soils are poorly drained, are on lower positions, and contain 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained.  Low or medium runoff.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderate. These soils have an apparent seasonal high water table at a depth of 31 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) in the spring. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most Joy soils are cultivated. Corn, soybeans, and small grain are the principal crops. Some areas are used for pasture. Native vegetation is prairie grasses. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Illinois, but also in Wisconsin, Missouri, and Minnesota; LRR K and M, MLRAs 95B, 104, 105, 107B, 108B, and 115C. The series is of large extent (more than 100,000 acres correlated).

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Henderson County, Illinois, 1947. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
mollic epipedon: from a depth of 0 to 43 cm (0 to 17 inches) (Ap, A1, and A2 horizons)
cambic horizon: from a depth of 43 to 124 cm (17 to 49 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and Btg horizons);

Particle-size control section: from a depth of 25 to 102 cm (10 to 40 inches) (A1, A2, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and Btg horizons);
Series control section: from a depth of 0 to 152 cm (0 to 60 inches) (Ap, A1, A2, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Btg, and Cg horizons);

Most cambic horizons in these soils have few or common, faint clay films on the faces of peds. The increase in clay content is not enough to meet criteria for an argillic horizon. Data for this pedon (78IL-073-094) indicates the greatest increase in clay is 14 percent. 

These soils formed in loess near a major loess source. Very fine sandy loam and loam textures are allowed in the substratum because the loess here is relatively coarse and may contain a high content of very fine sand. 

A sandy substratum phase with loamy sand or sand textures was previously recognized. These soils are now within the concept of the Joyce series.
