JAMASH SERIES


The Jamash series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from Permian shale. Jamash soils are on pediments in River Valleys in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 74 centimeters (29 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 15 degrees C. (59 degrees F.).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, active, thermic, shallow Udorthentic Haplustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Jamash clay loam on a west facing, 1 percent slope in cropland at an elevation of 1490 feet (454 meters). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) When described on 10/30/96 the soil was moist from 0 to 15 inches (0 to 38 centimeters).

  Ap--0 to 10 centimeters (0 to 4 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/3), interior, clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3), interior, moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots throughout; 32.0 percent clay; noneffervescent throughout (HCl, 1 normal); slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary (10 to 20 centimeters (4 to 8 inches) thick)

  Bw--10 to 28 centimeters (4 to 11 inches); reddish brown (5YR 4/3), interior, clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3), interior, moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak medium angular blocky; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine roots throughout; 37.0 percent clay; common distinct continuous reddish brown (5YR 4/3), moist, clay films on vertical and horizontal faces of peds and few distinct discontinuous dark brown (7.5YR 3/2), moist, organic coats on faces of peds and in pores; very slightly effervescent throughout (HCl, 1 normal); 2 percent well rounded shale channers; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary. (13 to 30 centimeters (5 to 12 inches) thick)

  BC--28 to 38 centimeters (11 to 15 inches); reddish brown (5YR 5/4), interior, silty clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4), interior, moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; 30 percent platy rock structure; extremely hard, extremely firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots throughout; 30.0 percent clay; slightly effervescent throughout (HCl, 1 normal); moderately alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 20 centimeters (0 to 8 inches) thick)

  Cr1--38 to 71 centimeters (15 to 28 inches); reddish brown (2.5YR 5/3) weathered shale, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/3) moist; noneffervescent throughout (HCl, 1 normal); clear smooth boundary. 

  Cr2--71 to 203 centimeters (28 to 80 inches); 50 percent reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) and 50 percent light greenish gray (5GY 7/1) weathered shale, 50 percent dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) and 50 percent greenish gray (5GY 6/1) moist; noneffervescent throughout (HCl, 1 normal)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Masham, Piedmont, Poxmash, Renthin and Zellmont series. 
All of these soils occur on the same landscapes. 
Masham soils do not have a mollic epipedon. 
Piedmont and Zellmont soils are moderately deep. 
Renthin and Poxmash soils are deep.
