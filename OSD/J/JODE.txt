JODE SERIES

The Jode series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Jode soils are on flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Cumulic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jode loam, on a 2 percent slope, in a hay field, at an elevation of 8,100 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) Described on April 21, 1989.

    A1--0 to 7 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary.

    Bk1--7 to 17 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak very fine subangular blocky; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine pores; strongly effervescent; few fine carbonate masses; 1 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 5 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary.

    Bk2--17 to 26 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine pores; strongly effervescent; few fine carbonate masses; 6 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 5 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the A horizons: 20 to 30 inches thick)

    Bk3--26 to 45 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; hard, weak course subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine pores; strongly effervescent; common fine calcium carbonate masses; 6 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 5 percent rock fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary.

    Bk4--45 to 60 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; massive; hard, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine pores; strongly effervescent; common fine calcium carbonate masses; 8 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 10 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).  (combined thickness of the Bk horizons: 30 to 40 inches)

TYPE LOCATION:  Park County, Colorado; about 11 miles southeast of Guffey, about 1100 feet south and 1200 feet east of the northwest corner of sec. 32, T. 15 S., R. 71 W.; High Park USGS quad; 4284320m N., 468180m E., Zone 13; lat. 38 degrees 42 minutes 25 seconds N. and long. 105 degrees 21 minutes 58 seconds W., NAD 1983.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Breezebasin, Brycan, Cordeston, Dalmatian, Enbar, Jodero, Mcgaffey, Nutrioso, Pinridge, Polich, Staad, and Straw series.
Breezebasin, Cordeston, Dalmatian, Enbar, Jodero, Nutrioso, and Staad soils do not have secondary carbonate accumulations.
Brycan, Polich, and Straw soils have lithologic discontinuities.
Mcgaffey and Pinridge soils are dry in some part of the moisture control section in July and August in normal years.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  alluvium mainly from volcanics and granitic rocks
Landform:  flood plains
Slopes:  0 to 6 percent
Elevation:  6600 to 8600 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  42 to 44 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  14 to 16 inches
Precipitation pattern:  Monthly precipitation is lowest in winter and greatest in July and August.
Frost-free period:  80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Cathedral series.  The Cathedral soils are shallow and are on mountains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  well drained, moderate permeability

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for hayland and rangeland.  Potential native vegetation is mainly western wheatgrass, Arizona fescue, blue grama, Parry's oatgrass, mountain muhly, green needlegrass, big bluestem, and nodding brome.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Park County, Colorado, Teller-Park soil survey area, 2010. The name is coined.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section: The zone from 0 to 60 inches.
Particle-size control section: The zone from 10 to 40 inches (Bk1, Bk2, and Bk3 horizons)
Mollic epipedon (Cumulic feature): from 0 to 60 inches. (entire profile)
Secondary calcium carbonate accumulation: from 7 to 60 inches (Bk1, Bk2, Bk3, Bk4 horizons)
Irregular decrease in organic carbon (Cumulic feature): throughout the pedon, inferred from the variation in color and the landscape position.
