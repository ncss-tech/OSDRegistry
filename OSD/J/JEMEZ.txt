JEMEZ SERIES

The Jemez series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from tuff and latite on hills and on interfluves on plateaus.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jemez loam-- forested.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 6 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)

    E--6 to 13 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common medium roots; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 8 inches thick)

    BE--13 to 19 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common medium roots; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt--19 to 27 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/4) sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common thin discontinuous clay films on faces of peds; few fine and medium roots; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (6 to 16 inches thick)

    2R--27 inches; tuff.

TYPE LOCATION:  Baca Location No. 1, Sandoval County, New Mexico; 1.1 miles NE along road from SW corner of El Cajete.  New Mexico state plane coordinates N.  1,761,500 feet and E. 394,000 feet.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture regime: typic ustic
Depth to lithic contact:  20 to 40 inches
Rock fragment content (weighted average):  0 to 15 percent mainly fragments of tuff
Volcanic glass content: 5 to 15 percent in the coarse silt plus sand fraction (estimated)

A horizon
Hue:  10YR or 7.5YR
Value:  2 to 5 dry, 2 to 4 moist
Chroma: 1 to 4
Reaction:  neutral or slightly alkaline

E horizon (a lower A horizon in some pedons)
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR
Value:  4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4
Reaction: slightly alkaline or neutral

Bt horizon
Hue:  5YR to 10YR
Value:  4 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma:  2 to 6
Texture: clay loam, sandy clay loam, or loam
Clay content: 20 to 35 percent

10YR colors occur in the upper part of the Bt horizon or as coatings on faces of peds.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alderon, Allens Park, Bayerton, Belltower, Elbeth, Elbuck, Elmark, Haugan, Hoyt, Jemco, Kunz, Littlepine, Losindios, Lumpgulch, Northrim, Plome, Rule, Shoemaker, Sweetweed, and Tunitcha series.

Alderon, Bayerton, Belltower, Lumpgulch: have moisture patterns that have spring dominated (May and June) precipitation

Allens Park: have rock fragments of granite

Alderon, Belltower, Elmark, Lumpgulch: moderately deep to a paralithic contact

Elbeth, Elbuck, Haugan, Hoyt, Kunz, Littlepine, Losindios, Northrim, Plome, Rule, Sweetweed, Tunitcha: do not have a lithic or paralithic contact within 40 inches of the surface

Jemco: have silt loam surface horizons and have rock fragments of sandstone

Shoemaker: have redox features and rock fragments of sandstone and shale

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jemez series are on hills and on interfluves on plateaus and have slopes of 1 to 15 percent.  They formed in slope alluvium from tuff and latite.  Elevations are 7,500 to 8,800 feet.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 to 24 inches. The mean annual temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F., and the frost-free period is about 60 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cajete and Totavi series.  Cajete soils formed in pumice and are skeletal.  Totavi soils are deep, lack a argillic horizon, and have a deep, dark colored surface layer.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; low to medium runoff; moderate or moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Jemez soils are used mainly for timber production. The natural vegetation is ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, and white fir, with an understory of mountain muhly, Arizona fescue, and pine dropseed.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northcentral New Mexico.  Series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Sandoval County, New Mexico; 1981.

REMARKS: In October 2000, taxonomic classification was converted to the closest match found in Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition 1999.  Previous classification was fine-loamy, mixed Mollic Eutroboralfs. Some update was made to horizon nomenclature, competing series section, etc.  Other placements may be more appropriate after a complete update.

Responsibility transferred to the Lakewood MO 5/2001.

This pedon may have sufficient volcanic glass for the Vitrandic subgroup; future investigation will need to determine this. At this time it is presumed to have a significant component of volcanic glass, so an estimate was added to the Range in Characteristics. This may help to provide separation from competitors until this question is resolved.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 13 inches.  (A and E horizons)
Argillic horizons:  The zone from 19 to 27 inches.  (Bt horizons)
Lithic contact:  Tuff at 27 inches. (2R layer)
Particle-size control section - from 19 to 27 inches.
