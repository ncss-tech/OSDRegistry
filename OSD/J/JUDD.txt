JUDD SERIES

The Judd series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in material derived from the Gila conglomerate. Judd soils are on old dissected alluvial fans and piedmonts and have slopes of 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Judd loam, rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 2 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common fine tubular pores; noncalcareous; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick)

    Bt1--2 to 8 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; few thin clay films on faces of peds and in pores; noncalcareous; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt2--8 to 18 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) clay, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; strong medium blocky structure; very hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; many moderately thick clay films on faces of peds and in pores; noncalcareous; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); gradual smooth boundary. (8 to 15 inches thick)

    Ck--18 to 60 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine interstitial pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5).

TYPE LOCATION:  Grant County, New Mexico; about one mile south of Mule Creek; about 400 feet north and 200 feet west of the SE corner of the SW1/4 of sec. 6, T. 14 S. R. 20 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  

Depth to the calcic horizon: 13 to 25 inches.

Soil moisture: Aridic ustic moisture regime.

Mean annual soil temperature: 49 to 59 degrees F.

A horizon
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 1 through 3 dry, and 1 or 2 moist

B horizon
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 3 through 5 dry and moist
Chroma: 1 through 4 dry and moist
Texture: clay loam or clay
Clay content: averages more than 35 percent clay.

Ck horizon
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 5 through 7 dry and moist
Chroma: 2 or 4 dry and moist
Texture: loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam
Calcium carbonate: more than 15 percent
Rock fragments: up to 35 percent gravel, and in some pedons is weakly cemented Gila conglomerate.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cantina (NM), Carnero (NM), Celsosprings (NM), Charette (NM), Concho (NM), Cueva (NM), Remunda (NM) and Philmont (NM) series. Carnero soils have free carbonates of lime-coated pebbles in the Bt horizon. Cueva soils have a paralithic contact between 20 to 40 inch depths. Abrazo, Carnero and Cueva soils have bedrock between 20 and 40 inches. Celsospring soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the Bt. Charette soils are noncalcareous to a depth of 51 inches. Concho soils have calcic horizons. Remunda and Philmontsoils have less than 30 percent sand in the Bt horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Judd soils are at elevations of 5,000 to 6,000 feet on dissected fans and piedmonts and have slopes of 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 57 degrees F. The average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches and occurs mainly as thunderstorms in July, August, and September. The frost-free season is 150 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Lonti, Manzano, and Ruidoso soils. These soils lack a calcic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for rangeland. Present native vegetation is black grama, sideoats grama, threeawn, hairy grama, and snakeweed.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern New Mexico. The series is of small extent. MLRA 38.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Grant County, New Mexico, Central and Southern Parts, 1979.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - The zone from 0 to 18 inches (A & Bt horizons)

Argillic horizon - The zone from 2 to 18 inches (Bt horizons)

Calcic horizon - The zone from 18 to 60 inches (Ck horizon)

Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Tenth Edition, 2006

Classification changed from Typic subgroup to Aridic subgroup in 2006. This change was made to be consistent with the soil moisture regime.
