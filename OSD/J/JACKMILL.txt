JACKMILL SERIES

The Jackmill series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and slope alluvium from rhyolite, quartzite and sandstone with loess influence.  Jackmill soils are on fan remnants and have slopes of 2 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 1.4 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Basinpeak, Berrycreek, Decram, Fairydell, Foxmount, Gaia, Klug, Krackle, Lag, Middlehill, Rockabin, Steepshrub, Sup, Timmercrek, and Wareagle series.  The Basinpeak soils have 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Berrycreek, Lag, Sheepshrub, Timmercrek,and Wareagle soils have an O horizon.  Decram, Foxmount, Krackle, Middlehill, and Rockabin soils are moderately deep.  Fairydell soils have 20 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are slighty to strongly effervescent in the lower part of the subsoil and substratum.  Gaia and Sup soils lack a cambic horizon and the silica accumulation.  Klug soils lack the silica accumulation and the coarse textured (coarse sand or loamy sand) in the lower part of the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ediebench, Latigo, Poso Windicreek, and Zeebar soil.  Ediebench soils are very deep, fine, smectitc soils and are on mountains, fan remnants, and hillslopes.  Latigo soils are loamy-skeletal and formed in calcareous loess and slope alluvium from material weathered from rhyolite and are on hillslopes,  fan remnants and structural benches.  Poso soils are loamy-skeletal and formed in residuum and slope alluvium derived dominantly from calcareous sandstone conglomerate and are on nearly level to extremely steep fan remnant ridges.   Windicreek soils are loamy-skeletal and are on nearly level to very steep fan remnants derived dominantly from calcareous sandstone conglomerate.  Zeebar soils are loamy-skeletal and are formed in colluvium from quartzite, basalt and tuff and are on mountains, hillslopes, ridges and fan remnants.
