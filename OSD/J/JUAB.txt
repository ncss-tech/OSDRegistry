JUAB SERIES

The Juab series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in lacustrine deposits and alluvium from sedimentary, quartzite and igneous rock.  Juab soils are on alluvial fans, alluvial plains and lake plains and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Torrifluventic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Juab loam--nonirrigated cropland.  (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap1--0 to 4 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium platy structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; common fine pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 4 inches thick)

    Ap2--4 to 8 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots; few medium pores; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 5 inches thick)

    AC--8 to 13 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots; common fine pores; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); gradual smooth boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    C1--13 to 21 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; few fine and medium pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); gradual smooth boundary.  (6 to 8 inches thick)

    C2--21 to 29 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); gradual smooth boundary.  (6 to 8 inches thick)

    C3--29 to 38 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few fine and very fine pores; about 3 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); gradual smooth boundary.  (7 to 10 inches thick)

    C4--38 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine discontinuous pores; strongly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2)

TYPE LOCATION:  Utah County, Utah; about 30 feet west of Manning Canyon Road, about 1 mile from White's Ranch; 2,500 feet west and 100 feet south of northeast corner of sec. 19, T. 6. S., R. 2 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Soil moisture: Dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 50 to 60 percent of the time that the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F., at a depth of 20 inches. Aridic bordering xeric soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 47 to 54 degrees F. 

Thickness of the mollic epipedon: 10 to 19 inches

Particle-size control section (weighted average):
  Texture: dominantly loam or silt loam, and has thin strata of fine sandy loam or gravelly loam with 15 to 35 percent fine sand or coarser.
   Clay content: 18 to 27 percent clay

A horizon:
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry and moist
Reaction: Slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline 
Effervescence: Slightly effervescent to strongly effervescent

C horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR
Value: 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4, dry and moist
Texture: Loam, silt loam or light silty clay loam, with thin strata of fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or gravelly loam
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent gravel
Reaction: Slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline 
Effervescence: Strongly effervescent to violently effervescent

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Etta (UT), Fanu (NV), Harpt (ID) and Kazul (NV) series.  
Etta soils are noncalcareous and have more than 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  
Fanu soils have over 20 percent volcanic ash or other pyroclastic materials in the silt or coarser fraction.
Harpt soils are noncalcareous and are slightly acid or neutral.
Kazul soils have very gravelly textures in the C horizons. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Juab soils are at elevations of 4,600 to 6,000 feet.  They occur on level to sloping alluvial fans, alluvial plains and lake plains.  These soils formed in alluvium from quartzite, sandstone, limestone, shale and basic igneous rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  The freeze-free period is 100 to l40 days.  Average annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Alovar, Borvant, Donnardo, Doyce, Genola, Kirkham, Logy, Moroni, Mountainville, and Wales soils and the competing Musinia soils.  Alovar, Genola, Moroni and Wales soils have an ochric epipedon.  Borvant soils have a petrocalcic horizon.  Donnardo, Loggy and Mountainville soils are loamy-skeletal.  Doyce soils have an argillic horizon.  Kirkham soils are fine-silty and moderately well or somewhat poorly drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for irrigated and nonirrigated cropland and rangeland.  The principal crops are alfalfa hay, small grains and corn for silage.  The principal crop on nonirrigated cropland is wheat.  Potential vegetation is big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Utah.  This series is moderately extensive. MLRA 28A.
