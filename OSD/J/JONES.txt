JONES SERIES

The Jones series consists of deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in loamy marine sediments. These soils are on uplands and sideslopes of the Coastal Plain.  Slopes range from 5 to 30 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, siliceous, active, thermic Ultic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jones sandy loam--pasture.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

     Ap--0 to 8 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) sandy loam; weak fine granular structure; very friable, common fine roots; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 10 inches thick)

     A2--8 to 12 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) loamy sand; single grained; very friable; common fine roots; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 9 inches thick)

     B1--12 to 17 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) sandy loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; few fine roots; common sand grains coated and bridged with clay; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (4 to 13 inches thick)

     B2t--17 to 43 inches; red (2.5YR 4/6) sandy loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; few fine roots; most sand grains coated and bridged with clay; slightly acid; diffuse smooth boundary.  (14 to 30 inches thick)

     B3--43 to 52 inches; dark red (2.5YR 3/6) sandy loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; medium acid; diffuse smooth boundary.  (0 to 14 inches thick)

     C--52 to 73 inches; red (10YR 5/8) loamy sand; single grained; loose; few fine mica flakes; medium acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Autauga County, Alabama; 3/4 mile northeast of White Water Lake in the SW1/4NE1/4NW1/4SE1/4, sec. 9, T. 18 N., R.  14 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to about 70 inches.  Reaction of the A horizon is slightly acid or medium acid and that of the B horizon is strongly acid through slightly acid.

The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy sand.

The B1 horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 8.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.

The B2t and B3 horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5YR, or 5YR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 6 or 8.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.

The C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5YR, or 5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 6 or 8.  Texture is loamy sand or sandy loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other known series in this family.  Competing series in related families are the Bienville, Macon, and Sekil series.  Bienville soils lack continuous B2t horizons.
Macon soils have B2t horizons with more than 18 percent clay. Sekil soils have mixed mineralogy.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jones soils are on moderate to steep sloping uplands of the Coastal Plains.  The soil formed in thick beds of unconsolidated sandy loams or loamy sands.  Slopes range from 5 to 30 percent.  The climate is humid.  Near the type location the mean annual temperature is about 67 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 54 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  In addition to the competing Macon series, these are the Lucy, Luverne, Pine Flat, and Troup series.  All these soils have base saturation of less than 35
percent 50 inches below the top of argillic horizon.  Lucy and Troup soils have sandy A horizons over 20 inches thick.  Luverne soils have control sections with more than 35 percent clay.  Pine Flat soils have thicker argillic horizons and have upper B horizons of dark red color.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderately rapid permeability; slow through rapid runoff.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Much of the soil is in mixed pine-oak forest.  Many of the less sloping areas have been cleared and are being used for pastureland.  Native vegetation consists of upland oak, longleaf, and loblolly pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Coastal Plains of Alabama and possibly Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas.  This series is of moderate extent.
