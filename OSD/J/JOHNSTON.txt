RANGE OF INDIVIDUAL HORIZONS: 

Oa horizon (where present):
Color--hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 1 or 2, hue of 2.5Y, value of 2.5 or 3, chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 2.5 or 3
Texture--muck 

A horizon:
Color--hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 1 or 2, hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 2.5 or 3, chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 2.5 or 3
Texture (fine-earth fraction)--coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam and may include the mucky texture modifier.
Redoximorphic features (where present)--masses of oxidized iron in shades of red, yellow, or brown and iron depletions in shades of gray
Other features--Organic matter content of the A horizon ranges from 3 to about 20 percent 

Cg horizon:
Color--hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 8, chroma of 1 to 2, or is neutral with value of 4 to 7
