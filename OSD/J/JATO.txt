JATO SERIES

The Jato series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in gypsiferous lacustrine deposits. These nearly level soils are on relict lakebeds and level interdunes on basin floors. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Loki series.  The Loki soils have a depth to gypsic horizon of less than 20 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Jato soils are on relict lakebeds and level interdunes on basin floors.  These soils formed in gypsiferous lacustrine deposits.  Slope is 0 to 3 percent.  Elevation is 3,900 to 4,020 feet.  The mean annual air temperature is 64 to 70 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.  Precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September. The driest months are March and April. Precipitation during the months of January, February, and March is less than 13 percent of the total.  The frost-free period is 180 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Basso, Copia, Elizario, Hermes, Loki, Mcnew, Peligro, and Talos soils.  Basso soils have argillic horizons.  Copia soils are sandy and are on coppice dunes.  Elizario and Mcnew soils are on slightly depressed and slightly higher positions respectively of the alluvial flat of the basin floor.  Hermes soils formed in gypsiferous lacustrine sediments.  Loki soils have gypsic mineralogy.  Peligro soils formed in eolian gypsiferous sediments on lunettes or parna dunes.  Talos soils are fine textured.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderate. Runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for military exercises and weapons testing. Vegetation is of the desert shrub type and consists of 4-Wing saltbush, mesquite, gordons bladderpod, bush muhly, tobosa, western tansymustard, burrograss, plains bristlegrass, sixweeks fescue, Torreys jointfir, pepperweed, and gyp scorpion weed.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Trans-Pecos of Texas and southern New Mexico; LRR D, MLRA 42; small extent.
