JUEL SERIES

The Juel series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum weathered from sandstone and shale. These soils are on hillslopes and pediments.  Slopes are 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Ustic Haplargids 

TYPICAL PEDON: Juel loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 10 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4), moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable, soft, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; many fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline, pH 8.2; clear smooth boundary. (3 to 11 cm thick)

    Btk--10 to 25 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) clay loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4), moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; common fine roots; many fine tubular pores; 10 percent faint clay films on all faces of peds; 10 percent parachanners; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 50 cm thick)

    Bkz--25 to 110 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely parachannery loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), moist; massive; firm, moderately hard, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few fine roots throughout; many fine tubular pores; 50 percent carbonate coats on bottom surfaces of rock fragments; salts are finely disseminated; 65 percent parachanners; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline, pH 7.8; clear wavy boundary. (50 to 100 cm thick)

    Cr--110 to 200 cm; shale bedrock.
