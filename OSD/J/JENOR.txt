JENOR SERIES

The Jenor series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources with a component of loess.  Jenor soils are on calderas and fan piedmont remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haplodurids

TYPE LOCATION:  Lander County, Nevada; approximately 12 miles north of Battle Mountain, about 1,050 feet north and 1,050 feet east of the southwest corner of section 17, T. 34 N., R. 45 E.; USGS Russells 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 49 minutes 04 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 56 minutes 14 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.8177778 latitude, -116.9372222 longitude.

Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  8 to 18 percent.
Rock fragments:  Up to 25 percent, mainly gravel.

A horizon
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Consistence:  Soft or slightly hard dry, friable or very friable moist.

Bw horizon
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Jolan series.  Jolan soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 11 to 14 degrees C. and are moist in some part of the soil moisture control section for short periods during the summer months.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jenor soils are on calderas and fan piedmont remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources with a component of loess.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 1,160 to 1,710 meters. The climate is cool, arid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 130 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 95 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Beoska, Blacka, Broyles and Chiara soils.  Beoska soils lack an indurated duripan and have a fine loamy Bt horizon.  Blacka soils have a strongly cemented duripan.  Broyles soils are very deep and lack an indurated duripan.  Chiara soils are less than 50 cm to the indurated duripan.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow or medium runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly shadscale, bud sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Nevada and Southwest Idaho.  These soils are not extensive. MLRA 24 and 25.
