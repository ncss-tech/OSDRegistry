JEFFLAKE SERIES

The Jefflake series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in glacial till which overlies soft sediments of Quaternary and Tertiary Age.  These soils are on nearly level to moderately steep mountain slopes, ridges, plateaus, and basins.  Slopes are both simple or complex and are 0 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 890 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic Aquic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jefflake very gravelly sandy clay loam-timber.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated)

     Oi--0 to 3 cm; partially decomposed litter of conifer needles and twigs.

     E--3 to 26 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly sandy clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common fine and medium roots and few coarse roots; common fine and medium interstitial pores and few medium tubular pores; 40 percent pebbles and 5 percent cobbles; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); clear wavy boundary.  (15 to 28 cm thick)

     Bt1--26 to 56 cm; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) very gravelly heavy clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; few fine distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) mottles, moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots and few coarse roots; common fine and medium interstitial pores and few medium tubular pores; common thin clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 35 percent pebbles and 5 percent cobbles; strongly acid (pH 5.4); clear smooth boundary.

     Bt2--56 to 112 cm; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) very gravelly clay, strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) moist; few fine distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) mottles; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and plastic; few fine and medium roots; few fine interstitial pores; many thin clay films on faces of peds, common moderately thick clay films lining pores; 30 percent pebbles and 10 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons - 50 to more than 150 cm)

     BCg--112 to 155 cm; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) very gravelly clay loam, brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) moist; few fine distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) and black (10YR 2/1) mottles; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and plastic; few fine roots; few fine interstitial pores; few thin clay films on faces of peds; 30 percent pebbles and 15 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  Albany County, Wyoming; NE1/4, SW1/4 of sec. 10, T. 16 N., R. 78 W.
