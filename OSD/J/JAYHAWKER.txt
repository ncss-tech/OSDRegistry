JAYHAWKER SERIES

The Jayhawker series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils.  These nearly level to slightly depressional soils formed in loamy fluviomarine dpoesits of the Lissie Formation of early to mid-Pleistocene age. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 19.5 degrees C (67 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1295 mm (51 in

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Hardin County, Texas; 1998.

REMARKS:  The Jayhawker soils were previously included with the Sorter and Waller series.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 in) (A horizon)

Albic horizon: 15 to 91 cm (6 to 36 in) (Eg and Eg/Btg horizons)

Glossic horizon: 51 to 203 cm (20 to 80 in) (Eg/Btg, Btg/Eg, and Exg/Btxg horizons.  The glossic horizon is series criteria but not diagostic for classification.)

Fragipan: 175 to 203 cm (69 to 80 in) (Exg/Btxg horizon.  The fragipan is series criteria but not diagnostic for classification)

Argillic horizon: 91 to 175 (36 to 69 in) (Btg/Eg horizon)

Aquic feature--This soil is saturated to the surface from late November to the end of May, has aquic conditions in most years, and has redoximorphic features with chroma of 2 or less.
