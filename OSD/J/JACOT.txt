JACOT SERIES

The Jacot series consists of very deep, well drained soils on hillslopes, mountain slopes and ridges. They formed in colluvium weathered from gneiss or granitic bedrock with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. Slopes are 3 to 80 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 965 mm and the average annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Blackprince, Hugus, and Keeler soils, and the Garveson and Kruse soils. Blackprince soils are on south-facing convex slopes and are xeric and loamy-skeletal. Garveson soils are on convex foothill slopes and are medial over sandy or sandy-skeletal. Hugus soils are on north-facing foothills and dissected terraces and are loamy-skeletal. Keeler and Kruse soils are fine-loamy and are on south, east, and west-facing foothill slopes. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity in the upper part and high to very high in the lower part. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing, recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Potential natural vegetation is mainly western hemlock, western redcedar, western white pine, grand fir, Douglas-fir, western larch, and lodgepole pine, with an understory of queencup beadlily, American trailplant, Columbia brome, violet, starry false-Solomon's-seal, sweetscented bedstraw, goldthread, longtube twinflower, Oregon fairybells, oneleaf foamflower, piper anemone, and western rattlesnake plantain. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Idaho and eastern Washington. This soil is moderately extensive. MLRA 43A.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon - zone from 0 to 15 cm (Oi, Oe, A horizons). 
Cambic horizon - zone from 15 to 40 cm (Bw horizon). 
Argillic horizon - zone from 40 to 107 cm (2Bt1, 2Bt2 horizons). 
Volcanic ash mantle - zone from 5 to 40 cm (A, Bw horizons). 
Particle size control section - zone from 5 to 105 cm (A, Bw, 2Bt1, part of 2Bt2 horizons). 

Additional information: Jacot soils should be further investigated to determine typical mineralogy (isotic vs. mixed), if mixed then the cation-exchange activity class will need to be evaluated.
