JAYBEE SERIES

The Jaybee series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Jaybee soils are on hills, mountains, and plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Lithic Xeric Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jaybee very cobbly sandy loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered with 25 percent gravel and 25 percent cobbles.

    A1--0 to 10 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very cobbly sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular and common very fine vesicular pores; 15 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 13 cm thick)

    A2--10 to 20 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular and common very fine interstitial pores; 25 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 13 cm thick)

    Bt--20 to 36 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak fine subangular blocky; hard; very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine, common medium and coarse roots; common very fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 20 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt irregular boundary.  (8 to 25 cm thick)

    R--36 cm; fractured, unweathered basalt.

TYPE LOCATION:  Washoe County, Nevada; west of the Smoke Creek Desert and about 2 miles northeast of Burro Mountain; approximately 1,400 feet south and 260 feet east of the northwest corner of section 16, T. 31 N., R. 19 E.; USGS Salt Marsh 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 33 minutes 54.7 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 51 minutes 38.6 seconds W; NAD 83 minutes 54.7 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 51 minutes 38.6 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.5651944latitude, -119.8607222 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually moist during winter and spring, dry during summer and fall; aridic soil moisture regime that borders on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 14 degrees C.
Depth to bedrock: 18 to 36 cm to a lithic contact.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 25 to 35 percent.
Rock fragments: Averages 15 to 35 percent, mainly gravel.  Lithology of fragments is volcanic rocks such as basalt.

A horizons
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR.
Value: 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist; The upper 18 cm after mixing has value of 6 dry or 4 moist.
Chroma: 2 through 4, dry or moist.
Reaction: Neutral or slightly alkaline.

Bt horizon
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR.
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4, dry or moist.
Texture: Gravelly clay or gravelly clay loam.
Clay content: 35 to 45 percent.
Rock fragments: 15 to 35 percent.
Reaction: Neutral or slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Banbury, Bombadil, Dougal, Fubble, Kreza, Meninik, and Stumount series.  These soils all have less than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jaybee soils are on hills, mountains, and plateaus.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basalt or similar volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,300 to 2,000 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 9 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Pickup and Wylo soils.  Pickup soils are clayey-skeletal, moderately deep to lithic contacts, and have Mollic epipedons.  Wylo soils are clayey and have Mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high or very high surface runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Jaybee soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Lahontan sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, cheatgrass, and Thurber's needlegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Nevada and northeastern California.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 23.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Washoe County, Nevada (Central Part), 1990.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 20 cm (A1 and A2 horizons).
Argillic horizon - The zone from 20 to 36 cm (Bt horizon).
Lithic contact - The boundary at 36 cm to underlying hard bedrock (R layer).
Particle-size control section - The zone from the soil surface to 36 cm (A1, A2, and Bt horizons).
