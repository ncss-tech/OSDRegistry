JEHEMY SERIES

The Jehemy series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in alluvium material derived mostly from sedimentary rock sources.  Jehemy soils are on marine terraces and hills and have slopes of 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 millimeters (11 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, isothermic Sodic Haplusterts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jehemy clay-on a north facing slope of 4 percent under a cover of slender oats, Mediterranean barley, soft chess and Australian saltbush at 220 meters (730 feet) elevation.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.  When described on October 21, l984, the soil was slightly moist to 51 centimeters (20 inches) and moist below.)

TYPE LOCATION:  San Nicolas Island, California, going southwest from the Fire station #4 about 1.0 kilometer (0.6 miles) and then about 90 meters (300 feet) going southeast from the paved road past two gullies to site, about 90 meters (300 feet) southeast from the tall metal frame antenna tower; 33.2399056 degrees latitude, -119.4902556 degrees longitude; UTM Zone 11, 3680648.46n, 267972.92e; U.S.G.S. Quad Name: San Nicolas Island.


RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to bedrock is greater than 150 centimeters.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 17 degrees C (62.6 degrees F.), and the difference between the mean summer and the mean winter is about 5 degrees C (9 degrees F).  The soil between the depths of 15 and 26 centimeters (6 and 14 inches) is dry in all parts from about May or June to November and is moist in all parts of the soil moisture control section from January to mid-March 60 to 75 days.  The soil temperature is always above 8 degrees C (47 degrees F).  The moisture regime is ustic bordering on aridic.  When dry, the soil develops cracks that are at least 1 cm wide and 15 to 36 centimeters (6 to 12 inches) apart at a depth of 71 centimeters (28 inches).  The cracks remain open from sometime in June or July until sometime in October.  The soil is neutral or moderately alkaline. Some pedons have finely disseminated calcium carbonate or calcium carbonate is segregated as few fine seams, filaments or threads.  ESP ranges from 15 to 35 to a depth of 112 centimeters (44 inches) and the electrical conductivity is 4 to 8 desisiemens per meter.

The An horizon has dry colors of 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3; 2.5Y 5/2 or 6/2, and moist colors of 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3; 2.5Y 3/2, or 4/2.  It has 40 to 60 percent clay.  It has few wedge shape aggregates and few intersecting slickensides in the lower part of the A horizon.

The Cn horizon has dry colors of 10YR 6/2, 6/3; 2.5Y 6/2 or 6/4, and moist colors of 10YR 4/2, 4/3; 2.5Y 4/2 or 4/3.  Some pedons have few faint mottles and iron stains, 10YR 7/4, 6/6, or 7/6; moist color is 10YR 5/4, 4/6, or 5/6.  Texture is clay and clay loam.  ESP is 5 to 20.

Channeled and overwashed phases are also recognized, overwashed phases are loams or sandy loams about 20 to 36 centimeters (8 to 14 inches) thick.  The overwash soil material is the result of accelerated past erosion from the steeper slopes.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Notspier series.  Notspier soils are 51 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) to soft bedrock, have moist values in the upper 30 centimeters (12 inches) of less than 3.5 and are located on hills and terraces on San Clemente Island.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Jehemy soils are on marine terraces and hills and have slopes of 2 to 20 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium material derived mostly from sedimentary rock sources.  Elevation ranges from 150 to 270 meters (490 to 885 feet).  The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is about 250 to 310 millimeters (10 to 12 inches).  Mean January temperature is about 12.2 degrees C (54 degrees F), mean July temperature is about 17.8 degrees C (64 degrees F), and mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).  Frost-free season is about 365 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Nicolas, Olf and the Vizcapoint soils.  Nicolas soils are sands or loamy sands throughout the profile and are on dunes.  Olf and Vizcapoint soils have argillic horizons and are on marine terraces.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow to rapid runoff; low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for military maneuvers and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation is mostly slender oats, red brome, soft chess, Australian saltbush, and Mediterranean barley.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  San Nicolas Island, Ventura County, California.  The soils are not extensive.
