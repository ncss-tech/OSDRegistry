JULIETTE SERIES

The Juliette series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or loess influenced colluvium derived from limestone. These soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes are 30 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 600 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Xeric Calcicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Juliette gravelly loam in forestland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

  Oi--0 to 3 cm; slightly decomposed plant material. 

  A--3 to 18 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and few medium roots; common very fine and fine interstitial and few very fine and fine tubular pores; 30 percent gravel; 2 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. 

  Bk1--18 to 36 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and few medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine interstitial and few very fine and fine tubular pores; 35 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; calcium carbonate coats on bottom surfaces of rock fragments; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary. 

  Bk2--36 to 56 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; 35 percent gravel; calcium carbonate coats on bottom and side surfaces of rock fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.

  Bk3--56 to 84 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) extremely gravelly sandy loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine and few medium roots; common very fine and few fine tubular pores; 35 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles, 2 percent stones; calcium carbonate coats on all surfaces of rock fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. 

  Bkq1--84 to 119 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) extremely gravelly sandy loam, brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) moist; single grain; loose; common very fine, fine and few medium roots; few very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 60 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; calcium carbonate and silica coats on all surfaces of rock fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); gradual wavy boundary.

  Bkq2--119 to 150 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) extremely gravelly sandy loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; single grain; loose; common very fine, fine and few medium and coarse roots; few very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 45 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles; calcium carbonate coats on all surfaces of rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).
