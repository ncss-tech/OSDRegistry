JENERA SERIES

The Jenera series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in stratified loamy and silty glaciolacustrine material 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) thick and in the underlying till. They are on lake plains and in shallow lacustrine areas on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).

Centerburg, Vallonia, and Williamstown soils have less than 25 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Cygnet and Houcktown soils have a densic contact within the series control section. Jugtown soils have rock fragments of sandstone, chert, and shale lithology. Nicely, Scattersville, and Swampoodle soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 140 cm (55 inches). Reaville soils have hue redder than 10YR throughout the series control section and a lithic contact within 102 cm (40 inches). Tuscola soils do not have rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Vanlue soils have redox features with chroma of 2 or less on faces of peds in the upper part of the argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Jenera soils are on lake plains and in shallow lacustrine areas on till plains of late Wisconsin age. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. The soils formed in stratified loamy and silty glaciolacustrine material 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) thick and in the underlying till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 1067 mm (27 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 13 degrees C (45 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 170 days. Elevation is 213 to 305 meters (700 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the somewhat poorly drained Tiderishi and Vanlue soils on flats and very slight rises, and the very poorly drained Rensselaer soils in depressions and drainageways.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 30 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) between December and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is very low to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part of the solum and moderately low in the lower part and in the substratum. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and moderately slow or slow in the lower part of the solum and in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: A large proportion is under cultivation, primarily corn, soybeans, wheat, and hay. A few areas are in woods, or are used for specialty crops, such as tomatoes or sugar beets. Native vegetation is deciduous forest, principally ash, beech, elm, maple, and hickory.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 99 in northwestern Ohio, and to a lesser extent, in small lacustrine areas within MLRA 111B of west-central Ohio. The type location is in MLRA 99. The series is of small extent.
