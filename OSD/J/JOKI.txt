JOKI SERIES

The Joki series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of a sandy eolian or glaciolacustrine mantle and in the underlying clayey glaciolacustrine deposits. These soils are on flats on glacial lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 670 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy over clayey, isotic over smectitic, nonacid, frigid Aeric Endoaquents

TYPICAL PEDON: Joki loamy sand, on a flat of 1 percent, in a wooded area, on a glacial lake plain, at an elevation of about 400 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 10 centimeters; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) loamy sand, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; weak fine and moderate granular structure; very friable; common fine and very fine roots; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. (8 to 15 centimeters thick)

    Bw1--10 to 20 centimeters; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loamy sand; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; common fine and very fine roots; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary.

    Bw2--20 to 51 centimeters; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) loamy sand; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; few fine, very fine and medium roots; common medium distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; common medium faint grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) redoximorphic depletions; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary.

    Bw3--51 to 64 centimeters; variegated light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6), light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3), and grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine and very fine roots; neutral; clear broken boundary.

    Bw4--64 to 76 centimeters; olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) loamy sand; weak fine subangular structure; very friable; few fine and very fine roots; neutral; clear broken boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bw horizon ranges 50 to 100 centimeters.)

    2Cg1--76 to 173 centimeters; gray (2.5Y 5/1) clay; massive; firm; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual clear wavy boundary.

    2Cg2--173 to 188 centimeters; olive gray (5Y 5/2) silty clay loam; massive; friable; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

    2Cg3--188 to 203 centimeters; gray (5Y 5/1) clay; massive; firm; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) 88-Northern Minnesota Glacial Lake Basins; St. Louis County, Minnesota, Meadowlands subset; about 1 mile north and 0.5 miles west of Kelsey; located about 200 feet north and 1,900 feet west of the southeast corner of section 10, T. 54 N., R. 18 W.; USGS Kelsey topographic quadrangle; latitude 47 degrees 10 minutes 8 seconds N. and longitude 92 degrees 36 minutes 22 seconds W., NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
These soils do not have rock fragments
Depth to carbonates--51 to 127 centimeters
Depth to clayey sediments--50 to 100 centimeters

A or Ap horizon:
Hue--10YR
Value--2 or 3
Chroma--1 or 2
Texture--loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand, fine sand
Reaction--moderately acid to neutral

Bw or Bg horizon:
Hue--10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y
Value--4 or 5
Chroma--2 to 6
Texture--loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand, fine sand; or stratified with these textures
Reaction--moderately acid to neutral

Some pedons have thin, discontinuous loamy strata within the sandy mantle

2C or 2Cg horizon:
Hue--2.5Y or 5Y
Value--4 or 5
Chroma--1 to 3
Texture--clay, silty clay or silty clay loam
Reaction--slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--50 to 100 centimeters of sandy eolian or glaciolacustine deposits and in the underlying clayey glaciolacustrine deposits
Landform--flats on glacial lake plains
Slope--0 to 2 percent
Elevation--350 to 490 meters above sea level
Mean annual air temperature--3 to 5 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation--635 to 711 millimeters
Frost-free period--95 to 125 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aerie and McDavitt soils. 
The somewhat poorly drained Aerie soils are on more sloping and higher lying positions on the landscape.
The very poorly drained McDavitt soils are in drainageways and depressions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--poorly drained--these soils have a frequently saturated zone within a depth of 0.15 meter below the surface during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--4.23 to 141.14 micrometers per second in the upper eolian or glaciolacustrine deposits and 0.42 to 4.23 micrometers per second in the underlying clayey glaciolacustrine deposits

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are forested. Some areas are used for hay or pasture. The native vegetation is deciduous forest. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Physiographic Division--Interior Plains or Laurentian Upland
Physiographic Province--Central Lowland Province or Superior Upland
Physiographic section--Western Lake section (if in the Central Lowland Province) or undefined (if in the Superior Upland)
MLRA--Northern Minnesota Glacial Lake Basins (88)
LRR K; northern Minnesota
Extent--small

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota. 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: St. Louis County, Minnesota, 2009. The source of the name is a creek in northwestern Minnesota.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from surface of the soil to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
