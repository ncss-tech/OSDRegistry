JANA SERIES

The Jana series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium and residuum derived from conglomerate, sandstone and shale.  Jana soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 30 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Typic Haploxerepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jana very gravelly loam, on a southwest facing, convex, 35 percent slope in juniper woodland at an elevation of 6,100 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on September 24, 1996, the soil was dry throughout.

    The surface is covered by 40 percent gravel and 10 percent cobble.

    A1--0 to 1 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) very gravelly loam; brown (7.5YR 5/3) dry; weak fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 30 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary (1 to 4 inches thick).

    A2--1 to 6 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/3) very gravelly loam; light brown (7.5YR 6/3) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 30 percent gravel, and 10 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary (3 to 7 inches thick). 

    Bw--6 to 12 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) extremely cobbly loam;  light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 40 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt irregular boundary (6 to 10 inches thick).

    Cr--12 inches; fractured soft sandstone bedrock

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no currently no series in this family.  The Heiners series, in a closely related family, has a frigid soil temperature regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  Slope alluvium, colluvium and residuum derived from conglomerate, sandstone and shale.
Landform:  Mountain slopes
Slopes:  30 to 70 percent
Elevation: 5,600 to 7,400 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  45 to 48 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  14 to 16 inches.
  Wettest months:  March through May
  Driest months:  July through September
Frost-free period:  100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dastrup, Fewkes and Richsum.  
  Dastrup:  Very deep soils on fan remnants
  Fewkes:  Very deep  soils on mountain slopes
  Richsum:  Deep soils on mountain slopes

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, medium to high runoff, moderate to moderately rapid permeability.  

USE AND VEGETATION:  Use is livestock grazing.  Vegetation is Utah juniper, wheatgrass, bluegrass, and cliffrose.  In Utah this series is in a Upland Shallow Loam (Utah Juniper) woodland site.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North Central Utah.  LRR E, MLRA 47.  This series is of moderate extent.
