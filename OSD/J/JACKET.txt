JACKET SERIES

The Jacket series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and material weathered from basalt.  Jacket soils are on hills on plateaus, benches, broad ridges and footslopes in canyons. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Permeability is slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the average annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Pachic Ultic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jacket silt loam - on a 38 percent northeast-facing slope at 2,500 feet elevation in forest.  Described on October 9, 1975.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; slightly to moderately decomposed organic material, neutral (pH 7.0). (0 to 2 inches thick)

    A1--2 to 10 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate very fine and fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and few coarse roots; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    A2--10 to 19 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and few coarse roots; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 16 inches thick)

    Bt1--19 to 25 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common faint clay films on faces of peds; common fine and few coarse roots; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 9 inches thick)

    Bt2--25 to 32 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) silty clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common faint clay films on faces of peds; common fine and few coarse roots; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt3--32 to 52 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structures parting to moderate very fine angular blocky; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; continuous prominent clay film on faces of peds; few fine roots; few quartz sand grains; few basalt gravel and cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 30 inches thick)

    Bt4--52 to 65 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate very fine angular blocky and weak medium subangular blocky structure; continuous prominent clay films on faces of peds; few fine roots; few quartz sand grains; few basalt gravel and cobbles; common slickensides; slightly acid (pH 6.2).

TYPE LOCATION:  Idaho County, Idaho; about 4 miles southwest of White Bird, Idaho; about 1,500 feet south and 700 feet east of the northwest corner of section 4, T. 27 N., R. 1 E. (Latitude - 45 degrees, 42 minutes, 37 seconds North; Longitude - 116 degrees, 20 minutes, 40 seconds West;  USGS Slate Creek Quadrangle).

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Mollic epipedon - 20 to 35 inches
Base saturation (in some part between 10 and 30 inches) - 50 to 75 percent
Solum thickness - 40 to 60 inches
Moisture control section - dry mid-July to mid-September - 45 to 60 days.
Average annual soil temperature - 47 to 54 degrees F.

Particle-size control section
Clay content - averages 35 to 55 percent

A horizon
Hue - 10YR or 7.5YR
Value - 2 to 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma - 1 to 3, dry or moist
Clay content - 22 to 26 percent
Rock fragments - 0 to 5 percent gravel
Reaction - slightly acid to slightly alkaline

Bt horizon (AB and 2Bt horizons when present)
Hue - 10YR or 7.5YR
Value - 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma - 2 to 6, dry or moist
Textures - SICL, CL, SIC, GR-SIC, or GR-SICL
Clay content - 27 to 50 percent (the upper part of the argillic horizon averages more than 35 percent clay)
Coarse fragment content - 0 to 25 percent
Reaction - moderately acid to slightly alkaline

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Aradaran (T) and Bogus series.  Aradaran soils lack an Oi horizon and are dry for 60 to 90 days.  Bogus soils have a paralithic contact of weathered tuff at 60 to 80 inches and are dry for 60 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jacket soils are on hills on plateaus, benches, broad ridges and footslopes within canyons. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  They formed in loess and residuum and colluvium weathered from Columbia River basalt.  Elevations are 1,000 to 5,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid with warm summers and cold winters.  Average annual precipitation is 22 to 30 inches.  Average January temperature is 27 degrees F.; average July temperature is 67 degrees F.  Average annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 90 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bluesprin, Ferdinand and Klickson series.  Bluesprin soils are on canyon sides and are moderately deep.  Ferdinand soils are on plateaus and canyon sides and have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Klickson soils are on canyon sides and have a average annual soil temperature colder than 47 degrees F.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to very rapid runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for hay, pasture, barley and winter wheat.  Some areas are used for timber production, and livestock grazing.  Potential natural vegetation is mainly ponderosa pine, black hawthorn, common snowberry, rose, Idaho fescue, and cinquefoil.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Idaho.  This series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Idaho County, Idaho, 1976.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - the zone from 2 to 25 inches (A1, A2, and Bt1 horizons).

Argillic horizon - the zone from 19 to 65 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 and Bt4 horizons)

Particle-size control section - the zone from 19 to 39 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and part of the Bt3 horizon).

Depths to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral layer.
