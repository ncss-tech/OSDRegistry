JESH SERIES

The Jesh series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from andesite.  Jesh soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 3 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, smectitic, frigid Vertic Palexerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jesh silt loam, on a east facing, concave to concave, 6 percent slope in mountain big sagebrush at an elevation of 5,560 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    A--0 to 12 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine and very fine granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, few fine roots; many very fine, few fine tubular and interstitial pores; few 5 to 30 mm wide cracks extending to 30 inches; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (8 to 17 inches thick)

    Bt1--12 to 19 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to strong medium and fine angular blocky; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; many very fine and few fine tubular pores; many discontinuous prominent clay films on ped faces; common vertical oriented dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) organic stains 5 to 20 mm wide; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary.

    Btk1--30 to 37 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong medium and fine angular blocky structure; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common discontinuous distinct clay films on ped faces; few vertical oriented dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) organic stains 5 to 10 mm wide; slightly effervescent, (5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are segregated in few fine and medium irregular shaped soft masses; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (7 to 30 inches thick)

    Btk2--37 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine and very fine angular blocky; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; common discontinuous dinstinct clay films on ped faces; slightly effervescent, (6 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are segregated in few fine and medium irregular shaped soft masses; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Booth (OR), Campcreek (OR), Carryback (OR), Crowcamp (OR), Lacrol T (ID), Tippett T (OR), or Zumwalt T (OR) series.

Booth and Carryback soils are moderately deep to bedrock.

Campcreek soils have 2Bt horizons, 35 to 45 percent gravel in the surface horizon, and has a xeric bordering on aridic moisture regime.

Crowcamp soils have an aridic moisture regime, a mollic horizon that is 20 to 30 inches, and are somewhat poorly drained.

Lacrol soils have a perched water table at 10 to 20 inches in depth.

Tippett and Zumwalt soils have bedrock at 40 to 60 inches in depth.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jesh soils.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Tickville, Melling, and Beefhollow series.  

Tickville soils are moderately deep to bedrock and are under oak.  

Melling soils are shallow and are on backslopes.  

Beefhollow soils have less clay in the pscs, are under oak and are on back slopes.
