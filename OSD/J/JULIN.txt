JULIN SERIES

The Julin series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or residuum derived from semiconsolidated acid shales.  These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, acid, frigid Aridic Ustorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Julin silty clay, grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A1--0 to 2 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) silty clay, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, sticky and very plastic; many medium, fine, and very fine roots; 5 percent soft shale fragments; 5 percent hard shale fragments; very strongly acid (pH 4.6); clear wavy boundary.

    A2--2 to 7 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) silty clay, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, friable, sticky and very plastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine pores; 5 percent soft shae fragments; 5 percent hard shale fragments; very strongly acid (pH 4.6); clear wavy boundary. (Combined A horizons are 4 to 7 inches thick.)

    C1--7 to 25 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) silty clay, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, friable, sticky and very plastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; 40 percent soft shale fragments; 10 percent hard shale fragments; extremely acid (pH 4.4); clear wavy boundary. (7 to 28 inches thick)

    C2--25 to 30 inches; gray (5Y 5/1) silty clay, very dark gray (5Y 3/1) moist; massive; very hard, very firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few medium and coarse roots mainly between plates of shale; 60 percent soft shale fragments; 25 percent hard shale fragments; extremely acid (pH 4.4); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick)

    Cr--30 to 60 inches; gray (5Y 5/1) semiconsolidated shale, very dark gray (2.5Y 3/1) moist; extremely hard; sulphur coating on some shale fragments; extremely acid (pH 4.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Fergus County, Montana; about 1,320 feet north and 2,000 feet west of the SE corner of sec. 30, T. 16 N., R. 22 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil temperature - 44 to 47 degrees F.

Moisture control section - between 4 and 12 inches, dry in all parts between four-tenths and five-tenths of the cumulative days per year when the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is higher than 41 degrees F.

Depth to bedrock - 20 to 40 inches.

Dark colors (low chroma) are inherited from the acid shale.


A horizons - Hue:  10YR to 5Y

Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist

Chroma:  1, 2, or 3

Texture:  silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam

Clay content:  35 to 60 percent

Rock fragments:  0 to 60 percent shale fragments--5 to 45 percent soft shale, 5 to 15 percent hard shale

Reaction:  pH 3.6 to 5.5


C horizons - Hue:  10YR through 5Y

Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist

Chroma:  1, 2, or 3

Texture:  silty clay or clay

Clay content:  40 to 60 percent

Rock fragments:  50 to 85 percent shale fragments--45 to 60 percent soft shale, 5 to 25 percent hard shale

Reaction:  pH 3.6 to 5.5


Cr horizon - semiconsolidated shale

Reaction:  pH 3.6 to 5.5

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - sedimentary plains and hills.

Elevation - 2,800 to 3,800 feet.

Slope - 2 to 25 percent.

Parent material - alluvium or residuum derived from semiconsolidated acid shale.

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers.

Mean annual air temperature - 42 to 45 degrees F.

Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 14 inches.

Frost-free period - 115 to 135 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Julin soils are used mainly for rangeland.  Potential native vegetation is mainly prairie sandreed, western wheatgrass, big sagebrush, Rosa species, goldenrod, and other perennial forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Julin soils are of small extent in central and southeastern Montana.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Fergus County, Montana, 1979.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations records:  MT0326, MT8176.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to a depth of 7 inches (A1 and A2 horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 30 inches (C1 and C2 horizons).   Julin soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.

Classification changed from Ustic Torriorthents to Aridic Ustorthents in 1994.
