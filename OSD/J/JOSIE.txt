JOSIE SERIES

The Josie series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils with moderately rapid permeability that formed in colluvium and residuum from granitic rocks mixed with volcanic ash. Slopes range from 8 to 60 percent in mountains. The average annual precipitation is about 32 inches and the average annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, isotic Vitrixerandic Humicryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Josie fine gravelly ashy sandy loam -- on a south-facing slope of 10 percent on a broad mountain ridge at 7,100 feet elevation in open forestland. Described in 1964. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(2 to 10 inches thick)

   A2--7 to 13 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) fine gravelly ashy sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine irregular and tubular pores; 15 percent angular fine gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.2); gradual wavy boundary. (8 to 15 inches thick)

   Bw1--13 to 24 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) fine gravelly ashy coarse sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak very fine and fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many very fine interstitial and tubular pores; 15 percent angular fine gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.2); gradual wavy boundary. (8 to 20 inches thick)

   Bw2--24 to 42 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very cobbly ashy coarse sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak very fine and fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; many very fine irregular and common very fine tubular pores; 12 percent angular gravel and 30 percent angular cobbles; strongly acid (pH 5.3); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 20 inches thick)

   C--42 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very cobbly ashy loamy coarse sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine irregular and few very fine tubular pores; 25 percent angular fine gravel and 30 percent angular cobbles; strongly acid (pH 5.2).

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Marmotland (T) series. This series is not currently in the database and cannot be competed. The Zan series has a similar classification.  The Zan soils are in a sandy family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Josie soils are strongly sloping to very steep on exposed mountain slopes and ridges at elevations of 6,000 to 8,500 feet. Slopes range from 8 to 60 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from granitic rocks mixed with volcanic ash. Average annual precipitation is 28 to 45 inches. Average annual temperature is 35 to 39 degrees F. Frost-free period is 15 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Coski, Hanks and Zimmer soils. Coski soils have a mollic epipedon and an O horizon. Hanks soils do not have an umbric epipedon and have an O horizon. Coski and Hanks soils are on less exposed geomorphic positions. Zimmer soils are shallow to bedrock and on similar geomorphic positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Josie soils are used mainly for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is subalpine big sagebrush, mountain brome, needlegrasses, lupine, eriogonum and arrowleaf balsamroot.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West-central Idaho. MLRA 43b. Joise soils are moderately extensive.
