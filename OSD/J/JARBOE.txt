JARBOE SERIES

The Jarboe series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium derived from limestone, shale, tuff andesite, basalt and sandstone.  Jarboe soils are on concave basins or lake-formed terraces.  Slopes are less than 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 175 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, carbonatic, mesic Petronodic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Jarboe sandy loam--rangeland (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 8 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; strong thin platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; very few fine and medium roots; many fine and medium vesicular pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.7); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 10 cm thick)

    A2--8 to 15 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and medium roots; many fine vesicular pores; violently effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 13 cm thick)

(13 to 23 cm thick)

    Bk2--33 to 58 cm; white (10YR 8/1) extremely paragravelly silty clay loam, very pale brown (10YR 8/2) moist; weak medium angular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots in cracks between aggregates; many shells about 1 mm long and 2 mm in diameter; discontinuous (75%) strongly carbonate-cemented lenses; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.9); clear irregular boundary. (18 to 60 cm thick)

    C--58 to 168 cm; white (5Y 8/1), pale yellow (5Y 8/2) silt loam, light gray (5Y 7/2) moist; few fine distinct light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) and reddish brown (5YR 4/4) iron mottles; massive; very hard, firm, nonsticky and slightly plastic; very few fine roots; common fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jarboe soils are concave basins or lake-formed terraces at elevations of 1,370 to 1,680 meters.  Slopes are less than 1 percent. The soils formed in lacustrine materials derived from mixed rocks including limestone, shale, tuff, andesite, basalt and sandstone. These materials have been modified by carbonate precipitated from evaporating ground water. The climate is cool, semiarid with a mean annual precipitation of 150 to 200 mm. The mean annual temperature 11 to 13 degrees C and the average frost-free period is 130 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aysees, Cliffdown, Kawich, Papoose, and Timper soils. Aysees soils have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections; Cliffdown soils have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections; and Kawich soils have sandy particle-size control sections. Papoose soils have sandy clay loam argillic horizons. Timper soils have indurated duripans.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well-drained; these soils were formed under more poorly drained conditions than exist today.  Evaporation of the lake waters and subsequent lowering of the water table has improved the natural drainage. Very slow runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for livestock grazing. Vegetation is mainly salt and alkali-tolerant plants that are dominated by greasewood, fourwing saltbush, and gray molly.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Nevada. MLRA 29.  The soil is inextensive.
