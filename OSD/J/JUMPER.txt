JUMPER SERIES

The Jumper series consist of deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy and sandy marine sediments.  These soils are on uplands of central Florida.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, siliceous, semiactive, hyperthermic Arenic Plinthaquic Paleudults

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jumper fine sand - forested. (Colors are for moist soil.)

     Ap--0 to 6 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) fine sand, weak fine granular structure; few fine roots; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

     E1--6 to 15 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) sand; few fine distinct dark gray (10YR 4/1), few fine faint light gray (10YR 7/1), and few fine prominent yellowish red (5YR 5/8) mottles; single grained; loose; few fine medium roots;  yellowish  red  mottles  are  firm;  strongly acid;  gradual  wavy boundary.

     E2--15 to 29 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) sand; few fine faint white (10YR 8/1), gray (10YR 5/1), and yellow (10YR 7/6) and few fine prominent yellowish red (5YR 5/8) mottles; single grained; loose; yellowish red mottles are firm; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (Thickness of the E horizon is 12 to 36 inches.)

     Bt1--29 to 33 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy clay loam; few medium distinct light gray (10YR 7/1) and strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) and few fine prominent yellowish red (5YR 5/8) mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; sand grains located and bridged with clay; yellowish red mottles are firm; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

     Bt2--33 to 53  inches; pale brown  (10YR 6/3)  sandy clay loam; few medium yellowish red (5YR 5/8), common medium gray (10YR 6/1), and few fine red (10R 5/8) mottles; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; few fine roots; thin discontinuous clay films on faces of peds; red mottles are firm; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (Thickness of the Bt horizon is 8 to 40 inches.)

     Btv--53 to 80 inches; mottled gray (10YR 6/1), yellowish brown (10YR 5/8), and dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) sandy clay loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few discontinuous clay films on faces of peds; about 12 percent by volume of nodule plinthite; strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Marion County, Florida, about 2 miles east of Fort McCoy on State Road 316, and 1/2 mile south of road; NW1/4NE1/4 sec.  13, T. 13 S., R. 23 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 72 inches.  Depth to the Bt horizon is 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the Btv horizon is 28 to 57 inches.  The soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand.

The E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 4 with few to common mottles in varying shades of gray, brown, yellow, or red.  It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.

The Bt horizon has hue of lOYR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8 with few to common mottles in varying shades of brown, gray, or red.  Texture is sandy loam or sandy clay loam.

The Btv horizon is mottled in varying shades of red, brown, yellow, or gray, or it has a gray matrix with mottles in varying shades of brown, yellow, or red.  Texture is sandy clay loam.  Content of plinthite ranges from 5 to 15 by volume.

BC or CB horizons, where present, have colors similar to the Btv horizon.  These horizons are sandy clay loam with lense and pockets of finer or coarser material.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other know series in the same family.  Competing series in other families include the Braden, Kendrick, Lochloosa, Millhopper, and Sparr  series.  These series do not have as much as 5 percent plinthite.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jumper soils are on nearly level to gently sloping uplands of Peninsular Florida.  The soil formed in unconsolidated loamy and sandy marine sediments.  Near the type location the mean annual temperature is 72 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 59 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Lochloosa and Sparr series and the Adamsville, Apopka, and Tavares series.  Lochloosa, Sparr,  and  Adamsville  soils  are  on  similar  landscape positions.  In addition to not having as much as 5 percent plinthite, Adamsville and Sparr soils are sandy to a depth of more than 40 inches.  Apopka and Tavares soils are on higher landscape positions, do not have plinthite, and are sandy to a depth of more than 40 inches.

DRAINAGE  AND  PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; moderately  slow permeability.  Runoff is slow.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Cleared areas are used for citrus, corn, peanuts, watermelons, tomatoes, and improved pasture.  Native vegetation consists of loblolly, slash, and longleaf pines, water and willow oaks, and sweetbay and  magnolia  with  an  understory  of  bluestem, panicums,  American beautyberry, greenbrier, grapes, and other vines.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Peninsular Florida.  The series is of moderate extent.
