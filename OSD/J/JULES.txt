JULES SERIES

The Jules series consists of deep, well drained or moderately well drained soils formed in calcareous, stratified silty alluvium.  They are on alluvial fans or flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 11.7 degrees C (53 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Typic Udifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jules silt loam - with a slope of less than one percent in a cultivated field.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Ap--0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam with some yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) peds, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; friable; few very fine roots; common faint very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) organic coatings on faces of peds; slightly  effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  [0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 inches) thick]

   C1--20 to 46 cm (8 to 18 inches); stratified dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam with very thin strata of loam; thin bedding planes along strata; massive; friable; few very fine roots; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  [13 to 76 cm (5 to 30 inches) thick]

   C2--46 to 81 cm (18 to 32 inches); stratified dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam with thin strata of very fine sandy loam and loam; thin bedding planes along strata; massive; friable; few very fine roots; slightlt effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  [0 to 51 cm (0 to 20 inches) thick]

   C3--81 to 117 cm (32 to 46 inches); stratified dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam with this strata of loamy sand and loam; thin bedding planes along strata; massive; friable; slightly effervescent moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  [0 to 51 cm (0 to 20 inches) thick]

   C4--117 to 152 cm (46 to 60 inches); stratified brown (10YR 4/3), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam with thin strata of loamy sand and loam; thin bedding planes along strata; massive; friable; common fine soft accumulations (iron and manganese oxides); slightly effervescete; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Peoria County, Illinois; about 12 miles northwest of Peoria; 2,200 ft. east and 75 south of the northwest corner of section 36, T. 10 N., R. 6 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Thickness of the solum; 25 cm (10 inches) or less, and is the same thickness as the Ap or A horizon. 
Depth to free carbonates; less than 25 cm (10 inches0
Depth to free carbonates: present throughout the particle-size control section.

Ap or A horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: predominantly silt loam, but loam is included in the range.

C horizon;
Hue: 10YR
Value: 3 to 5
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture; dominantly silt loam or silt, but thin strata of loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand or sand or the fine and very fine analogues of the latter two textures are in some pedons.
Content of total sand: 5 to 20 percent
Other features:
Some pedons are mottled below a depth of 25 cm (10 inches), but no layer within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches) is saturated at any time during the year except during periods of flooding.  Some pedons contain dark colored buried soils that contain more clay below a depth of 102 cm (40 inches).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are Zeandale series.  Zeandale soils are on floodplain step. Other similar soils are Arenzville, Bold, Chaseburg, Dorchester, Haymond, Haynie, and McPaul series.  Arenzville, Chaseburg, and Haymond soils are noncalcareous.  Bold soils are not stratified.  Dorchester soils contain more clay in the control section.  Haynie and McPaul soils have darker surface horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jules soils are on flood plains and on alluvial fans where tributary streams enter river flood plains.  Slope gradients are less than 2 percent.  Jules soils formed in relatively unaltered stratified, calcareous alluvium washed from soils formed in loess on nearby uplands.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.0 to 13.3 degrees C (50 to 56 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 838 to 1118 mm (33 to 44 inches).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arenzville, Dorchester, Haymond, Landes, Lawson, Sarpy, and Wakeland soils.  Arenzville, Dorchester and Haymond soils are on similar parts of the flood plains nearby.  Landes and Sarpy soils contain more sand in the control section and are on natural levees or low rises on the flood plains.  Lawson soils have a mollic epipedon and contain more clay.  They are on lower parts of the flood plain nearby.  Wakeland soils are Aeric Fluvaquents and are on lower parts of the flood plain nearby.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained and moderately well drained.  Surface runoff is slow.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are cropped.  Corn, soybeans, and small grain are the principal crops.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  MLRAs 108B, 111C, 111D, 113, 114A, 114B, 115A, 115C, and 121 along major streams in southern and western Illinois, and in Indiana and Ohio.  Extent is moderate.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Cass County, Illinois, 1939.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 20 cm (8 inches) (Ap horizon); calcareous reaction class - effervescent in all parts at depths between 25 to 51 cm (10 and 20 inches); a udic soil moisture regime.
