JETMINE SERIES


The Jetmine series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium from rhyolite and metamorphic sources. Jetmine soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 59 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic, shallow Cambidic Haplodurids

TYPICAL PEDON: Jetmine sandy loam, rangeland and wildlife habitat. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered by approximately 50 percent pebbles and 2 percent cobbles. 

	A--0 to 2 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak thick platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine and few fine interstitial pores; 10 percent pebbles; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 4 inches thick) 

	Bk--2 to 16 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, few fine and medium roots; common very fine and few fine interstitial and tubular pores; common thin calcium carbonate coats on undersides of rock fragments; 10 percent pebbles; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (10 to 16 inches thick) 

	Bqkm--16 to 60 inches; white (10YR 8/1) weakly cemented duripan, very pale brown (10YR 8/3) moist; massive; hard, very firm, brittle; few very fine roots; discontinuous weak silica and calcium carbonate cementated; 1 millimeter laminar cap; 20 percent discontinuous strong cementation in the upper part; greater than four inches between fractures with few very fine roots in fractures; violently effervescent. 

TYPE LOCATION: Clark County, Nevada; approximately 3 1/2 miles north of Searchlight, NV in the south end of Eldorado Valley; about 2810 feet south and 1000 feet east of the northwest corner of section 12, T. 28 S., R. 63 E.; USGS Nelson SW, NV 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; 35 degrees, 31 minutes, 24 seconds north latitude and 114 degrees, 53 minutes, 52 seconds west longitude; UTM 11s, 690615e, 3933112n; NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil moisture - Usually dry, moist in some part for short periods during winter and early spring and for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July to October following convection storms. 

Soil temperature - 59 to 63 degrees F. 

Depth to duripan - 14 to 20 inches. 

Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline. 

Control section - Percent clay: 8 to 17 percent. 

Rock fragments: 5 to 30 percent mainly gravel. 

A horizon(s) - Value: 5 or 6 dry. 

Bk horizon - Value: 4 or 5 moist. 
Texture: Sandy loam or fine sandy loam. 
Rock fragments: 5 to 30 percent, mainly gravel. 

Bqkm horizon - Weakly to strongly silica and calcium carbonate cemented. 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Crackerjack and Lewdlac series. The Crackerjack soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 63 to 72 degrees F. and depth to duripan is 10 to 14 inches. The Lewdlac soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 63 to 69 degrees F. and the duripan is 5 to 10 inches thick.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Jetmine soils are on fan remnants. These soils formed in mixed alluvium from rhyolite and metamorphic sources. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent. Elevations are 3,000 to 4,300 feet. The climate is hot and arid with warm, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 7 inches; mean annual air temperature is 57 to 61 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 180 to 240 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Lanip and Tenwell series. Lanip and Tenwell soils have argillic horizons and fine-loamy textural control sections. Also, Tenwell soils are moderately deep to an indurated duripan. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly blackbrush, creosotebush, Joshua tree and Spanish dagger. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southern Nevada. MLRA 30. These soils are not extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Clark County Area, Nevada, 2006. Proposed in  Clark County, Nevada, 1994. The name is coined from Jet Mine located about 1 1/2 miles to the south. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

Ochric epipedon - 0 to 7 inches (A and part of the Bk horizons). 

Duripan - 16 to 60 inches (Bqkm horizon). 

Particle-size control section - 10 to 16 inches (Part of the Bk horizon). 

Responsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 4/2015. The last revision to the series was 7/2006. ET
