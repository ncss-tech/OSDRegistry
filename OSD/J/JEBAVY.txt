JEBAVY SERIES

The Jebavy series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that are shallow to cemented subsoil. These soils formed in glaciofluvial deposits on lake plains and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic, shallow, ortstein Typic Duraquods

TYPICAL PEDON: Jebavy sand, on a 1 percent slope on a lake plain in a wooded area at an elevation of about (780 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

 A--0 to 10 cm (4 inches); black (10YR 2/1) sand, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; weak fine and medium granular structure; very friable; common fine and medium roots; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. [2 to 10 cm (1 to 4 inches) thick]

 E1--10 to 38 cm (4 to 15 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sand, white (10YR 8/1) dry; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; very friable; few fine roots; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. 

 E2--38 to 43 cm (15 to 17 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) sand, light gray (10YR 7/1) dry; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; very friable; few fine roots; few fine faint light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) iron depletions; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the E horizon is 15 to 41 cm (6 to 16 inches).]

 Bhsm1--43 to 66 cm (17 to 26 inches); reddish black (2.5YR 2.5/1) sand; massive; firm; few fine roots matted at the top of the horizon; more than 90 percent of the horizon occupied by moderately cemented ortstein in a horizontal pattern; few fine prominent red (2.5YR 4/8) iron accumulations; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. 

 Bhsm2--66 to 79 cm (26 to 31 inches); dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) sand; massive; firm; more than 90 percent of the horizon occupied by strongly cemented ortstein in a horizontal pattern; strongly acid abrupt smooth boundary. [Combined depth of the Bhsm horizon is 20 to 36 cm (8 to 14 inches).]

 C--79 to 203 cm (31 to 80 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) fine sand; massive; very friable; moderately acid.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Saugatuck series. Saugatuck soils are saturated for fewer than 90 days when the soil temperature exceeds 5 degrees C. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Jebavy soils are on lake plains and outwash plains. Slope is 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in glaciofluvial deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 965 mm (30 to 38 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.3 to 9.4 degrees C (47 to 49 degrees F). Elevation is 183 to 244 meters (600 to 800 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the somewhat poorly drained Pipestone and Saugatuck soils, the very poorly drained Kingsville soils, and the moderately well drained Covert soils. The Pipestone, Kingsville, and Covert soils do not have ortstein that is at least weakly cemented when moist in more than half of each pedon. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained. Depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (1.0 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1.0 foot) below for more than 120 days and from 90 to 120 days when soil temperature exceeds 5 degrees C at some time between October and June. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the ortstein and high or very high in the rest of the profile. Permeability is moderate in the ortstein and rapid in the rest of the profile. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in forest. A small acreage is under cultivation to blueberries. Principal tree species include red maple, quaking aspen, eastern white pine, jack pine and eastern hemlock. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 96, 98, and 101 in west central Lower Peninsula of Michigan and central New York. The series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Newaygo County, Michigan, 1990. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 43 cm (17 inches) (A and E horizons). 
Albic horizon: from a depth of 10 to 35 cm (4 to 15 inches) (E1 horizon).
Spodic horizon: from a depth of 43 to 79 cm (17 to 31 inches) (Bhsm horizon).
Continuous ortstein (90 percent or more): from a depth of 43 to 79 cm (17 to 31 inches) (Bhsm horizon).

Soils previously correlated as Saugatuck in Newaygo Country were changed to the name Jebavy in the second amendment, dated May 21, 1991, to the Classification and Correlation of Newaygo County, Michigan. The series was proposed in Mason County, Michigan in 1991.
