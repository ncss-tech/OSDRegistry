JAGERSON SERIES

The Jagerson series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium from mixed volcanic sources.  The Jagerson soils are on fan terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Calciargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Jagerson gravelly sandy clay loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 2 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine platy structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 15 percent gravel; noneffervescent, slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick)

    Bt1--2 to 9 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, sticky and plastic; few faint clay skins lining pores; common fine and very fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 9 inches thick)

    2Bk2--42 to 60 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few very fine pores; 55 percent gravel, 10 percent cobble; many prominent calcium carbonate coatings on all sides of rock fragments; violently effervescent, 8 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

TYPE LOCATION: Detrital Valley, Mohave County, Arizona; Latitude of 35 degrees, 26 minutes, 29 seconds North, and longitude of 114 degrees, 22 minutes, 54 seconds West. About 1,500 feet west and 1,900 feet south of the northeast corner of section 26, T.24 N., R. 20 W. Gila and Salt River Base Meridian.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture: Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during December - February and for less than 20 days cumulative during July - September.  Driest during May and June.  Typic aridic soil moisture regime.

Soil temperature: 59 to 72 degrees F.

Rock fragments: averages 15 to 34 percent rock fragments in the control section and 35 to 65 percent below.  A surface gravel layer is common, ranging from 10 to 25 percent

Depth to a calcic horizon: 15 to 30 inches

Depth to base of argillic horizon: 14 to 24 inches

Clay content: Averages 18 to 35 percent in the control section

Organic Matter: less than 1 percent


A horizon

Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR

Value: 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist

Chroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist

Effervescence: noneffervescent to slightly effervescent


Bt horizons

Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR

Value: 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist

Chroma: 4 through 6, dry or moist

Texture: sandy clay loam, clay loam

Effervescence: noneffervscent to strongly effervescent


Bk horizons

Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Blackmagic (CA), Cornville (AZ), Dona Ana (NM), Elizario (NM), Hap (NM), Kidwell (NV), Madurez (NM), Mcnew (NM), Mohave (AZ), Nutt (NM), Poachie (AZ) and Tres Hermanos (NM) series.  Blackmagic, Cornville, Dona Ana, Elizario, Madurez, Mcnew, Mohave, Nutt, and Poachie soils average less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  In addition, Dona Ana, Madurez and Mohave soils are moist for more than 20 days cumulative during July-September.  Hap, Kidwell, and Tres Hermanos soils have more than 15 percent calcium carbonate in the argillic horizon.  In addition, the Hap soils are moist for more than 20 days cumulative during July-September.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Jagerson soils are on fan terraces at elevations of 3,000 to 3,500 feet.  Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent.  These soils formed in mixed volcanic alluvium.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 200 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Nealy and Zibate soils.  Nealy soils have a duripan at depths between 20 and 40 inches.  Zibate soils have volcanic bedrock at depths of 20 inches or less.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low runoff; moderate or moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation includes Mohave yucca, big galleta, range ratany, and Anderson wolfberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Arizona.  Jagerson soils are of moderate extent.  MLRA is 30.
