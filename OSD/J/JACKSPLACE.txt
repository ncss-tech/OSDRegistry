JACKSPLACE SERIES

The Jacksplace series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and residuum derived from basalt. Jacksplace soils are on lava plateaus and summits of hills. Slopes are 1 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cabinspring, Cagas, Derallo, Glassbutte, Roughridge, and Slockey series. 

Cabinspring soils are dominated by gravel and average 35 to 45 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Cagas soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts. Derallo soils are deep to paralithic contacts. Glassbutte soils are very deep. Rough ridge soils are 150 to 200 cm to a paralithic contact of andesite.  Slockey soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and September due to convection storms. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Jacksplace soils are on lava plateaus and summits of hills. These soils formed in volcanic ash and residuum derived from basalt. Slopes are 1 to 20 percent. Elevation ranges from 1,310 to 1,830 meters. The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 360 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C  The frost-free period is 50 to 80 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hayespring, Milcan, Moonbeam, and Senra soils. Hayespring soils are fine-loamy, have isotic mineralogy, and are moderately deep to duripans. Milcan soils are ashy, moderately deep to duripans, and do not have argillic horizons. Moonbeam soil are clayey and are shallow to duripans. Senra soils are ashy and are shallow to duripans. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium surface runoff; moderate permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Jacksplace soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The vegetation consists of mountain big sagebrush, western juniper, Idaho fescue, Thurber's needlegrass, and Indian ricegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Oregon. These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 23.
