JONESCREEK SERIES  

The Jonescreek series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium or outwash from mixed sources.  These soils occur on flood plains, flood plain steps, stream terraces, and outwash terraces.  Slopes are 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed Oxyaquic Cryofluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Jonescreek very cobbly sandy loam, in riparian forest on a 3 percent slope at an elevation of 1600 meters (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

     A--0 to 13 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine, and few medium roots; few very fine and fine irregular pores; 25 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones; strongly effervescent; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 15 cm thick)

     C1--13 to 36 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely cobbly loamy sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; single grain; loose; many very fine and fine, and few medium roots; 40 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones; violently effervescent; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary.

     C2--36 to 73 cm variegated extremely cobbly sand; single grain; loose; common very fine and fine roots; 25 percent gravel, 40 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones; violently effervescent; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary.

     C3--73 to 150 cm; variegated extremely cobbly sand; single grain; loose; few very fine and fine roots; 20 percent gravel, 40 percent cobbles, and 20 percent stones; violently effervescent; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4). (combined thickness of C horizons is more than 135 cm)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: somewhat poorly drained, rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Jonescreek soils are used mainly for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  The vegetation is mainly low to moderate tree canopy (less than 30 percent) riparian forest; species include: Timothy, Poa sp., Bromus sp., Carex sp., Columbia needlegrass, yellow avens, yarrow, bearberry, russet buffaloberry, snowberry, silverberry, serviceberry, wild rose, common juniper, chokecherry, Douglas-fir, quaking aspen, black cottonwood, and lodgepole pine; as well as other miscellaneous grasses, forbs, and shrubs.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Jonescreek soils are of limited extent in central Montana.  MLRA 43B.

SERIES PROPOSED: Teton County, Montana, 2014.  Jonescreek series is named for the west fork drainage of Jones Creek on the Mount Wright topographic quadrangle.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 13 cm (A horizon)
Particle-size control section - from 25 to 100 cm (part of C1, C2, and part of C3 horizons)

Jonescreek soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
