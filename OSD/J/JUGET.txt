JUGET SERIES

The Juget series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in thin noncalcareous very gravelly coarse-textured materials weathered from granite bedrock. Juget soils are on mountain side slopes, hills, and ridges. Slopes range from 6 to about 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 510 cm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Lithic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:Juget very gravelly sandy loam - grassland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 15 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) very gravelly sandy loam, black (10YR 2/1) when moist; weak, very fine, granular structure; soft, very friable; 60 percent gravel and stone; slightly acid; clear, smooth boundary. (10 to 20 cm thick)

    C--15 to 28 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loamy sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) when moist; massive; hard, friable; about 80 percent fine gravel; slightly acid; clear, wavy boundary. (10 to 25 cm thick)

    R--28 cm; hard granite bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:Boulder County, Colorado; 774 meters north and 198 meters east of the southwest corner, sec. 11, T. 1 N., R. 71 W.; Boulder USGS topographic quadrangle; lat. 40 degrees, 3 minutes, 56 seconds N. and long. 105 degrees, 19 minutes, 5 seconds W.; NAD 83

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Mean annual soil temperature - 0 to 7 degrees C
Mean summer soil temperature - 15 to 21 degrees C
Depth to lithic contact - 25 to 50 cm to hard granite bedrock
Mollic epipedon thickness - 18 to 50 cm
Depth to lithic contact - 18 to 50 cm
Organic carbon content - 0.6 to 2 percent, decreasing uniformly with increasing depth
Base saturation - 60 to 100 percent
Reaction: slightly acid to neutral (pH 6.1 to 7.3) throughout

Particle-size control section:
Clay content - less than 17 percent
Texture - very gravelly sand or loamy sand, excluding loamy very fine sand
Rock fragment content - 35 to 80 percent, mostly gravel and cobbles of granite lithology
Note: These soils have a high proportion of medium and coarse angular sand in the sand fraction. Packing patterns tend to be cubical and horizons of low organic matter content have an unusually great differential in consistence between moist and dry conditions. 

A horizon
Hue: 2.5Y through 7.5YR
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 1 to 3 dry or moist
Reaction: pH 6.1 to 7.3

C horizon
Hue: 2.5Y through 7.5YR
Reaction: pH 6.1 to 7.3 

COMPETING SERIES: None listed.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - mountain side slopes, hills and ridges
Elevation - 1,925 to 2,625
Slope - 6 to 60 percent
Parent material - soil formed in thin noncalcareous very gravelly coarse-textured materials weathered from granite bedrock
Mean annual air temperature - 5 to 8 degrees C
Mean annual summer air temperature - 13 to 15 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation - 460 to 610 mm
Precipitation pattern - peak periods of precipitation occur during the spring and summer months
Frost-free period - 80 to 120 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:Somewhat excessively drained; rapid runoff; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:These soils are used for native pastureland, for limited forestry purposes, and for recreation. Native vegetation consists of spruce and fir at higher elevations and ponderosa pine, Gambel oak, mountain mahogany, and grasses at lower elevations.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:Juget soils are extensive in the foothills along the eastern front of the Rocky Mountains and in other mountainous areas of central Colorado; MLRA 48A and 49.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE:Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:Boulder County Area, Colorado, 1971.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - 0 to 15 cm (A horizon)
Lithic contact - 28 cm to hard granite bedrock (R horizon)
Particle-size control section - 0 to 28 cm (A and C horizons)

Juget soils have a frigid soil temperature regime and an ustic soil moisture regime.
