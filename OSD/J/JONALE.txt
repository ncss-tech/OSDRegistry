JONALE SERIES

The Jonale series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvial material derived from conglomerate.  Jonale soils are on hills and have slopes of 0 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jonale sandy clay loam-rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

     A1--0 to 5 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine interstitial pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick).

     A2--5 to 10 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 6 inches thick).

     Bk1--10 to 16 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable,  slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine interstitial pores; 10 percent pebbles; strongly effervescent; few fine calcium carbonate accumulations, moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 20 inches thick).

     Bk2--16 to 66 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine interstitial pores; strongly effervescent; few fine calcium carbonate accumulations; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Grant County, New Mexico; NE 1/4, NW 1/4, SE 1/4 of sec.  11, T. 18 S., R. 15 W., about 8 miles west of Silver City.; 108 degrees, 21 minutes, 38 seconds w. longitude; 32 degrees, 45 minutes, 20 seconds n. latitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture:  The SMCS is usually moist, in all parts, for less than 90 cumulative days from April through October.  It is usually dry, in some part, for more than 120 cumulative days during the same period.  It is continuously moist in some part November through April, but not moist in all parts for 45 consecutive days from January through April.  The period of maximum precipitation is July through October.  The soil is driest during May and June.  Aridic ustic moisture regime.

Soil Temperature:  50 to 57 degrees F.

Depth to calcic horizon:  7 to 20 inches

A horizon:  Hue - 7.5YR or 10YR.
Value:  3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.

Bk horizon:  Hue - 7.5YR or 10YR.
Value:  4 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4.
Texture:  sandy clay loam, clay loam or loam (18 to 35 percent clay).  Rock fragments:  0 to 35 percent pebbles.
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  15 to 40 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Dioxice (NM), Escabosa (NM), Hovenweep (UT), Section (AZ) and Suglo (WY) soils.  Dioxice soils are more than 20 inches to the calcic horizon.  Escabosa and Hovenweep soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  Section and Suglo soils have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR.  In addition, Section soils are moist for longer periods of time due to higher rainfall and elevation component.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jonale soils are at elevations of 4,800 to 6,500 feet on hills with soils of 0 to 35 percent.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 48 to 55 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches and occurs mainly as thunderstorms in July, August, and September.  The frost-free period is 150 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Guy, Lonti, Ruidoso, and Manzano soils.  Guy soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Lonti, Ruidoso, and Manzano soils lack calcic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for rangeland.  Present vegetation is blue grama, black grama, sideoats grama, bluestem, threeawn, juniper, and sacahuista.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwest New Mexico.  The series is inextensive.  MLRA 38.
