JACKSBORO SERIES


The Jacksboro series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in residuum derived from sandstone conglomerates over indurated bedrock. These very gently sloping soils occur on ridges of hills. Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, mixed, active, thermic Lithic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Jacksboro fine sandy loam--in rangeland. (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise stated.)

 A--0 to 10cm (0 to 4 in); brown (10YR 4/3) fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure, hard, friable; many fine and medium roots; 5 percent by volume siliceous gravel less than 25mm (1 in) in diameter; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. Thickness is 8 to 15 cm (3 to 6 in).

 E--10 to 28cm (4 to 11 in); light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very gravelly fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; hard, friable; many fine and medium roots; 35 percent by volume siliceous gravel less than 51mm (2 in) in diameter; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. Thickness is 0 to 25cm (0 to 10 in).

 Bt--28 to 46cm (11 to 18 in); red (10R 4/6) very gravelly clay, red (10R 4/6) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm; few fine roots; continuous thin clay films on faces of peds; 40 percent by volume siliceous gravel less than 51mm (2 in) in diameter; few siliceous cobbles; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. Thickness is 15 to 38cm (6 to 15in).

 R--46 to 64cm (18 to 25in); indurated conglomerate sandstone bedrock.

R Horizon:
Bedrock kind: conglomerate sandstone bedrock consisting of siliceous gravel, cobbles, and sand cemented with silica or indurated sandstone. These materials are interbedded with thin layers of shale or clay. The indurated layer is several feet thick and has fractures several feet apart through the layer.
Cementation: strongly cemented or indurated

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in the same family. Similar soils are the Kopperl, Lometa, Lusk, and Nocken series.
Kopperl soils: have solum thickness of more than 102 cm (40 in)
Lometa, Lusk and Nocken soils: have solum thickness of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 in)

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: Residuum derived from interbedded conglomerate/ sandstone with thin layers of shale/clay
Landscape: hills
Landform: ridges
Slope: 1 to 3 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 762 to 864 mm (30 to 34 in)
Thornthwaite annual P-E index: 40 to 50
Mean annual air temperature: 17.8 to 18.3 degrees C (64 to 65 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 220 to 240 days
Elevation: 259.1 to 457.2 m (850 to 1,500 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bonti, Darnell, Exray, Shatruce and Shavash soils. All of these soils contain less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control sections. 
Bonti soils: these soils are 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 in) deep over sandstone and occur on similar positions but slightly lower in elevation.
Darnell soils: these soils have loamy particle-size control sections and occur on lower positions on steeper slopes.
Exray soils: these soils occur on similar positions but slightly lower in elevation.
Shatruce soils: these soils are 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 in) deep over soft shale bedrock and occur on lower positions on steeper slopes.
Shavash soils: these soils have loamy particle-size control sections and occur on similar positions but slightly lower in elevation.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Runoff is medium. Permeability is moderately slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for rangeland. Some areas are mined for gravel. Present vegetation is mainly little bluestem, sideoats grama, threeawn, ragweed, with scattered blackjack and post oak trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: LRR H; MLRA 80B - Texas North Central Prairies. The series is of small extent.
