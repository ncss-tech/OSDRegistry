JACANYON SERIES

The Jacanyon series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium over residuum from sedimentary rocks.  These soils are on backslopes and shoulders of foothills, hills and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 10 to 50 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Jacanyon loam, in rangeland on a 25 percent slope at an elevation of 6,500 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.) 

    A--0 to 2 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine, common medium, and few coarse roots; few fine irregular pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 4 inches thick)

    Bt1--2 to 11 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common medium and few fine roots; common fine and very fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.

    Bt2--11 to 18 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) gravelly clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; common fine and very fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.

    Bt3--18 to 26 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 15 percent gravel and 5 channers; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (combined thickness of Bt horizons is 18 to 27 inches)

    BC1--26 to 30 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) channery clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few fine irregular pores; 20 percent channers; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.

    BC2--30 to 35 inches; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) very channery clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 35 percent channers; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (combined thickness of BC horizons is 6 to 9 inches)

    R--35 inches; sandstone.
