JOWEC SERIES

The Jowec series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Jowec soils are on low lake terraces and have slopes of 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Xeric Paleargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jowec silty clay loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

   A--0 to 5 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak thick platy structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; very few roots; many fine and medium vesicular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.5); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 5 cm thick)

   Bt1--5 to 23 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) clay, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and common fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on the ped faces and lining pores; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 20 mm thick)

   Bt2--23 to 51 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; common fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on ped faces and lining pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (13 to 40 cm thick)

   C--51 to 97 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (13 to 50 cm thick)

   2Ab--97 to 137 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; massive; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; l5 percent strongly cemented durinodes; very few roots; very few pores; slightly effervescent with carbonate in seams; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 50 cm thick)

  2C--137 to 150 cm light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; very few roots; very few pores; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 25 cm thick)

   3Ab--150 to 175 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine angular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 25 cm thick) 

   3C--175 to 183 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy sand, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  Washoe County, Nevada; in Cold Springs Valley north of Reno; 800 feet east and 800 feet north of the southwest corner of section 9, T. 2l N., R. l8 E.; USGS Reno NW 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; 39 degrees 41 minutes 45 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 58 minutes 31 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.6958333 latitude, -119.9752778 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Soil moisture: Usually dry but is moist in winter and spring; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Depth to C horizon: 38 to 64 cm.
Mean annual soil temperature: 10 to 12 degrees C.  

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 35 to 50 percent

A horizon 
Value: 6 or 7 dry. 
Chroma: 2 or 3. 

Bt horizons
Value: 5 or 6.
Chroma: 2 through 4.  
Texture: Dominantly clay but the range includes clay loam and silty clay.  

C horizons
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 through 4.  
Texture: Loamy sand through silt loam and is stratified with buried A horizons in some pedons.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Berdugo, Bowns, Brent, Chardoton, Hagata, Locey, Lodico, Poall, Reba and Spangenburg series.
Berdugo soils have a weakly cemented horizon. Bowns, Hagata, Locey, Lodico soils are moderately deep. Chardoton soils have more than 15 percent clay in the C horizon. Poall soils have slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline A horizons. Reba soils have secondary carbonates. Spangenburg soils have neutral A horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jowec soils are on low lake terraces and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  They formed from alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Elevations are 1,465 to 1,710 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm.  Mean annual temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C.  Frost-free season is about l00 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Doten and Greenbrae soils.  Greenbrae soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Doten has wide cracks open to the surface upon drying.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow to ponded runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for range, recreation, and urban development.  Native vegetation is scattered big sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, cheatgrass, and wild onions.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Intermountain valleys of southern Washoe County, Nevada.  The soils are of small extent. MLRA 26.
