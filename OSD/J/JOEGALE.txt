JOEGALE SERIES

The Joegale series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum weathered from calcareous sandstone and limestone. These soils are on shoulders and summits of hillslopes. Slopes are 4 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and annual air temperature is about 3.9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Joegale loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 6 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), moist; weak fine granular structure; very friable, soft, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many fine and common medium roots; many very fine dendritic tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 7 cm thick) 

    Btk1--6 to 24 cm; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4), moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; common fine and many medium roots; few fine dendritic tubular pores; 6 percent faint clay films on all faces of peds; 1 percent fine irregular carbonate nodules in matrix; 5 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (12 to 36 cm thick)

    Btk2--24 to 45 cm; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; firm, moderately hard, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few fine roots; few fine dendritic tubular pores; 6 percent faint clay films on all faces of peds; 5 percent fine irregular carbonate nodules in matrix; 5 percentgravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 23 cm thick)

    R--45; calcareous sandstone bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained, Ksat in particle-size control section 1.5-15.0 um/sec.

USE AND VEGETATION: Joegale soils are primarily used for rangeland. The potential native vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, Sandberg bluegrass, Indian ricegrass, and other forbs and grasses.   

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Joegale soils are of small extent in southwestern Wyoming. MLRA 46.

SERIES PROPOSED: Lincoln County, Wyoming, 2015. The series name is derived from a local landmark.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - 0 to 6 cm (A horizon)
Argillic horizon- 6 to 45 cm (Btk1, Btk2 horizons)
Calcic horizon - 24 to 45 cm (Btk2 horizon) 
Lithic contact - at 45 cm (R horizon)
