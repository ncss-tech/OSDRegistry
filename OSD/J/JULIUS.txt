JULIUS SERIES 

The Julius series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium or residuum derived from semiconsolidated tuff.  These soils are on alluvial fans stream terraces and sedimentary plains.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, frigid Alfic Argiustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Julius loam, in hayland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Ap1--0 to 4 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic, many fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick) 

    Ap2--4 to 8 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; many very fine pores; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 6 inches thick) 

    Bt/E--8 to 11 inches; Bt part (65 percent) is brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay loam, dark brown (10YR 4/4) moist; E part (35 percent) is pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many medium and  fine roots; common fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick.) 

    Bt1--11 to 17 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay, dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; strong medium columnar structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine and medium roots; few very fine tubular pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary  (2 to 7 inches thick). 

    Bt2--17 to 23 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and medium and many very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (2 to 9 inches thick) 

    Bk--23 to 33 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; common fine tubular pores; disseminated lime, common fine masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (7 to 10 inches thick)
