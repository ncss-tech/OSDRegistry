JUGHANDLE SERIES

The Jughandle series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum from granitic rock. Jughandle soils are on mountains and have slopes of 7 to 90 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 34 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, isotic Vitrandic Haplocryepts 

TYPICAL PEDON: Jughandle ashy loam, woodland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 3 inches; undecomposed litter.

    Oe--3 to 4 inches; partially decomposed litter.

    Bs--4 to 15 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) ashy loam; dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and common very fine, medium, and coarse roots; about 35 percent volcanic ash with small pockets of nearly pure pyroclastic material; moderately acid; abrupt wavy boundary. (7 to 13 inches thick)

    2Bw--15 to 31 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common fine irregular pores; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary.

    2BC--31 to 45 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) and pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. (combined thickness of the 2C horizon is 20 to 50 inches)

    2Cr--45 to 51 inches; decomposing gneiss.

TYPE LOCATION: Idaho County, Idaho; about 2/3 mile northeast of Elk City about 400 feet south and 400 feet east of the center of section 23, T. 29 N., R. 8 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Average annual soil temperature - 38 to 44 degrees F.
Average summer soil temperature with an O horizon - 44 to 47 degrees F.
Depth to paralithic contact - 40 to 60 inches
Volcanic ash thickness - 7 to 13 inches
Volcanic glass content in the 0.02 to 2.0 mm fraction - 5 to 40 percent Acid-oxalate extractable Al plus 1/2 Fe - 0.40 to 2.0
Moist bulk density - 0.90 to 1.20 gm/cc.

Bs horizons
Hue - 7.5YR or 10YR
Value - 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma - 3 or 4 dry or moist
Base saturation - 30 to 50 percent
Reaction - strongly or moderately acid

Bw and BC horizons
Hue - 7.5YR or 10YR
Value - 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist
Chroma - 2 through 4 dry or moist
Clayey bands - wavy, horizontal 3 to 5 mm. thick (do not have thickness or clay increase to meet argillic criteria)
Base saturation within 30 inches of the surface - 60 to 80 percent

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Daras series. Daras soils are very deep and have an ustic moisture regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Jughandle soils are on mountainous slopes, usually with a northerly aspect, and have gradients of 7 to 90 percent. They formed in residuum from granite, quartz monzonite, gneiss or similar coarse-grained acid igneous bedrock. Elevations are 3,000 to 7,000 feet. Average annual precipitation is 25 to 45 inches. Average annual temperature is 36 degrees to 42 degrees F. Frost- free season is 10 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ericson, Helmer, Lochsa, Molly, and Suttler soils. Ericson soils have a Bt horizon. Helmer soil have a medium textured Bs horizon and a fragipan. Lochsa soils lack cryic summer soil temperature and have a thick umbric epipedon. Molly soils have a high content of volcanic ash and loess in the upper part. Suttler soils have an umbric epipedon and lack a Bs horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; rapid and very rapid runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for woodland, recreation, watershed, and wildlife. Vegetation is mainly subalpine fir, Douglas-fir, grand fire, lodgepole pine, spruce, beargrass, twin flower, and huckleberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North-central Idaho. The series is moderately extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Idaho County, Idaho, Western Part, 1976.

REMARKS: This revision changes the classification from Coarse-loamy, mixed Vitrandic Cryochrepts to Coarse-loamy, isotic Vitrandic Eutrocryepts.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from 4 to 15 inches (Bs horizon).
Cambic horizon - the zone from 15 to 45 inches (2Bw and 2BC horizons).
Paralithic contact - at 45 inches.

The 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Coarse-loamy, isotic Vitrandic Eutrocryepts to Coarse-loamy, isotic Vitrandic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.
