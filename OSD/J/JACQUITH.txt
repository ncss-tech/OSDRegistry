JACQUITH SERIES



The Jacquith series consists of moderately deep to a duripan soils on

fan terraces.  They formed in mixed alluvium and eolian deposits.

Permeability is rapid.  Slopes are 0 to 12 percent.  The average annual

precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual air temperature

is about 49 degrees F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Xereptic Haplodurids



TYPICAL PEDON:  Jacquith loamy fine sand - grass; on a 1 percent slope

at 2,685 feet elevation.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise

noted.)



    A--0 to 3 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loamy fine sand, very

dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak very fine granular structure;

loose, very friable; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine

interstitial pores; mildly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.

(0 to 5 inches thick)



    C1--3 to 19 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loamy fine sand, dark grayish

brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; soft,

very friable; common fine roots; few very fine tubular pores;

moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 25 inches

thick)



    C2--19 to 27 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loamy fine

sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard,

friable; few fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly

effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to

15 inches thick)



    2Bkb--27 to 36 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) light fine sandy loam

containing very few fine gravel, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist;

massive; matrix slightly hard, very friable; few very fine roots;

common very fine and fine tubular pores; about 5 percent consists of

hard rounded nodules of soil material or (cicada) krotovinas; violently

effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0

to 12 inches thick)



    2Bkqmb--36 to 50 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) weakly cemented

duripan, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; platy, the upper plate

0.3 to 0.8 inch thick and barely can be broken in 2 hands (cannot be

broken in places) but cannot be broken in one hand; top plate has a 1mm

thick, pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) discontinuous indurated laminar crust

at its top that is smooth but wavy or irregular; laminar crust cannot

be scratched with a dime and barely can be scratched with a knife;

lower side of plate is rough but lacks distinct stalactites; the

material below the upper plate is white (10YR 8/2), very weak medium

platy, barely can be broken in 2 hands, has many very fine and fine

pores; strongly alkaline (pH 8.7); clear irregular boundary.  (6 to 25

inches thick)



    2C--50 to 60 inches; stratified sandy loam, loamy sand, and

gravelly loamy sand.  Continues to be an undetermined depth.



TYPE LOCATION:  Canyon County, Idaho; about 3.5 miles east of Homedale;

220 feet north and 80 feet west of the southeast corner of section 5,

T. 3 N., R. 4 W.



RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:



Average annual soil temperature - 47 to 54 degrees F

Depth to duripan - 20 to 40 inches

Depth to calcium carbonate - 15 to 30 inches

Texture in control section - LFS, LS, LCOS, FSL



A horizon

Value - 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist

Chroma - 2 or 3

Reaction - neutral to moderately alkaline



2Bk horizon

Calcium carbonate content - 15 to 25 percent

Durinode content - 0 to 20 percent

Reaction - mildly to strongly alkaline



2Bkq horizon

Duripan - series of thick plates with SL to LS in between, a thin

laminar cap remains brittle and will not slake in HCL

Reaction - mildly to strongly alkaline



COMPETING SERIES:  This is the similar Truesdale series.  Truesdale

soils are moderately coarse textured between a depth of 10 inches and

the duripan.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jacquith soils are on level to sloping, slightly

dissected, medium and high terraces.  Slope gradients are from 0 to 12

percent but dominantly between 2 and 5 percent.  Elevations range from

2,200 to 3,500 feet.  The soils formed in eolian or alluvial deposits

of mixed mineralogy.  The climate is semiarid and has dry summers and

moist winters.  Average annual precipitation is 7.5 to 11 inches,

including 8 to 30 inches of snow.  Average annual air temperature is 45

to 52 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 120 to 160 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Quincy soils which lack

a duripan and the Minidoka soils which have a coarse-silty control

section.  These soils are on landscape positions similar to the

Jacquith soil.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well-drained, slow runoff; rapid

permeability.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mostly for rangeland.  Natural vegetation is

big sagebrush, Indian ricegrass, and forbs.  Some areas are irrigated

and crops include small grains, alfalfa, hay, pasture, and few

orchards.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Idaho.  This series is moderately

extensive.
