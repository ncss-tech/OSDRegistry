COMPETING SERIES: This is the McNair soil. The McNair soils formed in ash over colluvium and residuum, and are underlain by a paralithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Juniperlake soils are on ground moraines in the Southern Cascade mountains. Slopes are 2 to 40 percent. These soils formed in tephra and till from andesite and basalt. Elevation is 5442 to 8190 feet (1659 to 2497 m). Mean annual precipitation is 39 to 109 inches, (991 to 2769 mm). The mean annual temperature is 38.5 to 43 degrees F, (3.6 to 6 degrees C). Frost free season is 60 to 85 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Scoured soil.  The Scoured soils are moderately deep to bedrock and are on adjacent scoured ridges and glacial headlands.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; saturated hydraulic conductivity is high to very high in the A horizons, high in the AB and Bw horizons, and moderately low in the Cdq horizon. 

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for wildlife habitat, recreation, ecosystem management and watershed. Vegetation is California red fir, western white pine, lupine, and penstemon.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The soils are inextensive and are mapped in MLRA: 22B Southern Cascade Mountains
