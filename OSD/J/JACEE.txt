JACEE SERIES

The Jacee series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from interbedded shale and sandstones on bedrock controlled plains, mesa tops, and small alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 10 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Calcidic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jacee loam -- rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

     A--0 to 2 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium platy structure parting to moderate fine granules; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and common very fine roots; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 7 inches thick)

     Bt1--2 to 4 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common fine and very fine roots, common thin clay films on faces of peds and in pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 12 inches thick)

     Bt2--4 to 12 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) heavy silty clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; strong coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine and common very fine roots; common thin clay films on faces of peds and in pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 14 inches thick)

     Btk--12 to 16 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) heavy silty clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine and common very fine roots; few thin clay films on faces of peds and in pores; strongly effervescent, 20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 14 inches thick)

     Bk--16 to 24 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 7/4) clay, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few very fine roots; strongly effervescent, 23 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).  (3 to 12 inches thick)

     Cr--24 to 30 inches; soft yellow shale and sandstone with rock structure but easily cut with a spade, over firm to hard shale or sandstone (Mancos formation).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ramah (NM) and Teczuni (NM) series. Potential competitors that have not yet been reclassified are the Montecito (NM), Paguate (NM), and Teco (NM) series. Montecito, Ramah, Teco and Teczuni soils are very deep. Paguate soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact of basalt. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jacee soils are nearly level to moderately sloping bedrock controlled plains, mesa tops, and small alluvial fans.  Elevation ranges from 6,300 to 7,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 to 15 inches, the mean annual temperature is about 47 to 54 degrees F., and the frost-free season is about 115 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Celacy, Goesling, Hickman and Catman soils.  Celacy soils are in a fine-loamy particle size class.  Goesling, Hickman and Catman soils are deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, medium runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Jacee soils are used for grazing.  Present vegetation is mainly blue grama, galleta, and fourwing saltbush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Catron County, New Mexico.  This series is of moderate extent. MLRA 35.
