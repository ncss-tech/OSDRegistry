JAMESCANNY SERIES

The Jamescanny series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Jamescanny soils are on alluvial fans.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Pachic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Jamescanny loam--pastureland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 A1--0 to 20 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; few fine tubular and many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.1); abrupt smooth boundary. (10 to 25 cm thick)

 A2--20 to 79 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.3); gradual smooth boundary. (25 to 60 cm thick)

 C1--79 to 104 cm; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; few fine tubular and many very fine tubular pores; 5 percent medium and coarse distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), moist, masses of oxidized iron; 30 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual smooth boundary. (20 to 60 cm thick)

 C2--104 to 152 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 50 percent medium and coarse prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), moist, masses of oxidized iron; 25 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Douglas County, Nevada; about 1.6 kilometers northeast of the town of Genoa; about 1,520 feet north and 2,070 feet east of the southwest corner of section 3, T. 13 N., R. 19 E; USGS Genoa 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 0 minutes 57.58 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 50 minutes 12.46 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.0159944 latitude, -119.8367944 longitude.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Alicel, Calimus, Chalkford, Linville, Sinamox, Sweeney and Watama series. 

Alicel, Chalkford, Linville and Sweeney soils have Bw horizons and a xeric moisture regime.  In addition, Chalkford soils have more than 27 percent clay in their particle-size control section, Linville soils have basalt bedrock within 100 to greater than 150 cm and Sweeney soils have a lithic contact within 91 to 150 cm.  Calimus soils have Bw horizons and have less than 15 percent rock fragments in their particle-size control section.  Sinamox soils have paralithic material within 100 to more than 150 cm and have a Bw horizon.  Watama soils have a lithic contact within 50 to 100 cm, have Bw horizons and have a Xeric moisture regime.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Jamescanny soils are on alluvial fans. They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,400 to 1,555 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 350 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dresslewet, Kimmerling and Kimvar series.  Dresslewet soils have less than 18 percent clay in their particle-size control section and have a mollic epipedon less than 50 cm thick.  Kimmerling and Kimvar soils have an aquic moisture regime.  In addition, Kimmerling soils have 25 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent rock fragments in their particle-size control section, and Kimvar soils have a histic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; medium surface runoff; moderate permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  A seasonal high water table is present between 122 and 152 cm (Deep free water occurrence class).  Cumulative annual duration class common or persistent (December through June).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Jamescanny soils are used for pasture land, watershed and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly legume-grass pasture.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Nevada and Eastern California, east of the Sierra Nevada Range. These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 26.
