JOES SERIES

The Joes series consists of very deep, well drained soils on fan terraces, hills and basalt plains.  They formed in loess and silty alluvium derived from loess.  Slopes are 1 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Calcixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Joes silt loam - on an east-facing slope of 9 percent in a field of nonirrigated small grain at 5,000 feet elevation.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described the soil was moist throughout.)

    Ap--0 to 6 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak coarse granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (6 to 9 inches thick)

    AB--6 to 13 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 11 inches thick)

    Bk1--13 to 21 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common fine and very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual smooth boundary.  (5 to 16 inches thick)

    Bk2--21 to 36 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many fine and very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 19 inches thick)

    C1--36 to 43 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many fine and very fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 18 inches thick)

    C2--43 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many fine and very fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7)

TYPE LOCATION:  Bannock County, Idaho; about 3.5 miles northwest of Robin; 2,315 feet north and 85 feet east of the southwest corner, sec.  21, T. 9 S., R. 36 E.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Church Springs and Gobine series.  Church Springs soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Gobine soils are 21 to 29 inches to the calcic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Joes soils are on fan terraces and basalt plains.  Slopes are 1 to 20 percent.  Elevation is 4,500 to 6,600 feet.  The soils formed in loess and silty alluvium derived from loess.  The climate is semiarid with dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arbone, Camelback, Hades, Hondoho and Rexburg soils.  The Arbone soils are coarse loamy.  The Camelback and Hondoho soils are loamy-skeletal.  The Hades soil is fine loamy and has an argillic horizon.  The Rexburg soil is coarse silty.  The Arbone and Hondoho soils are on slopes along drainageways and on terrace breaks.  The Camelback and Hades soils are on upper fan terraces.  The Rexburg soils are on nearby landscapes at slightly higher elevations in the same position as Joes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to very rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for nonirrigated small grain.  A few areas are used for rangeland.  Potential natural vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho.  This series is inextensive.
