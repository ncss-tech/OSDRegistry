JEMCO SERIES

The Jemco series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits over residuum derived from sandstone.  Jemco soils are on mesas and hills.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jemco silt loam , on a northeast facing, simple, 3 percent slope in ponderosa pine woodland at an elevation of 8290 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  Described on July 31, 1980.

     Bt2--22 to 35 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, very sticky and moderately plastic; few distinct clay films on faces of peds; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual wavy boundary.

(combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 14 to 34 inches)

     2R--39 inches; hard fractured sandstone bedrock, weathered in upper inch.

COMPETING SERIES:  Current competitors are the:  Alderon, Allens Park, Bayerton, Belltower, Elbeth, Elbuck, Elmark, Hoyt, Kunz, Lumpgulch,  Northrim, Plome, Rule, Shoemaker, Sweetweed, and Tunitcha series.  Other soils that may be competitors when their classification is updated are the: Eaglecreek, and Jemez series.


Alderon and Elmark and Lumpgulch: formed in parent material weathered from granite.

Allens Park and Rule:  have a precipitation pattern with most of the precipitation falling in the spring and summer.

Bayerton:  have horizons of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation.

Belltower:  has a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches

Eaglecreek:  have 5 to 25 percent igneous rock fragments in the particle size control section and formed from igneous parent material

Elbeth, Elbuck, Hoyt, Kunz, Northrim, Plome, and Sweetweed:  do not have a lithic contact above 40 inches

Jemez:  formed in parent materials derived from tuff and are more alkaline

Shoemaker:  have redox concentrations in the lower part of the argillic horizon

Tunitcha:  have a paralithic contact with sandstone at 40 to 60 inches

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  eolian deposits over residuum derived from sandstone.
Landform:  mesas and hills.
Slopes:  1 to 15 percent
Elevation: 7,800 to 8,500 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  40 to 46 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  18 to 22 inches.
  Wettest months:  July and August receive slightly more precipitation than other months.
  Driest months:  May and June receive the least precipitation, however the soils are moist through mid June from snowmelt.
Frost-free period:  70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Beje, Burnson, and Detra series.  All are on mesas and hillslopes.

Beje soils are shallow.
Burnson soils are deep and have fine textured argillic horizons.
Detra soils are deep and have thick mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, low runoff, moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major uses are commercial woodland, wildlife habitat, and livestock grazing.  The native vegetation consists of ponderosa pine with an understory of Gambel's oak, snowberry, Arizona fescue, mountain brome, western wheatgrass, and Columbia needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwest Colorado.  LRR E, MLRA 48A.  This series is of moderate extent.
