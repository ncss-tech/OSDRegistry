JADPOR SERIES

The Jadpor series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium from extrusive igneous rock.  Jadpor soils are on alluvial terraces.  Slopes ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Pachic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jadpor very gravelly sandy loam on a west facing 2 percent slope under a cover of grasses, forbs, ponderosa pine, Oregon white oak, Western juniper and shrubs at an elevation of 2800 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless, otherwise stated.  When described June 27, 1989, the soil was dry throughout).

    C2--45 to 61 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely cobbly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grained; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 35 percent rounded gravel, 35 percent rounded cobbles and 15 percent rounded stones all coated with silica; neutral (pH 7.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Shasta County, California; about 10 miles NE of Burney, 1 mile East of the Hwy - 299 Pit River Bridge.  S on a dirt road then 0.3 miles SW, 50 feet south of dirt road 1500 feet South and 500 feet East from the Northwest corner of section 16, T.4E, R.36N Burney NE (Cassel) Quadrangle (7.5 minute series).

RANGE CHARACTERISTIC:  Thickness of the A and Bt horizons is 25 to 50 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. from early March to late Dec (300 days) and exceeds 47 degrees F. from mid April to mid November (125 days).  The soil moisture control section (21 to 60 inches) is dry in all parts from early July to early November (115 to 125 days) and is moist in all parts from mid November to mid May.  The particle-size control section (12 to 32 inches) ranges from 15 to 32 percent clay and 35 to 80 percent rock fragments, mostly gravel and cobbles.  Rock fragments, mostly gravel, on the soil surface, range from 10 to 60 percent.  Mineralogy is mixed.  Organic matter ranges from 1 to 5 percent to a depth of 20 to 25 inches and decreases regularly with depth.

The A horizon color is 10YR 5/2, 5/1, 4/2, or 4/1.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/1, 2/2, or 2/1.  Texture is very gravelly sandy loam, extremely gravelly sandy loam or extremely cobbly sandy loam.  Clay content ranges from 12 to 16 percent.  Rock fragments, mostly gravel or cobbles range from 35 to 80 percent.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.

The Bt horizon color is 7.5YR 5/4, 6/4; 10YR 5/3, or 6/3.  Moist color is 7.5YR 4/4, 10YR 3/3, or 4/3.  Texture is extremely cobbly sandy loam or extremely cobbly sandy clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 20 to 32 percent.  Rock fragment, mostly gravel or cobbles range from 60 to 80 percent and commonly have silica coatings.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.

The C horizon color is 7.5YR 5/4; or 10YR 6/3.  Moist color is 7.5YR 4/4; or 10YR 4/3.  Texture is extremely cobbly or stony coarse sandy loam.  Clay content ranges from 5 to 20 percent.  Rock fragments range from 60 to 90 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Blinst (T WA), Carrcreek (T CA), Copperfield (OR), Dillcourt (T WA), Hyrum (UT), Kettenbach (T ID), Lainand (T WA), McDaniel (WA), Norod (T WA), Ricketts (T CA), and Sagley (OR) series.  Blint, Kettenbach, Norod, and Ricketts soils are 20 to 40 inches deep over a lithic contact. Carrcreek soils have a combined A and Bt thickness of over 60 inches, a mean annual soil temperature of 52 to 59 degrees F, and are dry for 75 to 100 days.  Copperfield, Dillcourt, Hyrum, and McDaniel soils are dry for 90 days or less.  Lainand soils have a combined A and Bt thickness of 40 to 60 inches over hard basalt and are dry for less than 90 days. Pait soils have a sandy C horizon beginning at a depth of 24 to 40 inches.  Sagley soils ?????

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jadpor soils are on alluvial terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium weathered from extrusive igneous rock.  Elevation is 2700 to 3200 feet.  The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 16 to 30 inches.  Snowfall is 30 to 50 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F.  The mean January temperature is about 31 degrees F.  The mean July temperature is about 66 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 50 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Britton, Dotta and Keddie soils.  Britton soils are on hills, are shallow and have clayey particle size class.  Dotta soils are on fans and terraces and have a fine-loamy particle size control section.  Keddie soils are on flood plains and fans, have fine-loamy particle size control sections and are poorly drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  This soil is mainly used for timber production, livestock grazing and wildlife.  Small areas are used as urban development.  The natural vegetation is ponderosa pine, Oregon white oak, western juniper, California black oak, grasses and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern California.  The soils are not extensive.  MLRA is 22.
