JAEGIE SERIES

The Jaegie series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from gniess, schist, sedimentary and igneous rock.  These soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Eutric Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Jaegie gravelly coarse sandy loam, forested (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; forest litter of slightly decomposed needles, twigs, and leaves. 

    A--2 to 4 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft,very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and common medium roots; many very fine and common fine pores; 20 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 3 inches thick) 

   E--4 to 15 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; many very fine and common fine pores; 10 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 14 inches thick).

   E/Bt--15 to 25 inches; E part (60 percent) is yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; Bt part (40 percent) is yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; many very fine and common fine pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds and pebble surfaces; 15 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 14 inches thick)

   Bt--25 to 43 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly sandy clay loam; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; many very fine and common fine pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and pebble surfaces; 20 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (14 to 30 inches thick)

   C--43 to 60 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly coarse sandy loam; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine and common medium pores; 20 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0).
