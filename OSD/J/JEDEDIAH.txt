JEDEDIAH SERIES

The Jedediah series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess over rhyolite.  Jedediah soils are on hills and have slopes of 0 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3.3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive Pachic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jedediah silt loam on a hill with 7 percent slope at an elevation of 1981 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 Ap1--0 to 11 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam; very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; moderately acid (pH 5.6); abrupt smooth boundary.

 Ap2--11 to 35 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist,  moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular and many very fine irregular pores; common strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist, iron-manganese masses; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Ap horizons is 28 to 50 cm)

 AB--35 to 47 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam; dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, very friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic; few very fine roots; common very fine and few medium tubular pores; common strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist, iron-manganese masses; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (12 to 25 cm thick)

 EB--47 to 69 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam; brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic; common very fine roots; common very fine irregular and common very fine tubular pores; few (20 percent) faint skeletans on faces of peds; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 31 cm thick)

 Bt1--69 to 107 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silty clay loam; strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium subangular blocky; very hard, friable, very sticky, very plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine and common fine tubular pores; few (10 percent) organoargillans on surfaces along pores, many (50 percent) skeletans on surfaces along pores, common (30 percent) clay films on surfaces along pores and few (10 percent) black (7.5YR 2.5/1) moist, organic stains on surfaces along pores; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary.

 Bt2--107 to 125 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silty clay loam; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/6) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium subangular blocky; very hard, friable, very sticky, moderately plastic; few very fine roots; common fine tubular and many very fine tubular pores; common (40 percent) skeletans on surfaces along pores, few (10 percent) clay films on surfaces along pores and few (5 percent) black (7.5YR 2.5/1) moist, organic stains on surfaces along pores; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt1 and Bt2 horizons is 33 to 56 cm thick)

 Bt3--125 to 152 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silty clay loam; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/6) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very friable, very sticky, moderately plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine and common fine tubular pores; few (20 percent) skeletans on surfaces along pores and few (20 percent) clay films on surfaces along pores; neutral (pH 7.2).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bozeman, Greybo, Lanark, Pinebutte, Robana, and Bustle (T) series.  Bozeman soils have calcareous materials beginning at a depth of 38 to 100 cm.  Greybo soils have an argillic horizon comprised of lamellae.  Lanark soils have a calcic horizon.  Robana soils have an ustic soil moisture regime.  Pinebutte soils are deep to bedrock.  Bustle soils have 21 to 27 percent clay in the particle size control section, lack EB or BE horizons and formed in loess over alluvium.
