JOEBALDY SERIES

The Joebaldy series consists of soils that are moderately deep to fragmental material.  They are well drained soils on high elevation mountain ridges.  They formed in material weathered from talus and colluvium from metasedimentary rock with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  Permeability is moderate in the solum and very rapid in the substratum.  Slope ranges from 10 to 50 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 50 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Medial-skeletal over fragmental or cindery, glassy over mixed Typic Fulvicryands

TYPICAL PEDON:  Joebaldy stony medial silt loam, alpine grassland;    on a south facing convex slope of 35 percent at 5400 feet elevation.  When described on September 8, 1981, the soil was dry throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated).

    Oe--0 to 0.5 inch; slightly decomposed needles, leaves, and twigs mixed with Mt. St. Helens volcanic ash.

    A1--0.5 to 3 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) stony medial silt loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak very fine and fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, and few medium roots; many very fine and fine tubular and irregular pores; 15 percent pebbles and 10 percent cobbles; about 0.1 percent of the surface is covered with stones; strongly acid (pH 5.5); clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)

    A2--3 to 10 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) stony medial silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak very fine and fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine and fine tubular and irregular pores; 15 percent pebbles, 5 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones; strongly acid (pH 5.5); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 12 inches thick)

    Bw1--10 to 17 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very stony medial silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine, and few medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular and irregular pores; 15 percent pebbles, 10 percent cobbles, and 15 percent stones; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 12 inches thick)

    Bw2--17 to 28 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very stony medial silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular and irregular pores; 20 percent pebbles, 15 percent cobbles, and 20 percent stones; moderately acid (pH 6.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (7 to 12 inches thick)

    2C--28 to 60 inches; 25 percent pebbles, 35 percent cobbles, and 40 percent stones with no fines in voids.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Joebaldy soils are on high elevation mountain ridges.  Slopes range from 10 to 50 percent.  These soils formed in material weathered from talus and colluvium from metasedimentary rock, with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  Elevations range from 5200 to 6300 feet.   The average annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F, average annual precipitation is 45 to 55 inches, and frost-free season is from 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Buckhouse, Latour (T), and Vay soils. Buckhouse soils are ashy over loamy-skeletal and are on high elevation mountain slopes. Latour soils lack a fragmental horizon within the control section and are on high elevation mountain slopes.  Vay soils are ashy over loamy-skeletal and are on high elevation mountain slopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability in the solum and very rapid in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed.  Potential natural vegetation is mainly common beargrass, big blueberry, common yarrow, Columbia brome, green fescue, sedges, and Sitka mountainash, with a few scattered whitebark pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Idaho.  This soil is not extensive.
