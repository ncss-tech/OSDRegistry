8/2016--In Willamette National Forest, layers with andic soil properties are assumed to meet criteria 2 (no ash required) in the 12th edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy. It is also assumed that enough ash is present for those layers to meet criteria 3. Additional lab data is needed to confirm the degree of ash influence.
