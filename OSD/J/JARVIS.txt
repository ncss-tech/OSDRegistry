TYPE LOCATION:  Salcha-Big Delta Area, Alaska; about 3 miles north of Harding Lake in the SE 1/4 of the NW 1/4, Section 19, T.5S., R.5E., Fairbanks Meridian.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Mean annual soil temperature: about 33 degrees F., 0.5 C.
Thickness of organic mat: 0 to 7 inches, 0 to 18 cm
Depth to sand and gravel: 10 to 40 inches, 25 to 101 cm
Organic carbon content: decreases irregularly with depth
Upper part of control section: 
Weighted average: greater than 15 percent fine sand or coarser; less than 18 percent clay
Mica content: significant amount of mica but less than 25 percent by weight
Lower part of control section:
Texture: sand or loamy sand with less than 50 percent very fine sand

O horizon:
Texture: slightly or moderately decomposed plant material
Reaction: strongly acid to slightly acid

A horizon: (where present)
Matrix color: hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 3 to 5; chroma of 2 to 4
Texture: stratified very fine sandy loam, silt loam, and fine sandy loam
Reaction class: Strongly acid to slightly acid.

The A/C horizon:
Matrix color; hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y; value of 3 to 5; chroma of 2 or 3
Texture: stratified very fine sandy loam, silt loam, and very fine sand
Reaction class: Strongly acid to slightly acid

C horizons:
Matrix color: hue of 10YR to 5Y; value of 2 to 6; chroma of 1 to 4
Texture: stratified with textures including very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, sand, fine sand, and very fine sand
Reaction class: strongly acid to neutral

2C horizon
Matrix color: hue of 10YR to 5Y; value of 4 or 5; chroma of 1 to 4
Texture: sand or loamy sand modified by 35 to 70 percent total rock fragments, 25 to 60 percent gravel, 10 to 30 percent cobble.
Reaction class: strongly acid to neutral

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Klute, Klutina, Niklason, Portdick, and Tonowek soils in the same family.  All of these soils lack substantial amounts of mica within the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: silty and sandy stratified alluvium overlying sand and gravel with high mica content
Landform: floodplains and terraces
Slope: 0 to 7 percent.
Climate: subarctic continental with long, cold winters and short, warm summers.
Mean annual temperature: 25 to 28 degrees F., -3.8 to 2.2 C.
Mean annual precipitation: 10 to 15 inches, 254 to 381 mm

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Chena, Goldstream, and Tanana soils. Chena soils are shallower to the underlying skeletal material and are on higher terrace positions. The Goldstream and Tanana soils contain permafrost and are on higher terrace positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Runoff is slow. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the upper horizons and high to very high in the underlying material.  Occasional flooding may occur.

USE AND VEGETATION: Jarvis soils have a native vegetation of white spruce, paper birch, quaking aspen, and cottonwood.  A few areas have been cleared and are used for grasses, small grains, and vegetable crops.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 229, Interior Alaska Lowlands. The series is of moderate extent.
