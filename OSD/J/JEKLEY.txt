JEKLEY SERIES

The Jekley series are moderately deep to deep, reddish, well drained, and moderately fine textured. They are noncalcareous and neutral to slightly alkaline. They developed in residuum weathered from sandstone and shale. They occur on north-facing slopes on very strongly sloping to very steep side slopes 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jekley silty clay loam - wildlife habitat, timber production (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated)

	Oe--0 inch to 1; undecomposed and partly decomposed organic litter; abrupt boundary

	A1--1 to 6 inches; dusky red 2.5YR 3/2) silty clay loam, dusky red (2.5YR 3/2) when moist; strong, fine, granular structure; soft when dry, very friable when moist; noncalcareous; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear boundary.

	A2--6 to 12 inches; dusky red (2.5YR 3/2) silty clay loam, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/3) when moist; moderate fine, subangular blocky structure; hard when dry, very friable when moist; noncalcareous; neutral (pH 7.0); clear boundary.

	Bt1--12 to 22 inches; dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/3) silty clay loam, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 2/3) when moist; moderate fine, subangular blocky structure; very hard when dry, friable when moist; noncalcareous; neutral (pH 6.8); thin patchy clay films; few sandstone fragments; clear boundary.

	Bt2--22 to 38 inches; weak red (10R 5/3) silty clay, weak red (10R 4/3) when moist; moderate, medium subangular blocky structure; very hard when dry, friable when moist, noncalcareous; neutral (pH 6.8); thin, continuous clay films; few sandstone fragments; gradual wavy boundary.

	Bt3--38 to 47 inches; weak red (10R 5/3) silty clay, weak red (10R 4/3) when moist; weak, medium subangular blocky structure; very hard when dry, friable when moist; noncalcareous; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); thin, patchy clay films; some slickensides; few sandstone fragments; gradual wavy boundary.

	R--47 to 61 inches; partly weathered shale similar in color to the Bt3 horizon

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture: The SMCS is usually moist, in some part, for more than 90 cumulative days from May through October. It is usually dry, in all parts, for less than 90 cumulative days during the same period. It is continuously moist in some part November through 
April. The soil is driest during May and June. Typic ustic moisture regime.

Soil Temperature - 42 to 47 degrees F.

Mollic epipedon - 10 to 20 inches

Depth to argillic horizon - 10 to 20 inches

Depth to bedrock- 40 to 60 inches 


Particle size control section

A horizon 
Hue: 2.5YR to 7.5YR  
Value: 3 to 5 dry, 2 to 4 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4 
Other features: horizon thickness ranges from 5 to 13 inches.

Hue: 10R to 5YR
Value: 3 to 5 dry, 2 to 4 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4 
Texture: sandy clay loam to silty clay or clay. 
Other features: thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 60 inches. 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bigpaw (AZ) and Owlspring (NM) series. The Bigpaw and Owlspring soils are very deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: Residuum from shale
Landform: canyon side slopes
Slope: 20 to 40 percent
Mean annual temperature: 36 to 45 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 18 to 22 inches
Frost free period 85 to 105 days
Elevation: 7,200 to 8,000 feet

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The Fuera and the Supervisor soils which develop in material weathered from schist, quartzite and igneous rock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, slowly permeable, Runoff is rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION: Wildlife habitat and production of timber which support a mixed stand of Ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, white fir and an understory of mulberry, yucca and cool season grasses. The understory provides some grazing for livestock.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: This soil is located in the western part of Torrance Area. MLRA 39.
