JUMPSTART SERIES

 The Jumpstart series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on foothills and mountains. These soils formed in local alluvium , colluvium or residuum derived from shale. Slopes are 30 to 50 percent. Jumpstart soils have slow permeability. Mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:
There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - foothills and mountains.
Elevation - 5600 to 8000 feet.
Slope - 30 to 50 percent.
Parent material - local alluvium, colluvium or residuum derived from shale.
Climate - Precipitation is evenly distributed throughout the year. A winter snowpack of 3 to 7 feet in depth and lasting through May is common. 
Mean annual temperature - 35 to 39 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation - 24 to 30 inches.
Frost free period - 30 to 50 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Nearl and Sedgway series. Nearl soils are in nearby basins. They are 12 to 30 inches deep to layers that have cracks, slickensides and redox accumulations and depletions. Sedgway soils are on nearby summits and sideslopes. They average less than 35 percent clay and greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle- size control section. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained, slow to medium runoff, slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Jumpstart soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing, recreation and wildlife habitat. The potential natural vegetation is the subalpine fir/western meadowrue plant association. The subalpine fir/western meadowrue p.a. and subalpine fir/Columbian brome community are commonly supported.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Idaho. They are of moderate extent.
