JACKALOPE SERIES

The Jackalope series consists of deep, well drained soils on mountain backslopes.  Jackalope soils are formed in volcanic ash overlying colluvium from andesite.  Slopes are 5 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy over loamy-skeletal, glassy over isotic, frigid Alfic Udivitrands

TYPICAL PEDON: Jackalope ashy sandy loam - woodland, on a 32 percent north-facing slope at elevation of 4,500 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted. Soil textures are apparent field textures.)
