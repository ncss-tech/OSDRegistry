JENSEN SERIES

The Jensen series consists of very deep, well drained soils that are formed in silty alluvium and lacustrine sediments influenced by alluvium.  They are on lake terraces, fan terraces, and in drainageways.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Pachic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jensen silt loam, nonirrigated cropland; on a 5 percent slope at 5080 feet elevation.  When described on November 13, 1986, the soil was moist throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Ap--0 to 6 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine tubular pores; many very  fine and fine roots; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    A--6 to 12 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine tubular pores; many very fine and fine roots; 10 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 12 inches thick)

    Bt1--12 to 22 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine tubular pores; common very fine and fine roots; 20 percent gravel; few faint clay films in pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 15 inches thick)

    Bt2--22 to 38 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, very firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine tubular pores; common very fine and few fine roots; 20 percent gravel; few faint clay films in pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (14 to 20 inches thick)

    Bk1--38 to 45 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist;  moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine tubular pores; few very fine roots; 30 percent gravel and 1 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; many lime veins; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 12 inches thick)

    Bk2--45 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine tubular pores; few very fine roots; 35 percent gravel and 1 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; many lime veins; mildly alkaline (pH 7.8).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Clegg, Despain, Gross, and Lize series.   Clegg soils have less than 5  percent coarse fragments throughout the profile.  Despain soils have argillic horizons less than 20 inches thick.  Gross soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Lize soils have 25 to 35 percent clay in the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jensen soils are on level to gently sloping lake terraces, fan terraces, and in drainageways.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,900 to 5,900 feet.  The soil formed in silty alluvium and lacustrine sediments influenced by alluvium.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 18 inches, and the average annual air temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Bancroft, Elevator (T), Manila, Hondoho, and Buckboard (T) soils.  Bancroft, Elevator, Manila, and Hondoho soils have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick.  Buckboard soils have lime deeper than 40 inches.  Bancroft, Manila, and Hondoho soils are on mountain sides.  Buckboard soils are on lower level lake terraces.  Elevator soils are on lake terraces and playas.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Jensen soils are used for nonirrigated cropland.  The vegetation is small grains and alfalfa.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho.  The soils of this series are not extensive.
