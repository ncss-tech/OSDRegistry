JENKSDRAW SERIES

The Jenksdraw series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in local alluvium or residuum from limestone and calcareous sandstone.  Jenksdraw soils are on shoulders and backslopes of ridges and hillslopes in mountains.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 760 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive Calcic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jenksdraw silt loam, on a southwest-facing convex slope of 4 percent, in grassland, at an elevation of about 2,010 meters.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on July 20, 2000, the soil was dry throughout.

    A--0 to 5 cm; black (10YR 2/1) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and common fine roots throughout; common very fine tubular pores; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 13 cm thick) 

    AE--5 to 18 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots throughout; common very fine tubular pores; 25 percent distinct skeletans on all faces of peds; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. (12 to 25 cm thick) 

    Bt/E--18 to 38 cm; 50 percent reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) (Bt part) and 50 percent dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) (E part) silty clay loam, light reddish brown (2.5YR 6/4) and brown (10YR 5/3) dry; weak fine prismatic structure parting to strong fine and medium subangular blocky; very hard, friable, moderately sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine roots throughout; common very fine tubular pores; 50 percent distinct skeletans on all faces of peds and 60 percent faint reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) argillans on all faces of peds; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (5 to 25 cm thick)

    Bt--38 to 58 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/4) silty clay, brown (7.5YR 5/4) dry; weak fine prismatic structure parting to strong medium subangular blocky; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine roots throughout; common very fine tubular pores; 60 percent faint brown (7.5YR 4/4) argillans on all faces of peds; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. (12 to 50 cm thick) 

    2Btk--58 to 89 cm; reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) gravelly clay, light reddish brown (2.5YR 6/4) dry; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots throughout; 20 percent faint reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) argillans on all faces of peds; common medium and coarse prominent white (7.5YR 8/1) irregular carbonate masses with clear boundaries;  10 percent subangular gravels and 10 percent subrounded cobbles; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary. (12 to 50 cm thick) 

    2R--89 to 200 cm; gray (2.5Y 5/1) to pale red (10R 7/3), light gray (2.5Y 7/1) to pink (10R 8/3),dry cherty limestone.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Gillam (T) series.  Gillam soils are deep or very deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  local alluvium and/or residuum derived from sedimentary rock
Landform:  shoulders and backslopes of ridges and hillslopes in mountains; typically on convex or linear surfaces
Slopes:  2 to 15 percent
Elevation:  1,890 to 2,135 meters
Mean annual air temperature:  2 to 6 degrees C 
Mean annual precipitation:  660 to 865 millimeters
Precipitation pattern:  In most years, half or more of the normal precipitation falls as rain and/or snow from March through mid-July.
Frost-free period:  less than 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Gillum (T), Redbird, and Rockerville (T) soils.
Gillum(T)and Redbird are deep and very deep; they occur on linear and slightly concave surfaces below Jenksdraw soils.
Rockerville - is shallow to a lithic contact; generally they occur on convex surfaces above Jenksdraw soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity; medium to high runoff. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Jenksdraw soils appear to have formed under a rotating forest/grassland complex.  They are utilized for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The modern perennial plant community includes Timothy, common yarrow, false sunflower, prairie smoke, prairie junegrass, Kentucky bluegrass, bearded wheatgrass, and shrubby cinquefoil. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Jenksdraw soils occur in the High Limestone Plateau physiographic area of MLRA 62 (the Black Hills) of South Dakota and Wyoming; LRR G; the series is of small extent.
