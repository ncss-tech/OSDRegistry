JAPANY SERIES

The Japany series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in clayey sediment. Permeability is very slow. These nearly level to steep soils are in interfluves of the Cretaceous Western Gulf Coastal Plain. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, thermic Aquic Dystruderts

TYPICAL PEDON: Japany silty clay loam--pasture. 

	A--0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 in); brown (10YR 4/3) silty clay loam; few fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) mottles weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; few medium iron manganese masses; firm; many fine and medium and common coarse roots; neutral; clear smooth boundary. 

	Bt1--15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 in); variegated yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) and light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silty clay loam; common fine distinct light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) iron depletions; moderate medium subangular blocky structure;fine few iron manganese masses; firm; common fine and medium and few coarse roots; common fine faint discontinuous distinct clay films on faces of peds; about 2 percent by volume sandstone and chert fragments less than 3 inches in diameter; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary. 

	Btss1--30 to 56 cm (12 to 22 in); variegated yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) and light brownish gray(10YR 6/2) silty clay; few fine prominent red (2.5YR 4/6) iron accumulations; moderate medium and coarse angular blocky structure; firm; few fine, medium, and coarse roots; many fine distinct continous clay films on faces of peds; about 1 percent by volume sandstone and chert fragments less than 8 cm (3 in) in diameter; few discontinous distinct nonintersecting slickensides on vertical faces of peds; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. 

	Btss2--56 to 94 cm (22 to 37 in); variegated gray (10YR 6/1) and strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) silty clay; common fine prominent red (2.5YR 4/8) iron accumulations; strong coarse angular blocky structure; very firm; few medium iron manganese masses; few fine and medium roots; many fine distinct continous clay films on faces of peds; about 2 percent by volume sandstone and chert fragments less than 8 cm (3 in) in diamete in diameter; few disonctious distinct nonintersecting slickensides on vertical faces of peds; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.

	Btss3--94 to 140 cm (37 to 55 in); variegated light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) clay; common fine distinct gray (10YR 6/1) iron depletions on surfaces along root channels; strong coarse angular blocky structure; very firm; common medium iron manganese concretions; few fine and medium roots; many fine distinct continous clay films on faces of peds; about 2 percent by volume sandstone and chert fragments less than 8 cm (3 in) in diamete in diameter; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

	Bt2--140 to 203 cm (55 to 80 in); gray (2.5Y 5/1) silty clay, many medium prominent strong brown(7.5YR 5/8) iron accumulations; common medium iron manganese masses; strong coarse angular blocky structure; very firm; many distinct continous clay films; 20 percent sandstone and chert fragments less than 8 cm (3 in) in diamete in diameter; 5 percent limestone fragments less than 30 cm (12 in); moderately alkaline. 

TYPE LOCATION: Pike County, Arkansas; T8S, R25W, Sec 1, SE1/4 NE1/4 NW1/4 SW1/4; DELIGHT USGS topographic quadrangle, Latitude: 34 degrees,  4 minutes, 51.50 seconds N., Longitude: 93 degrees, 37 minutes, 26.60 seconds W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Solum thicknes: 30 to more than 60 inches
The acid Bt horizon is irregularly underlain by marl and partially weathered chalk at a depth that varies from 30 to 80 inches or more.
Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to alkaline. 

A horizon
Hue: 10YR
Value: 3 to 5
Chroma: 2 or 3
Redoximorphic features: Iron manganese masses and iron accumulations range from none to common
Fine-earth: very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam. 

Btss horizon(s)
Hue: 2.5Y, 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 4 to 8
Redoximorphic features: none to many that have chroma of 2 or less, or it is variegated in shades of yellow, brown, gray, and red
In some pedons the lower part of the Bt horizon
Hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y
Value of 5 to 7
Chroma of 1 or 2, with redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, and gray and most common on surfaces of peds or slickensides.
Fine-earth: silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay. Iron manganese masses range from none to many.
Rock fragments: 0 to 5 percent, predominantly sandstone gravel.

Bt horizon(s)
Variegated in shades of yellow,red, brown, and gray, 
OR
Hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y
Value of 5 or 6
Chroma of 3 to 6
Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, gray and yellow
OR
Dominant matrix color of gray with brown iron accumulations.
Fine-earth: silty clay loam, silty clay, clay loam, or clay.
Roc fragments: sandstone is less than 15 percent, predominantly gravel size. Some horizons have limestone flagstones. 

BC and C horizons, where present
Same range in characteristics as the Bt horizon but may be characterized by calcium carbonate masses and concretions and by chalk fragments. 

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Ichusa and the Ichusa series. 
The Ichusa and Louin are in a smectitic mineralogy class.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Japany soils are nearly level to steep.
These soils formed in clayey sediments in uplands of the Cretaceous Western Gulf Coastal Plain. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The climate is warm and humid. Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is inches. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing, Billstown, Tiak, Antoine, and Delight.
Billstown is located on similar landscapes but has a particle size class of very fine.
Tiak is fine and moderately well drained.
Antoine has a particle size class of fine silty.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; slow runoff;
and permeability is very slow. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used for pasture and hay. Smaller acreages are in mixed hardwoods, shortleaf pine, and loblolly pine. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Cretaceous Western Gulf Coastal Plain of Arkansas and possibly Oklahoma.
