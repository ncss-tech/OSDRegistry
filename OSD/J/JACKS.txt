JACKS SERIES

The Jacks series consists of deep, well drained soils on uplands. Slopes are 0 to 45 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Jacks fine sandy loam - forested. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)
 Oi--0 to 1 inch; fresh pine needles.
 Oe--1 to 3 inches; partially decomposed pine needles and oak leaves.
 A--3 to 6 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) light fine sandy loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few fine roots; many very fine irregular pores, common fine tubular pores; about 5 percent gravel and cobblestones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick)
 Bt1--6 to 10 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) sandy clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky, plastic; few fine and medium roots; many very fine irregular pores, common very fine and fine tubular pores; few thin clay films on ped faces and as bridges; about 10 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 6 inches thick)
 Bt2--10 to 30 inches; yellowish red (5YR 4/6) clay, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; weak medium prismatic structure breaking to strong medium angular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, sticky, very plastic; few fine, medium and coarse roots; common very fine irregular pores, and very fine tubular pores; many moderately thick clay films on ped faces and in pores; about 5 percent gravel and 10 percent stones; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clay wavy boundary. (7 to 20 inches thick)
 Bt3--30 to 45 inches; yellowish red (5YR 4/6) stony clay, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; weak medium and fine angular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, sticky, very plastic; few fine, medium and coarse roots; common very fine irregular pores, and very fine tubular pores; 15 percent stones; many moderately thick clay films on ped faces; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (7 to 18 inches thick)
 R--45 to 47 inches; yellowish red (5YR 4/6) and red (2.5YR 5/6) massive calcareous sandstone bedrock, extremely hard.

TYPE LOCATION: Coconino County, Arizona; SW 1/4 Sec. 32, T. 15 N., R. 12 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Depth to sandstone bedrock: usually between 24 and 42 inches, and ranges from 20 to 50 inches
Mean annual soil temperature: 47 to 59 degrees F.
Reaction: neutral to moderately alkaline in the B horizon
Soil moisture: These soils are not continuously dry in all parts for as long as 60 consecutive days. Typic ustic moisture regime.

A horizon
Hue: 5YR through 10YR
Value:  3 to 6 dry and 3 to 5 moist
Chroma:  1 to 6, dry or moist
Texture: sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, clay loam
Rock fragments: none to 50 percent stones and gravel on the surface
Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline. 

Bt horizon
Hue: 5YR or 2.5YR (Hue of 5YR is dominant and the 2.5YR hue appears to be related to reddish colors in the sandstone).
Value:  3 to 5 dry and 3 to 6 moist
Chroma:  1 to 6, dry or moist
Texture: sandy clay, clay and heavy clay loam
Clay content: more than 35 percent clay
Rock fragments: a few to 20 percent cobblestones and 5 to 10 percent gravel. Structure: blocky or prismatic structure of moderate to strong grade
Reaction: neutral to moderately alkaline
Effervescence: A few pedons have spots that effervesce with hydrochloric acid in the lower part of the B2 horizon.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Amos (AZ), Arriba (NM), Lama (NM) and Lemmon (AZ) series. Amos soils are deep to a paralithic contact of sandstone. Arriba soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact of shale. Lama soils are very deep. Lemmon soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact of mica-schist.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Jacks soils are on uplands. Elevations are mostly 5,600 to 6,900 feet, and they range from 6,200 to  8,000 feet. Slopes are dominantly 0 to 15 percent and range from 0 to 45 percent. The average annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 22 inches. The mean annual air temperatures range from  45degrees to 58 degrees F. The freeze-free season ranges from 110 to 170 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: In addition to the competing Disterheff, Dye and Hogg soils, these are the Lynx, Showlow, Springerville, and Tortugas soils. The Lynx soils have mollic epipedons and are along drainageways within areas of Jacks soils. The Showlow soils have mollic epipedons and ca horizons at moderate depths. Springerville soils lack argillic horizons and crack deeply upon drying. Tortugas soils are shallow to bedrock and contain more than 50 percent coarse fragments.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Runoff is medium. Permeability is slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for forest, water and wildlife production and for range. Native vegetation is ponderosa pine, pinon pine, manzanita, alligator juniper, Gambel oak, cliffrose, June grass, mountain muhly, blue grama, sideoats grama, squirreltail, and pine dropseed.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central and northern Arizona and possibly New Mexico. The series is extensive. MLRAs 35 & 39.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Beaver Creek Area, Arizona, 1965.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from 3 to 6 inches (A horizon)
Argillic horizon - The zone from 6 to 45 inches (Bt horizons)
Lithic contact - boundary at 45 inches (R horizon)
Classified according to Soil Taxonomy, 2nd Edition, 1999. Keys to Soil Taxonomy Tenth Edition, 2010
Classification changed from Udic subgroup to Typic subgroup in 2006. This change was made to be consistent with the soil moisture regime.
