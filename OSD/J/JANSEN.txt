JANSEN SERIES

The Jansen series consists of very deep, well drained moderately permeable soils formed in loamy sediments over alluvial sand and gravel.  These upland soils have slopes ranging from 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jansen loam - on a 0.6 percent convex south-facing slope in a cultivated field.  When described the soil was moist throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated)

    Ap--0 to 6 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak medium and fine granular; slightly hard, very friable; strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 7 inches thick)

    A--6 to 12 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak coarse blocky structure parting to weak fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

    BA--12 to 15 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate coarse blocky structure parting to moderate medium and fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 5 inches thick)

    Bt1--15 to 18 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, firm; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 5 inches thick)

    Bt2--18 to 25 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate, medium and fine subangular blocky; hard, firm; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 18 inches thick)

    2BC--25 to 30 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loamy coarse sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure breaking to single grained; soft, very friable; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (3 to 5 inches thick)

    2C--30 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) gravelly coarse sand and gravel, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; single grained; loose; slightly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Holt County, Nebraska; about 4 miles north of the east edge of Oneill; 2,000 feet south and 100 feet west of the northeast corner, sec. 6, T. 29 N., R. 11 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil Moisture: The soil moisture control section is moist in some part from October through April; intermittently moist from May through July; driest in July through September
Depth to carbonates: 20 to 40 inches
Thickness of the mollic epipedon: 7 to 20 inches
Thickness of the solum: 20 to 40 inches
Depth to coarse sand and gravel: 20 to 40 inches
Comment: Gravel is on the surface and mixed throughout the profile of some pedons

A horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: loam, but the range includes silt loam to loamy sand
Reaction: strongly acid to neutral

Bt horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR
Value: 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam
Clay content: 18 and 32 percent
Reaction: strongly acid to neutral
Structure: weak to moderate prismatic and subangular blocky that parts to fine or medium subangular blocky
Clay films:  faint continuous on faces of some peds

2C horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: stratified sand, gravelly coarse sand, and coarse sand
Rock fragments: 2 to 75mm rounded gravel from 2 to 40 percent by volume
Reaction: strongly acid to neutral

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Canning series.  Canning soils have carbonates within a depth of 20 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jansen soils are nearly level to sloping uplands.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 30 percent and range from short and irregular to medium length and smooth.  The soils formed in loamy alluvium or loess over alluvial sand and gravel.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from about 18 to 25 inches, and mean annual air temperatures range from 45 to 54 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Anselmo, Brocksburg, Meadin, Oneill and Reliance soils.  Anselmo soils have more sand in the control section and occur below Jansen soils.  Brocksburg soils have mollic epipedons greater than 20 inches thick and occur on similar landscapes.  Meadin soils contain more than 35 percent gravel in the control section, and are less than 20 inches to gravel.  They occur on steeper slopes.  Oneill soils have more sand in the control section and occur on similar landscapes.  Reliance soils have more clay in the control section, lack sand and gravel, and occur on nearly level slopes below Jansen soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is low and medium.  Permeability is moderate through the solum and rapid to very rapid through the substrata.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Cropped to milo, wheat and alfalfa.  Some areas are irrigated.  Native vegetation is short, mid and tall grasses, and includes big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, sideoats grama, western wheatgrass, blue grama and sand dropseed.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central to south-central Nebraska, mainly along the upper Elkhorn, Republican, and Little Blue Rivers, and central Kansas and south-central South Dakota.  The series is of moderate extent.
