JUDSON SERIES

The Judson series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in silty colluvium derived from non-calcareous loess. These soils are on foot slopes, upland drainageways, and alluvial fans. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 810 millimeters.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Blue Earth County, Minnesota, 1906.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters (A1, A2, AB, Bt, and BC horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (Ap, A1, A2, AB, Bt, BC, and C horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 89 centimeters (Ap, A1, A2, AB, and Bt horizons); 
cambic horizon-the zone from a depth of 89 to 132 centimeters (BC horizon);
udic moisture regime.

The Bt horizon does not have the 1.2 percent clay increase to meet the requirements of an argillic horizon.

Cation-exchange class is supported by lab sample number S96IA-193-005, NSSL.

Taxonomy version--tenth edition, 2006.

A cherty silt loam phase is mapped in MLRA 105, this soil is considered a fine-loamy taxadjunct of the Judson series.
