JAMCANVAR SERIES

The Jamcanvar series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed alluvium derived from mixed rocks and hot spring deposits. The Jamcanvar soils are on stream terraces. Slopes are 2 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Jamcanvar, loam--hayland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 A--23 to 38 cm; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) sandy clay loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; common faint very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist and few medium distinct dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist iron redox concentrations; weak fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few fine and medium wormholes; common fine tubular pores; micaceous; neutral pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary.

TYPE LOCATION: Douglas County, Nevada; about 500 meters south and 200 meters east of the northwest corner of section 14, T. 14 N., R. 19 E. USGS Genoa 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 4 minutes 49 seconds N and longitude, 119 degrees 49 minutes 23 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.0802778 latitude, -119.8230556 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry in the moisture control section; moist winter and spring, usually dry summer and fall; aridic soil moisture regime that borders on xeric.  Saturated within 50 to 75 cm during the late winter and early spring in most years.
Mean annual soil temperature: 9 to 11 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 38 to 50 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 18 to 25 percent.
Rock fragments: Less than 15 percent when averaged.  Lithology of rock fragments is mainly igneous rock.

A horizons
Value: 3 or 4 dry.
Chroma: 1 or 2.
Reaction: Neutral through moderately alkaline.
Organic matter content: 2 to 4 percent.
Redox concentrations: Common faint iron redox concentrations are in the lower part of the A horizon in some pedons.

Bk horizons
Value: 5 through 8 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3.
Texture: Sandy loam, loam or sandy clay loam.
Clay content: Averages 18 to 25 percent.
Rock fragment content: Less than 15 percent.
Consistence: Soft to slightly hard, very friable to friable, slightly sticky to sticky and slightly plastic to plastic.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 20 to 40 percent.  
Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

Cg horizons
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma: 3 or 4.
Texture: Stratified loamy sand or loamy coarse sand.
Redox concentrations: Few to many distinct to prominent iron redox concentrations.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Lunsford series.  Lunsford soils have a Bt horizon and a Bq horizon and lack a calcic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Jamcanvar soils are on stream terraces. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks and hot spring deposits. Slopes are 2 to 4 percent. Elevations are 1,435 to 1,550 meters. The climate is cool, semiarid with warm summers and moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; Mean annual temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C., and frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Holbrook, Jamescanny and Ophir soils. These soils all lack calcic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat Poorly drained, medium runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 50 and 75 cm (moderately deep free water occurrence class) between December and June. Cumulative annual duration class is common.

USE AND VEGETATION: Hayland, cropland and wildlife habitat. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Valleys of western Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 26.
