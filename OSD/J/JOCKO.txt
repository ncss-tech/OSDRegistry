JOCKO SERIES

The Jocko series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in glacial outwash and alluvium.  These soils are on stream terraces and dissected alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Calcic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jocko gravelly loam, in cropland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 6 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 15 percent pebbles and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.

    A--6 to 13 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots, common fine tubular pores; 15 percent pebbles and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of A horizons is 8 to 14 inches.)

    Bw1--13 to 19 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 30 percent pebbles and 15 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.

    Bw2--19 to 25 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; 40 percent pebbles and 15 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of Bw horizons is 6 to 14 inches.)

    Bk--25 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely gravelly coarse sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; 50 percent pebbles and 20 percent cobbles; few faint soft lime coatings on undersides of pebbles, and few prominent hard lime casts on undersides of pebbles; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lake County, Montana, 1991; proposed in Lake County, Montana, 1970.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT0421.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 19 inches (Ap, A, Bw1 horizons); a cambic horizon from 19 to 25 inches (Bw2 horizon); a calcareous horizon from 25 to 60 inches (Bk horizon).  Jocko soils have a frigid temperature regime and a xeric moisture regime.
