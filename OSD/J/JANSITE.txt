JANSITE SERIES

The Jansite series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Jansite soils occur on stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Natrixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jansite silt loam on a north facing slope of 1 percent in native rangeland. When described on August 30, 1988, the soil was dry to 10 inches and moist below that depth. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

   An1--0 to 2 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine and medium platy ; hard,very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine and fine interstitial and few very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent (about 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); electrical conductivity is 16 mmhos/cm; very strongly alkaline (pH 10.5); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 2 inches thick)

   An2--2 to 10 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium platy structure parting to weak fine and medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few fine interstitial, and few very fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent (about 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); electrical conductivity is 38 mmhos/cm; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.9); abrupt smooth boundary. (6 to 11 inches thick)

   Btn1--10 to 23 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; strong fine, medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few faint clay films on faces of peds and in pores; few very fine roots; common very fine and few fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent (about 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); electrical conductivity is 13 mmhos/cm; very strongly alkaline (pH 10.6); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 13 inches thick)

   Btn2--23 to 41 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; strong fine, medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few faint clay films on faces of peds and in pores; few very fine roots; common very fine and few fine tubular pores; slight effervescence (about 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); electrical conductivity is 11 mmhos/cm; very strongly alkaline (pH 10.0); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 18 inches thick)

   Bn1--41 to 45 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt  loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable,  slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and many very fine tubular pores; slight effervescence (about 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); areas of stratified sand and silt; electrical conductivity is 6 mmohs/cm; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.3); gradual smooth boundary. (4 to 20 inches thick)

   Bn2--45 to 57 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; lenses of stratified sand and silt; moderate coarse and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine tubular pores; slight effervescence (about 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); electrical conductivity is 6 mmohs/cm; very strongly alkaline  (pH 9.0); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 12 inches thick)

   Bn3--57 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist, lenses of stratified sand and silt ; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine tubular and common very fine interstitial pores; slight effervescence (about 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); electrical conductivity is 6 mmohs/cm; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other soils recognized in this family.  Soils in a closely related family are the Quinney and Polson series. The Quinney soils are coarse silty.  Polson soils have a frigid temperature regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jansite soils are on stream terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 3,000 to 3,400 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 9 to 11 inches.  The average annual temperature is 48 to 51 degrees F. and the frost free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Springcove (T), Quencheroo (T), Loupence (T), Power and Purdam soils.  Springcove does not have a mollic epipedon and does not contain sand in the pedon.  Quencheroo, Loupence, Power and Purdam do not have natric horizons.  Purdam has a pan above 40 inches.  Quencheroo soils have  rock above 60 inches.  Quencheroo, Loupence and Springcove soils occur on the same landscape.  Purdam and Power soils occur on basalt plains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; runoff very slow; permeability is moderately slow.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Jansite soils are used for irrigated cropland, pastureland and hayland.  The native vegetation includes:  black greasewood, saltgrass, fourwing saltbush, and basin wildrye.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Jansite soils are of small extent in south central Idaho.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Gooding County, Idaho, 1993.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to 23 inches (An and Btn horizons)

Natric horizon - the zone from 10 to 41 inches (Btn1 and Btn2 horizons)

Xeric moisture regime - these soils receive additional moisture from run-on because of their position on the landscape.
