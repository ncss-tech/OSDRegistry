Gallipolis soils formed mainly in acid silty old alluvium. Percell and Stonehead soils have less than 10 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Tarhollow soils formed in 61 to 102 cm (24 to 40 inches) of loess over residuum from siltstone or shale. Westgate soils have a subhorizon with hue redder than 7.5YR within the argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Jeneva soils are on till plains of Illinoian age. Slope ranges from 2 to 6 percent. The soils formed in loess, a thin layer of pedisediment, and a paleosol formed in till. Climate is humid and temperate. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1143 mm (36 to 45 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (51 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free period is 139 to 174 days. Elevation is 290 to 305 meters (950 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alford, Cincinnati, Hickory, and Wellston soils. The well drained Alford soils are on nearby topographic positions. The moderately well drained Cincinnati soils are on similar landscape positions and have a fragipan. The well drained Hickory soils are on more sloping positions and have fine-loamy argillic horizons. The well drained Wellston soils have bedrock residuum within 102 cm (40 inches) and are on similar landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 61 to 107 cm (2.0 to 3.5 feet) between January and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION: Jeneva soils are cultivated. Principal crops are corn, soybeans, wheat, and legume-grass mixtures. Native vegetation is deciduous forest mostly of maple, tulip poplar, oak, and hickory.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Ohio; MLRA 114A. The series is of small extent.
