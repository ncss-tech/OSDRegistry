JACKMORE SERIES

The Jackmore series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in loess over glacial moraine deposits derived from metamorphic rock.  Jackmore soils are on high elevation mountain side slopes.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 600 cm, and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, nonacid Typic Cryorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jackmore very cobbly fine sandy loam, wildlife habitat and forestland.   (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is partially covered with 10 percent gravel. 

    Oa--0 to 2 cm; slightly decomposed pine needles, grass and twigs; abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 10 cm thick)

    A--2 to 8 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly very fine sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and many fine roots; few very fine, fine and medium interstitial pores; 35 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 10 cm thick)

    C1--8 to 64 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly very fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 35 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 75 cm thick)

    C2--64 to 120 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely gravelly fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; few very fine interstitial pores; 45 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); 

TYPE LOCATION:  Elko County, Nevada; Ruby Mountains up Long Canyon about 1110 feet down slope of the Ruby Crest Trail, on the west side; about 1,267 feet west and 1,632 feet south of the northeast corner of section 9., T. 30 N., R. 58 E.; USGS Franklin Lake NW 7.5 minute quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees, 29 minutes, 56.35 seconds N and longitude 115 degrees, 26 minutes, 4.86 seconds W; Decimal degrees latitude 40.4989861, longitude -115.4346833; NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture:  Moist in late fall, winter and spring, dry late June through early October; typic xeric soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature:  4 to 7 degrees C.
Mean summer soil temperature:  7 to 9 degrees C.
Reaction:  Slightly acid or neutral. 

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  2 to 10 percent.
Rock fragments:  35 to 60 percent, mainly gravel.

A horizon
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.

C horizons
Value:  5 through 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4.
Clay content: Averages 2 to 10 percent, some pedons contain sub-horizons that range up to 25 percent. 
Texture:  Sandy loam, and very fine sandy loam.
Rock fragments: 30 to 65 percent mainly gravel with cobble concentrations that range from 5 to 25 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bracos and Gralic series.  Bracos soils average greater than 15 percent clay in the particle-size control section, have a lithic contact between 50 and 100 cm, and a reaction of moderately acid or strongly acid. Gralic soils average greater than 15 percent clay in the particle-size control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jackmore soils formed in loess over glacial moraine deposits derived from metamorphic rock. They occur on linear or broadly concave side slopes of upper mountains. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent. Elevations are about 2,670 to 3,350 meters.  Mean annual precipitation is 450 to 700 mm. Snow load persists under many tree stands through June; mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C and the frost-free season is 40 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Lovamp, Lowemar, and Wrenza series. Lovamp soils have a mollic epipedon 18 to 40 cm thick and clay content 10 to 18 percent in the particle-size control section. Lowemar soils have an umbric horizon that is 50 to 100 cm thick, a base saturation of 15 to 45 percent, and a mean annual soil temperature is 4 to 7 degrees. Wrenza soils have a lithic contact at 50 to 100 cm, a base saturation of 10 to 15 percent, and a clay content greater than 18 percent in the particle-size control section.   

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; moderate runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for wildlife habitat, and rangeland.  The present vegetation is mainly whitebark pine, gooseberry, snowberry, and mountain brome. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern Nevada.  The soils are not extensive. MLRA 25.
