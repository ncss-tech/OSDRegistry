JOBSIS SERIES

The Jobsis series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granitic rock.  Jobsis soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Sandy-skeletal, mixed, shallow Typic Cryorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jobsis very gravelly loamy coarse sand--forest land. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is covered with 25 percent gravel, 5 percent stones, and 15 percent boulders.

    A1--0 to 1 inch; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly loamy coarse sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 50 percent gravel and 5 percent boulders; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick)

    A2--1 to 5 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly loamy coarse sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, common fine, common medium, and common coarse roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 50 percent gravel and 5 percent boulders; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick)

    Bw1--5 to 9 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly loamy coarse sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, common fine, common medium, and common coarse roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 55 percent gravel; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. (3 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw2--9 to 12 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly loamy coarse sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, common fine, common medium, common fine, and common coarse roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 50 percent gravel; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. (3 to 7 inches thick)

    Bw3--12 to 17 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly loamy coarse sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; many very fine interstitial and tubular pores; 45 percent gravel; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. (0 to 5 inches thick)

    2C--17 to 20 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly coarse sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive-rock structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and few fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 50 percent gravel; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. (0 to 5 inches thick)

    2Cr--20 to 30 inches; soft weathered granodiorite.

TYPE LOCATION:  Alpine County, California; on the Toiyabe National Forest about 1 mile southeast of Hawkins Peak; approximately 2,200 feet north and 1,825 feet east of the southwest corner of section 11, T. 10 N., R. 19 E.; USGS Markleeville 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; 38 degrees 43 minutes 34.9 seconds north latitude and 119 degrees 51 minutes 42.0 seconds west longitude, NAD27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Usually moist in the moisture control section during late fall, winter, and spring; dry from mid-July to early October for 60 to 80 consecutive days in the four months following the summer solstice; Typic xeric moisture regime.

Mean annual soil temperature - 35 to 40 degrees F.

Mean summer soil temperature - 44 to 47 degrees F.

Ochric epipedon thickness - 3 to 9 inches.

Depth to bedrock - 10 to 20 inches to a paralithic contact.  The paralithic materials below the contact are weathered granitic rock such as granodiorite.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages less than 10 percent; Rock fragments: Averages 35 to 60 percent, mainly fine gravel.  Lithology of fragments are granitic rocks such as granodiorite.


A horizons - Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.
Organic matter content: 1 to 3 percent.
Reaction: Very strongly acid or strongly acid.


Bw and 2C horizons - Chroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist.
Texture: Very gravelly loamy coarse sand or very gravelly coarse sand.
Clay content: 4 to 10 percent.
Rock fragments: 35 to 60 percent, mainly fine (2 to 5 millimeter diameter) gravel.
Reaction: Very strongly acid or strongly acid.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Windyridge series.  Windyridge soils have paralithic contacts at depths of 4 to 10 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jobsis soils are on mountains.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granitic rock.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 9,000 to 12,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 35 to 55 inches, mean annual temperature is 34 to 37 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 25 to 45 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Klauspeak, Shalgran, Sofgran, and Temo soils.  Klauspeak soils are very deep and have umbric epipedons.  Shalgran soils have a frigid temperature regime.  Sofgran soils are very deep.  Temo soils are sandy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; medium or high surface runoff; rapid permeability (high or very high saturated hydraulic conductivity).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Jobsis soils are used for forest land, recreation, watershed, and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is mainly a forest canopy of whitebark pine and scattered mountain hemlock with an understory of Eriogonum ssp., bluegrass, sedge, and various forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern California and western Nevada, on the east side of the Sierra Nevada Range.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 22A.
