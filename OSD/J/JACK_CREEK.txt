JACK CREEK SERIES

The Jack Creek series consists of deep and very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from chert and shale.  The Jack Creek soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes are 50 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 375 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Torriorthentic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jack Creek extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand, rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 38 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand, black (10YR 2/1) moist; single grained; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 75 percent mostly fine gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); gradual smooth boundary.  (25 to 46 cm thick)

    C1--38 to 112 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand, black (10YR 2/1) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 75 percent mostly fine gravel; few thin clay films coating gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); diffuse smooth boundary.  (64 to 76 cm thick)

    C2--112 to 152 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) extremely loamy coarse sand, black (10YR 2/1) moist; single grained, loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 75 percent mostly fine gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5).

TYPE LOCATION:  Elko County, Nevada; about 2,000 feet south and 1,350 feet west of the northeast corner of sec. 20, T. 36 N., R. 5l E.; USGS Rodeo Creek NE 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 59 minutes 50 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 15 minutes 43 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.9972222 latitude, -116.2619444 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Soil moisture: Usually dry moist in winter and early spring; Aridic bordering on xeric soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 6 to 8 degrees C.  
Thickness of mollic epipedon: 25 to 46 cm.  
Depth to bedrock: 122 to deeper than 200 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 5 to 10 percent.
Rock fragments: 65 to 80 percent; mostly angular chert and shale gravel.

A horizon
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist. 
Chroma: l or 2.
Organic matter: 1 to 2 percent.

C horizons
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist. 
Chroma: l or 2, colors are largely due to the color of the gravel and mineral particles
Texture: Loamy coarse sand to loamy fine sand.
Texture modifier: Extremely gravelly.
Organic matter: 0.5 to 1 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Jack Creek soils are on mountain slopes at elevations of 1,770 to 2,130.  The slopes commonly have south exposures but some have east exposures at the lower elevations.  Slopes are 50 to 75 percent.  The soils have formed in residuum and colluvium derived from chert and shale.  The average annual temperature is 5 to 8 degrees C.; mean annual precipitation is 360 to 400 mm; and the frost-free season is about 80 to 95 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Torro soils which have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Excessively drained; medium runoff; rapid permeability; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing and browse for upland game.  The vegetation is principally big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, and cheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Nevada.  These soils are of small extent, about 6,533 acres have been mapped. MLRA 25.
