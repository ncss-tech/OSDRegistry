JUMBOPEAK SERIES


The Jumbopeak series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from granite, gneiss and schist. Jumbopeak soils are on mountains. Slope ranges from 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Golondrina, Irock, Lantis, Majada, Mokiak, Montoso, Murdo, Nederland, Purcella, Romine, Salas, Wandurn, Wheelerwell and Willowman series. Golondrina, Lantis, Majada, Montoso, Murdo, Nederland, Purcella, Romine, and Willowman soils are very deep. Irock soils have C horizons with 5 to 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. Mokiak soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 50 to 54 degrees F and sandy clay loam soil textures in the argillic horizon. Salas soils have 25 to 35 percent clay. Wandurn soils are deep to hard bedrock and have mean annual soil temperatures of 49 to 52 degrees. Wheelerwell soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 52 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Jumbopeak soils are on mountains. Slope ranges from 30 to 75 percent. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from granite, gneiss and schist. Elevations are 3,950 to 6,200 feet. The climate is warm and arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches; mean annual air temperature is 51 to 55 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 140 to 180 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Goldbutte and Nolena soils. Goldbutte and Nolena soils are very shallow to bedrock and do not have a mollic epipedon or an argillic horizon. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; high runoff; moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for forest and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly pinyon, juniper, turbinella oak, green ephedra, desert needlegrass, arid needlegrass, muttongrass, galleta and Joshua tree. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southern Nevada, MLRA 30. These soils are not extensive. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: PHOENIX, ARIZONA

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Clark County Area, Nevada, 2006. Proposed in  Clark County, Nevada, Clark County Soil Survey Area, 2002. The name is coined from Jumbo Peak. Jumbo Peak is located four miles south and 2.5 miles west of this soil type location.
