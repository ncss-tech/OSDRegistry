JICARILLA SERIES

The Jicarilla series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in fine-textured alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Jicarilla soils are on alluvial valley floors, stream terraces, and drainageways with slope gradients of 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Typic Argiaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Jicarilla clay loam, on a west aspect planar slope in grassland at an elevation of 7520 feet. When described on July 12, 1999, the soil was moist from 3 to 80 inches (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Btg2--42 to 60 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) sandy clay loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; weak fine and medium angular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; few faint clay films on ped faces; many coarse prominent yellowish brown(10YR 5/6) redox concentrations; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual smooth boundary.

    2Cg--60 to 80 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) stratified sandy clay loam with thin strata of loamy sand layers, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; single grain and weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; slightly effervescent; many coarse prominent yellowish brown(10YR 5/6) redox concentrations; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).

TYPE LOCATION: Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, about 1.2 mile east of La Jara Lake, located about 1750 feet west, 200 feet north, southeast corner Sec 32,  T 30 N, R 1 W. Cordova Canyon USGS quad; lat. 36 45 43 N. and long. 107 degrees 57 minutes 19 seconds W., NAD 27 .

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture:  The soil moisture control section is affected by precipitation that is evenly distributed throughout the year with the exception of a significant peak during July and August, and a significant decrease from April through June. June is the driest month. (Ustic moisture bordering on aridic.)

Mean annual soil temperature: 42 to 45 degrees F.
Mean summer soil temperature: 58 to 62 degrees F
Thickness of the mollic epipedon: 25 to 46 inches
Depth to lithologic discontinuity: 40 to 80 inches to stratified materials
Depth to the base of the argillic horizon: 40 to 80 inches
Depth to endosaturation: 20 to 40 inches from March to June.

Particle-size control section (weighted average): 
Clay content: 36 to 45 percent
Sand content: 15 to 35 percent fine and coarser sand
Rock fragments: 0 to 5 percent sandstone gravel 

A horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y 
Value: 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 1 or 2

Calcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 5 percent
Reaction: neutral to slightly alkaline

Bt horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y 
Value: 4 to 6 dry , 2 to 4 moist
Chroma: 1 to 2

COMPETING SERIES: The current competitors are the Badger, Lindaas, and Mustinka series.
Badger, Lindass, and Mustinka: formed in glacial lacustrine and till parent materials.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: fine textured mixed alluvium derived from sandstone and shale
Landform: valley floors, drainageways, and low stream terraces
Slopes: 0 to 4 percent 
Elevation: 6,750 to 8,000 feet
Mean annual temperature: 42 to 45 degrees F
Mean summer temperature: 59 degrees to 62 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 16 to 20 inches
Precipitation pattern: Precipitation falls mostly during the months of November through March and July through October. June is the driest month. Total snowfall averages about 4 to 5 feet with snowmelt lasting into April. The soil, however, is saturated with water due to run-on moisture from spring snowmelt.
Frost-free period: 80 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hesperus, Suposo, and Tottles soils. 
Hesperus and Suposo are on higher valley slopes and do not have a water table. 
Tottles soils are in swales and depressions and do not have argillic horizons, and have higher water tables.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly to somewhat poorly drained; low runoff; slow permeability. The water table fluctuates, but is typically within 40 inches of the surface during spring runoff.

USE AND VEGETATION: The major uses are livestock grazing and grass hayland. The native plant community is Kentucky bluegrass, sedges, rushes, and iris.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North Central New Mexico; MLRA 48A. The series is of small extent.
