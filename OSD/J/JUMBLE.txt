JUMBLE SERIES

The Jumble series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till derived dominantly from quartzite and granite. Jumble soils are on moraines. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 750 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 2 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Lamellic Dystrocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jumble extremely stony loam--forestland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered with approximately 20 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, 15 percent stones, and 2 percent boulders.

    Oi--0 to 3 cm; slightly decomposed plant material composed of conifer needles; abrupt wavy boundary. (3 to 8 cm thick)

    A--3 to 15 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely stony loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 15 percent stones; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 13 cm thick)

    E1--15 to 30 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) extremely gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, and medium, and few coarse roots; 50 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary. (13 to 30 cm thick)

    E2--30 to 48 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) extremely cobbly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, common fine, few medium, and coarse roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 35 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles, and 15 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary. (15 to 25 cm thick)

    E and Bt--48 to 155 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) extremely cobbly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist (E part), with common light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) 2 to 10 mm thick lamellae of sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist (Bt part); massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films bridging sand grains and lining pores within lamellae; 15 percent gravel, 45 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones; strongly acid (pH 5.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  White Pine County, Nevada; in Great Basin National Park about 1,000 feet southeast of Wheeler Peak Campground; USGS Windy Peak 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 0 minutes 30.8 seconds N and longitude 114 degrees 17 minutes 55 seconds W; UTM zone 11 733908e, 4321204n, NAD83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture - Usually moist in the moisture control section in winter, spring, and early summer, dry in all parts at least 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice (July and August), but intermittently moist in the upper part for 10 to 20 days cumulative due to convection storms between July and September; Xeric soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature - 3 to 5 degrees C.
Mean summer soil temperature - 7 to 8 degrees C. 
Ochric epipedon thickness - 33 to 61 cm, includes the Oi, A, E1, and E2 horizons.
Depth to top of albic horizon - 5 to 13 cm measured from the mineral soil surface at the top of the A horizon.
Depth to base of cambic horizon - More than 150 cm measured from the mineral soil surface at the top of the A horizon.

Particle size control section - Clay content: 12 to 18 percent.
Rock fragments: 50 to 80 percent, dominantly cobbles and stones. Lithology of fragments is mainly quartzite.

A horizon - Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.
Reaction: Moderately acid or slightly acid.

E horizons - Chroma: 2 or 3 moist.
Clay content: 12 to 18 percent.
Rock fragments: 50 to 80 percent, dominantly cobbles and stones.
Reaction: Strongly acid to slightly acid.
Other features: These horizons constitute both an albic horizon and part of the cambic horizon.

E and Bt horizon - Chroma: 2 or 3 moist.
Clay content: 12 to 18 percent.
Rock fragments: 50 to 80 percent, dominantly cobbles and stones.
Reaction: Strongly acid to slightly acid.
Lamellae: 2 to 10 mm thick sandy loam or sandy clay loam lamellae are present, with cumulative thickness of 3 to 13 cm.

COMPETING SERIES: There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Jumble soils are on moraines. These soils formed in till derived dominantly from quartzite with local admixtures of granite. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 2,860 to 3,368 meters. The climate is humid with cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 600 to 950 mm, the mean annual temperature is 1.5 to 4 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 50 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Gaia and Lemcave series. Gaia soils have a mollic epipedon. Lemcave soils are sandy-skeletal .

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Jumble soils are used for recreation, watershed, and wildlife habitat. The native potential vegetation is mainly a forest canopy of Engelmann's spruce, limber pine, and quaking aspen. This site is correlated to Ecological Site F28AY083NV Engelmann's spruce-mountain gooseberry-mountain brome and needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28A.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: White Pine County, Great Basin National Park, Nevada, 2009. The name is coined.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Organic soil material - The zone from the soil surface to about 3 cm (Oi horizon).
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 48 cm (Oi, A, E1, and E2 horizons).
Albic horizon - The zone from 15 to 48 cm (E1 and E2 horizons).
Cambic horizon - The zone from 15 to 155 cm (E1, E2, and E and Bt horizons).
Lamellae - The zone from 48 to 155 cm (E and Bt horizon).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 28 to 103 cm measured from the mineral soil surface at the top of the A horizon (parts of the E1, E2, and E and Bt horizons).

The revision of March 2001 updated the taxonomic classification from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, nonacid Alfic Cryorthents, adjusted all horizon depths for the Oi horizon as the soil surface, and verified the presence of both albic and cambic horizons.
