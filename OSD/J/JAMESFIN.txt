JAMESFIN SERIES 

The Jamesfin series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in silty alluvium derived from limestone, sandstone, siltstone, shale, and loess. These nearly level soils are on flood plains and low stream terraces of major streams and rivers. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 44 inches. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Dystric Fluventic Eutrudepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Jamesfin silt loam on a floodplain on a 2 percent slope in a pasture on an elevation of 1,020 feet.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   A--0 to 5 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) silt loam; weak fine granular structure; friable; many very fine and fine roots; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 32 inches thick)

   Bw1--5 to 20 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; many very fine and fine roots; common faint discontinuous dark brown (10YR 3/3) organic coats on faces of peds; few fine rounded black (N 2/0) iron-manganese concretions between peds; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. 

   Bw2--20 to 40 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silt loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; common very fine roots; few distinct discontinuous dark brown (10YR 3/3) organic coats on faces of peds; common fine rounded black (N 2/0) iron-manganese concretions between peds; 1 percent rounded limestone-cherty gravel; neutral (pH 7.1); clear smooth boundary. 

   Bw3--40 to 50 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam; weak very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; friable; common very fine roots; very few distinct patchy dark brown (10YR 3/3) organic coats on faces of peds; few fine rounded black (N 2/0) iron-manganese concretions between peds; neutral (pH 7.1); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the Bw horizon is 15 to 75 inches)

   BC--50 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) and light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silt loam; weak medium prismatic structure; friable; few fine rounded black (N 2/0) iron-manganese concretions between peds; neutral (pH 6.9). (0 to 30 inches thick)

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Kinnick, Nolin, and Ray series.  Kinnick and Nolin soils have an active CEC/clay ratio. In addition, Kinnick soils have an apparent water table and low chroma clay depletions within 72 inches.  Ray soils have a low chroma mottles and evident stratification within 40 inches of the surface.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on nearly level flood plains and low stream terraces that are subject to flooding. They formed in silty alluvium derived from limestone, sandstone, siltstone, shale, and loess. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 55 to 58 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 40 to 46 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cedargap, Bearthicket, Horsecreek, Pinerun, and Secesh series. Bearthicket, Horsecreek, Pinerun, and Secesh soils have argillic horizons and are on slightly higher landscape positions.  Cedargap soils have a mollic epipedon, are loamy-skeletal, and are on similar landscape positions.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Runoff is negligible or low. Permeability is moderate. These soils are subject to occasional or frequent flooding.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used for growing corn, sorghum, soybeans, wheat, pasture and hay.  The native vegetation is mixed hardwoods, such as river birch, poplar, sycamore, elm, willow, boxelder, red maple, oak species and hickory; canebrakes in places. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Ozarks area (MLRA 116A & 116B) of southern Missouri and possibly northern Arkansas and southeast Kansas, and adjacent areas in MLRA 115. The series is of moderate extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Stone County, Missouri, 1998. 

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are: 
1)  Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 5 inches (A horizon)
2)  Cambic horizon - the zone from 5 to 50 inches (Bw horizons)    

These soils were previously mapped with the Nolin series in Missouri.

ADDITIONAL DATA: University of Missouri soil characterization lab number:  M9220941 and pedon site ID is 92MO209176. Laboratory data shows clay activity of this series is borderline to active. The type location is 0.57 CEC/clay ratio but the representative value of all pedons sampled is between 0.60 and 0.65.
