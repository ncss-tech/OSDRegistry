JEFFCITY SERIES 

The Jeffcity series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium or residuum derived from granite bedrock.  These soils are on bedrock-floored plains, hills, structural benches, and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jeffcity loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).
