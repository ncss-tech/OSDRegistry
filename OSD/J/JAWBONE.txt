JAWBONE SERIES

The Jawbone series consists of shallow, excessively drained soils that formed in material weathered from granitic rocks. Jawbone soils are on mountainous side slopes and ridges and have slopes of 8 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, thermic, shallow Typic Torripsamments 

TYPICAL PEDON: Jawbone loamy sand, on a 13 percent slope under desert shrubs at an elevation of 1,179 meters. When described the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) Surface rock fragments: 35 percent fine gravel and 21 percent medium and coarse gravel and 1 percent cobbles.

  A--0 to 5 centimeters (0 to 2 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 8 percent fine gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. 

  Bw--5 to 14 centimeters (2 to 5 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine irregular and common fine tubular pores; 9 percent fine gravel and 1 percent medium and coarse gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt wavy boundary.

  Cr--14 to 40(5 to 16 inches); soft weathered granitic bedrock, with moderate excavation difficulty.

TYPE LOCATION: Kern County, California; 490 meters south and 470 meters west of the corner of section 12, T 27 S., R 37 E., MDBM; USGS Freeman Junction, California 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; 35 degrees, 36 minutes, 12.6 seconds north latitude and 117 degrees, 56 minutes, 33.8 seconds west longitude; UTM 11S 414609e, 394038n; (DTM: NAD83). 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture control section: Usually dry, moist in some part during winter and spring and intermittingly moist near the soil surface following occasional summer convection storms. The soils have a Typic-Aridic soil moisture regime.
Soil temperature: 15 to 22 degrees C.
Depth to paralithic contact: 10 to 30 centimeters.

Control section
Clay content: 3 to 7 percent.
Rock fragments: 1 to 20 percent gravel.

A horizon
Value: 5 to 7, dry; and 4 to 6, moist.
Chroma: 3 or 4, moist or dry.

Bw, C, or Ck horizon
Chroma: 3 or 4, moist or dry.
Texture: loamy sand, sand, or coarse sand.
Rock fragments: 1 to 20 percent gravel.
Effervescence: none to violently.

COMPETING SERIES: This is Ironped series. Ironped soils receive summer precipitation and are moist 10 to 20 days cumulative in the moisture control section following summer convection storms. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Jawbone soils are on mountainous side slopes and ridges. Elevations are 730 to 1,340 meters. Slope gradients are 8 to 75 percent. The soils formed from weathered granitic rocks. The climate is arid or semiarid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 125 to 300 centimeters. Mean annual temperature is about 15 to 22 degrees C.. The freeze-free season is 210 to 270 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Typic Haplargids, Koehn (T CA) and Dovecanyon (T CA) soils).  Typic Haplargids are on backslopes of hills and have an argillic horizon above the moderately deep bedrock.  Koehn soils are found in drainageways and are very deep.  Dovecanyon soils are on fan remnants, have an argillic horizon and are very deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Excessively drained; rapid to very rapid runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for recreation and range. Vegetation is mostly, creosotebush, white bursage and desert needlegrass.  At higher elevations vegetation is blackbrush, creosotebush and Sandberg bluegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwestern portion of the Mojave Desert in California. MLRA 30. The soils are of small extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California. 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Kern County, California, 1976.  

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the profile are:

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 14 centimeters (A and Bw horizons).

Paralithic contact: 14 centimeters (Cr horizon).
