JIMBEE SERIES  

The Jimbee series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium from limestone on ridges, foothills and mountains.  Permeability is  moderate.  Slopes are 10 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic Lithic Calcicryolls  

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jimbee gravelly loam--on a 30 percent convex,  north-facing slope in rangeland at 6,400 feet elevation.  (Colors are  for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on August 18, 1986,  the soil was slightly moist throughout.)  

    A1--0 to 3 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard,  very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and  common fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; 20 percent gravel, 5  percent cobbles; strongly effervescent (45 percent calcium carbonate  equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to  8 inches thick)  

    A2--3 to 6 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very  friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common  fine and few medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; 20 percent  gravel, 5 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent (50 percent calcium  carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy  boundary. (0 to 5 inches thick)  

    Bkq1--6 to 9 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown  (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly  hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common  fine and few medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; 30 percent  gravel, 5 percent cobbles; prominent lime and silica coatings and  pendants on undersides of coarse fragments; violently effervescent (55  percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.2);  clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 7 inches thick)  

    Bkq2--9 to 16 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly loam,  yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure;  slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and  few fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 35 percent gravel, 5  percent cobbles; prominent lime and silica coatings and pendants on  undersides and sides of coarse fragments; violently effervescent (55  percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (5 to 8 inches thick)  

    R--16 inches; hard limestone.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jimbee soils are on ridges, foothills and mountains. These  soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium from limestone.  Slopes are 10 to 75  percent.  Elevations are 5,500 to 9,000 feet.  The climate is cold and  moist in winter and spring and cool and dry in summer.  Average annual  precipitation is 11 to 13 inches; average annual temperature is 36 to 40  degrees F.  The frost-free period is 10 to 65 days.  

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Simeroi,  and Sparmo soils.  Simeroi and Sparmo  soils are on fan terraces and are very deep.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained. Medium and rapid runoff.  Moderate permeability.  

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland.  Vegetation is mainly low sagebrush and  bluebunch wheatgrass.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central Idaho.  These soils are not  extensive.
