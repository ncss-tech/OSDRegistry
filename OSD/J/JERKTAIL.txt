JERKTAIL SERIES

The Jerktail series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in silty colluvium and the underlying clayey residuum weathered from dolomite. These soils are on nearly level and very gently sloping upland divides. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Banister, Branchville, Cardinal, Celina, Eudy, Hartville, Lewisburg, Loudon, and Whippany series. Branchville, Cardinal, Celina, Hartville, Lewisburg, and Whippany soils are deeper than 80 inches to a lithic or paralithic contact. In addition, Banister soils formed in clayey alluvium on terraces, Branchville soils have more than 15 percent sandstone fragments in the upper half of the series control section, Cardinal soils have a mean annual soil temperature of less than 53 degrees F., Celina soils have free carbonates from 18 to 40 inches, Lewisburg soils have carbonates from 8 to 18 inches, and Whippany soils have a mean annual soil temperature of less than 55 degrees F..  Eudy soils have a lithic contact from 20 to 40 inches. Loudon soils have a paralithic contact from 60 to 80 inches and have carbonates from 32 to 65 inches. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Jerktail soils are on nearly level and very gently sloping upland divides. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. They formed in silty colluvium and the underlying residuum weathered from cherty dolomite. Elevations are 1,100 to 1,500 feet.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 45 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Eudy, Gunlock, Mano, Ocie and Tonti soils. Eudy soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches and are on similar positions. Gunlock soils have fragic properties, do not have bedrock at 60 to 80 inches and are on foot slopes. Mano and Ocie soils have contrasting particle size control sections and are on side slopes. In addition, Ocie soils have bedrock at 40 to 60 inches. Tonti soils have a fragipan, do not have bedrock at 60 to 80 inches and are on similar positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Runoff potential is typically medium to high, but is negligible in concave postions. Permeability is slow, and the saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low. A perched water table is at a depth of 1 to 2 feet in most years.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used mainly for hay and pasture. Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Ozarks Highland region (MLRA 116A) of southern Missouri. The series is of moderate extent.
