JACQUES SERIES

The Jacques series consists of very deep, well drained soils on alluvial fans, stream terraces and flood plains.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Slope is 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Cumulic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Jacques clay loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 2 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; many fine and medium roots; many fine interstitial pores; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 3 inches thick)

    A2--2 to 10 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many fine and medium roots; many very fine interstitial and few fine tubular pores; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 12 inches thick)

    C1--10 to 24 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine roots; common very fine tubular and few fine interstitial pores; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (12 to 20 inches thick)

    C2--24 to 60 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; massive; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine roots; common very fine tubular and few fine interstitial pores; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5).

TYPE LOCATION: Gila County, Arizona. Northwest 1/4 of section 36, T. 4 N., R. 22 E.; in an unsectionized area on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture: Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July - September and December - February.  Driest during May and June.  Aridic ustic soil moisture regime.

Soil temperature: 47 to 56 degrees F.

Rock fragments: 0 to 20 percent

Calcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 10 percent

Reaction: neutral to moderately alkaline

Organic matter: more than 1 percent in the upper pedon that decreases irregularly with depth

A horizon
Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR
Value: 3, 4, or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist

C horizons
Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 2 through 4, dry or moist
Texture: stratified sandy clay loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, clay loam, clay, sandy clay; averages 35 to 50 percent clay in the control section but ranges from 15 to 50 percent

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bagley (AZ) and Rune (AZ) series.  Bagley soils have an ustic aridic soil moisture regime.  Rune soils have hue of 5YR or redder.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Jacques soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, and flood plains and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium from basalt, schist, shale and sandstone with some limestone influence.  Elevations range from 5000 to 7500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 18 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 115 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Tours, Lynx and Navajo series.  Tours soils are fine-silty.  Lynx soils are fine-loamy.  Navajo soils have high shrink-swell properties and do not have mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation consists of blue grama, sand dropseed, galleta, ring muhlenbergia, rabbitbrush, and some scattered juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Arizona.  The series of small extent.  MLRA is 38 and 39.
