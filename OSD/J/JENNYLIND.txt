JENNYLIND SERIES

The Jennylind series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum derived from acidic tuff. Jennylind soils are in microhigh positions on erosion remnants with mound and swale microrelief. Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 500 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 17 degrees C.            

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Lithic Haploxerepts 

TYPICAL PEDON: Jennylind sandy loam on a west-facing, 4 percent, convex slope, under annual grasses and forbs at an elevation of 165 meters. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. When described on May 20, 2014 the soil was dry throughout.)

 A--0 to 7 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine granular structure; friable, slightly hard, nonsticky, nonplastic; many very fine roots; few very fine interstitial pores and common fine tubular pores; 12 percent subrounded indurated acidic tuff gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.2); clear wavy boundary. (1 to 15 cm thick)     

 Bw1--7 to 28 cm; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) sandy loam, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6), moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable, moderately hard, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 12 percent subrounded indurated acidic tuff gravel; very strongly acid (pH 4.7); clear wavy boundary.

 Bw2--28 to 50 cm; strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; friable, hard, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 10 percent subrounded indurated acidic tuff gravel; extremely acid (pH 4.1); abrupt wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bw horizons is 15 to 50 cm)

 R--50 to 200 cm; white (2.5Y 8/1) strongly cemented acidic tuff bedrock; extremely acid (pH 4.1).

TYPE LOCATION: Calaveras County, California, about 1.6 km (1 mile) south of Comanche Reservoir, USGS 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle: Wallace, California; WGS84 38.2061416 latitude and -120.8914777 longitude; UTM Zone 10 684614 meters E 4230788 meters N NAD83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil temperature: The mean annual soil temperature at the lithic contact is 15 to 17 degrees C and the difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is greater than 6 degrees C. The soils have a thermic temperature regime.      

Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from about May to October. The soils have a xeric soil moisture regime.

Diagnostic Feature(s):
  Ochric epipedon thickness:  18 cm
  Cambic horizon thickness:  15 to 45 cm.

  Base saturation: Less than 50 percent in the control section (By ammonium acetate)

Particle size control section weighted average:
  Rock fragments: 0 to 20 percent, with 0 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles
  Clay content: averages 5 to 25 percent clay

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Auburn and Toomes soils. Auburn soil form on hills in material weathered from metamorphic rock (i.e. schist) and has hues of  5YR. Toomes soils form on lava plateaus and are somewhat excessively drained. Toomes soils form in material weathered from tuff breccia, basalt, andesite, or latite. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Jennylind soils are on mound positions on mound and swale microrelief on erosion remnants. Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent. These soils formed in residuum derived from acidic tuff mainly associated with the Valley Springs Formation. Elevation is 60 to 650 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 450 to 915 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 15 to 17 degrees C. The frost free season is 235 to 340 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Amador, Gillender, Laniger, Miltonhills, Ospital, Pardee, Pentz, and Redding soils. Ospital soils lack a cambic horizon, have a lithic contact within 25 cm, and are in swales. Amador, Gillender, and Pentz have a paralithic contact within 50 centimeters. Pentz has a mollic epipedon. Pardee soils are loamy-skeletal. Redding soils have a duripan within 50 to 100 centimeters. Laniger soils have andic soil properties and lithic contact within 50 to 100 centimeters. Miltonhills has an umbric epipedon and a paralithic contact between 50 and 100 cm.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderately high to high saturated hydraulic conductivity throughout the profile.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock is very low to low. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are mainly used for livestock grazing. Vegetation is annual grasses and forbs. Species include bromes, clover, filaree, wild oat, popcornflower, andbulbous bluegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Foothills of California; MLRA 18. The series is not extensive.
