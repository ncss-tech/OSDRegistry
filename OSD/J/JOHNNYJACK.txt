JOHNNYJACK SERIES

The Johnnyjack series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary sources. Johnnyjack soils are on stream terraces in mountain river valleys. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 2030 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 14 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, thermic Cumulic Ultic Haploxerolls

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Lupoyoma (CA) series. Lupoyoma soils have pH values greater than 6.0 and unprotected areas are subject to rare flooding.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Johnnyjack soils are on linear to slightly concave positions on stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Elevations are 18 to 100 meters. These soils formed in alluvium from mixed sedimentary rocks 18 degrees C and the difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures is 6 degrees C or greater. The soil has a thermic temperature regime. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers with a marine layer influence and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1525 to 2500 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is 13 to 15 degrees C. Frost free season is about 240 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Conklin (CA) soil. Conklin soils have more than 15 percent (by weight) particles with diameters greater than 0.1 millimeters in the particle size control section. Conklin soils occur on linear to slightly convex positions on terraces. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; negligible to medium runoff; moderately low to moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used mainly for pasture, hay, orchards, and irrigated vegetable crops. The vegetation is perennial and annual grasses and forbs including oats, soft brome, smooth brome, ryegrass, bristly dogstail grass, and foxtail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The series is not extensive. Coastal Redwood Belt MLRA 4B.
