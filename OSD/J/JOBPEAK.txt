JOBPEAK SERIES 

The Jobpeak series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Jobpeak soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes are 50 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, nonacid, mesic Lithic Xeric Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jobpeak very gravelly loam--forestland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered with approximately 30 percent cobbles and 50 percent gravel. 

    A1--0 to 5 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) very gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine interstitial and common very fine tubular pores; 35 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 10 cm thick) 

    A2--5 to 20 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) very gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 40 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (5 to 20 cm thick) 

    2R--20 cm; hard reddish basalt. 

TYPE LOCATION:  Churchill County, Nevada; about 48 miles northeast of Fallon in the Stillwater Range; 2,200 feet south and 2,400 feet west of the northeast corner of section 8, T. 23 N., R. 35 E.; USGS Dixie Hot Springs NE 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 52 minutes 41 seconds N and longitude 118 degrees 3 minutes 59.5 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.8780556 latitude, -118.0665278 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: Moist in winter and spring, dry in summer and autumn; aridic soil moisture regime that borders on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature; 8 to 11 degrees C. 
Depth to bedrock: 10 to 30 cm to a lithic contact. 
Reaction: Neutral or slightly alkaline. 

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 10 to 18 percent. 
Rock fragments: 35 to 60 percent, predominantly gravel. 

A horizons
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y.
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist. 
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist. 
Structure: Subangular blocky or platy. 
Other features: Some pedons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR which are lithochromic (bedrock) colors.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Lequieu, Medved, Mizel, Skedaddle, Smallcone, Snaker, Tejabe and Wahguyhe series. 

Lequieu soils have mean annual soil temperature of 11 to 12 degrees C. and have 20 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Medved soils have a C horizon with more than 90 percent rock fragments. Mizel soils have a reaction class that is medium acid or slightly acid. Skedaddle soils average 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Smallcone soils have reaction class that is strongly acid or moderately acid. Snaker soils are 25 to 50 cm to bedrock and have rock fragments which are dominantly channers. Tejabe soils are moist in the upper part of the moisture control section for 10 to 20 days cumulative during summer and autumn. Wahguyhe soils are 36 to 50 cm to bedrock. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jobpeak soils are on hills and mountains. They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Slopes are 50 to 75 percent. Elevations are 1,707 to 2,347 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Singatse and Segura series. Singatse soils are loamy-skeletal, very shallow, calcareous, and have a typic torric moisture regime. Segura soils are loamy, very shallow and shallow, have mollic epipedons and argillic horizons, and have a frigid soil temperature regime.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Jobpeak soils are used for livestock grazing, wood products, and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is a forest canopy of singleleaf pinyon and Utah juniper with an understory of pine bluegrass, Sandberg bluegrass, and mountain big sagebrush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 27.
