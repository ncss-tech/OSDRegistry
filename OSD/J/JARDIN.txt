JARDIN SERIES

The Jardin series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed from eolian sands mixed with calcareous, loamy residuum of the Goliad Formation. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (72 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 584 mm (23 in). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, hyperthermic, shallow Petrocalcic Paleustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Jardin fine sandy loam in rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

	A1--0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 in); brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular and subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; common fine and very fine roots; few fine and very fine pores; few fine root channels and insect tunnels; few indurated calcrete fragments up to 2.5 cm (1 in) across their long axis; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.

	A2--23 to 43 cm (9 to 17 in); brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak fine and medium subangular blocky; hard, friable; few fine and very fine roots and pores; few fine root channels and insect tunnels; few indurated calcrete fragments up to 2.5 cm (1 in)across their long axis; moderately alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary. (combined thickness of the A horizon ranges from 30 to 48 cm [12 to 19 in])

	Bkkm1--43 to 56 cm (17 to 22 in); very pale brown (10YR 8/2) strongly cemented calcium carbonate; somewhat platy and fractured in upper 2 to 3 inches, massive below; upper surface is etched and contains a few brownish bands; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. (combined thickness of the Bkkm horizons is 155 to 173 cm [61 to 68 in])

	Bkkm2--56 to 152 cm (22 to 60 in); very pale brown (10YR 8/2) weakly cemented calcium carbonate; massive but contains a few fractures spaced further than 10 cm (4 in) apart;moderately alkaline. 

TYPE LOCATION: Brooks County, Texas; from junction of Farm Roads 755 and 430, 5.1 miles north and west of Farm Road 430 to Alta Colorado Ranch entrance, 1.7 miles west on ranch road, 0.6 mile north on ranch road, 3.4 miles west of ranch road and 50 feet north in rangeland. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: An ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic. The soil moisture control section remains moist in some or all parts for less than 90 consecutive days in normal years. The soil is driest during the months June through August and December through February. These soils are intermittently moist in September through November and March through May.
Mean annual soil temperature: 21 to 23 degrees C (70 to 73 degrees F)
Depth to petrocalcic horizon: 18 to 46 cm (7 to 18 in) 

A Horizon 
Hue: 10 YR 
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 2 or 3 
Texture: fine sandy loam or loam 
Clay content: 12 to 18 percent 
Rock fragments: 0 to 10 percent (A2 Horizon has up to 25 percent fragments) 
Effervescence: noneffervescent 
Reaction: neutral to moderately alkaline

Bkkm Horizon
Hue: 10YR
Value: 8
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: weakly to indurated calcium carbonate (petrocalcic)
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 40 to 80 percent 
Effervescence: violently effervescent 
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkalineThe 

COMPETING SERIES: There are no series in the same family. Similar soils are Cuevitas(TX), Jimenez(TX), Mierhill(TX), Mitre(TX), Olmedo(TX), Parrita(TX), Quemado(TX), Randado(TX), Upton(TX), Yologo(TX), and Zapata(TX). 
Cuevitas, Quemado, Randado, Upton, and Zapata soils: do not have mollic epipedons. 
Jimenez, Mierhill, Mitre, Olmedo, Quemado, and Yologo soils: have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in their sola. 
Parrita, Quemado, Randado, and Yologo soils: have argillic horizons. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: eolian sands mixed with calcareous, loamy residuum of the Goliad Formation 
Landform: interfluves 
Slope: 0 to 3 percent 
Mean annual air temperature range: 21 to 23 degrees C (72 to 74 degrees F) 
Mean annual precipitation range: 559 to 635 mm (22 to 25 in) 
Frost-free period: 280 to 320 days 
Elevation: 76 to 210 m (245 to 685 ft) 
Thornthwaite annual P-E indices: 19 to 31

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the competing Cuevitas and Randado series and Comitas, Delfina, Delmita, Nueces, and Sarita series. 
Comitas, Delfina, Delmita, Nueces, and Sarita soils: on lower positions on vegetated sandsheet and have sola more than 51 cm (20 in) thick and have argillic horizons.
Cuevitas and Randado soils occur on similar positions and have ochric epipedons. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, medium runoff; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used primarily for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. In excellent condition mid grasses such as feather bluestem Arizona cottontop, plains bristlegrass, tanglehead and pink pappusgrass dominate. Major forbs include orange zexmenia, bushsunflower, velvet bundleflower and Oenothera spp. Dominant woody plants are guajillo, spiny hackberry, blackbrush, leatherstem, and Texas kidneywood. Woody species increase during extended periods of overgrazing. The ecological site is Shallow Sandy Loam, PE 19-31 (R083CY487TX).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Rio Grande Plain of Texas; LRR I; MLRA 83C; minor extent.
