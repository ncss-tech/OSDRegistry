JARAB SERIES

The Jarab series consists of shallow to an indurated duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from quartzite, limestone and reworked lacustrine deposits. Jarab soils are on intermountain valley fans, alluvial fans and fan remnants. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Haploduridic Durixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Jarab cobbly loam--woodland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 5 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) cobbly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak thick platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common very fine vesicular pores; 25 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 cm thick)

    A2--5 to 13 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common fine interstitial and tubular pores; 30 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 13 cm thick)

    Bqk--13 to 25 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; many fine tubular and interstitial pores; 45 percent indurated pan fragments up to 8 cm in diameter; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (10 to 30 cm thick)

    Bqkm--25 to 89 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) cemented material, light gray (10YR 7/2) moist; continuous indurated thin (0.75 to 3 mm) silica laminae capping and randomly integrated with weakly and strongly carbonate-cemented material that alternates with thin strata of very pale brown (10YR 7/3), soft calcareous gravelly loam; carbonate-cemented material is very pale brown (10YR 8/2) and very pale brown (10YR 8/3), and light gray (10YR 7/2) when moist; massive; very hard and extremely hard; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Lincoln County, Nevada; about 1.5 miles southeast of Pioche; approximately 1,300 feet south and 600 feet east of the northwest corner of section 25, T. 1 N., R. 67 E; USGS Pioche 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 37 degrees 55 minutes 14 seconds N and longitude 114 degrees 25 minutes 32 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 37.9205556 latitude, -114.4255556 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist in winter or spring, dry in summer and fall except for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and September due to convection storms: aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 14 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 18 to 25 cm thick.
Depth to duripan: 25 to 50 cm.
Effervescence: Strongly effervescent or violently effervescent.
Reaction: Slightly alkaline through strongly alkaline.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 18 to 35 percent.
Rock fragments: 35 to 50 percent, mainly gravel.  Lithology of fragments is quartzite, limestone, and strongly cemented to indurated pan fragments.

A horizons
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR.
Value: 4 or 5, dry.
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.

Bqk horizon
Hue: 10YR through 5YR.
Value: 5 through 8 dry, 3 through 7 moist.
Chroma: 2 through 4, dry or moist.
Texture: Loam or clay loam.
Clay content: 20 to 35 percent.
Rock fragments: 35 to 50 percent.
Structure: Subangular blocky, or massive.
Consistence: Soft to hard, dry, very friable to firm moist, slightly sticky or moderately sticky or slightly plastic or moderately plastic, wet.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Jarab soils are on intermountain valley fans, alluvial fans or fan remnants. These soils formed in alluvium derived from quartzite, limestone, and reworked lacustrine deposits. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Elevations are 1,700 to 2,250 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, generally dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 350 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 11 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Pioche, Kyler, and Roval soils. Roval soils have argillic horizons and less than 35 percent rock fragments. Pioche soils are less than 50 cm to quartzite bedrock and have argillic horizons. Kyler soils are less than 50 cm to limestone bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Jarab soil are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Principle native vegetation is black sagebrush, Stansbury cliffrose, low Douglas rabbitbrush, Nevada ephedra, Utah juniper, and scattered Indian ricegrass, and needleandthread. This pedon is correlated to ecological site number R029XY170NV, Shallow Calcareous Loam 10-12 P.Z.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: East-central Nevada. These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 29, 28A, 28B.
