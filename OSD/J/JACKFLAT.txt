JACKFLAT SERIES

The Jackflat series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium derived from granodiorite.  Jackflat soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 500 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Xeric Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jackflat very gravelly coarse sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is covered with 25 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, and 2 percent stones.

    Bt3--58 to 114 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very stony sandy clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and few prominent clay films lining pores; 25 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, and 20 percent stones; 25 percent paragravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary.  (38 to 58 cm thick)

    2Cr--114 cm; weathered granodiorite.

TYPE LOCATION:  Mono County, California; on the Toiyabe National Forest about 1 mile northeast of Wild Horse Mountain on Jackass Flat; in a nonsectionized township near the projected southeast corner of section 18, T. 8 N., R. 24 E.; USGS Risue Canyon latitude 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; 38 degrees 32 minutes 5.9 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 22 minutes 32.5 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.5349722 latitude, -119.3756944 longitude.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Boneyard, Chamberlain, Cowlow, Crandall, Forsey, Fourme, Itwo, Packer, Scuffe, Stopatoe, Successloop, Tagum, Toquima, Winada, and Zeebar series.

Bonyard, Cowlow, Itwo, and Toquima soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Chamberlain, Forsey, Fourme, Successloop and Zeebar soils are very deep.  Crandall soils are deep to lithic contacts and have horizons with secondary carbonates.  Packer soils are deep and very deep to lithic contacts and have depth to the base of the argillic horizon within 53 cm of the soil surface. Scuffe, Stopatoe, Tagum, and Winada soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jackflat soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on summit and shoulder positions.  They formed in colluvium and slope alluvium derived from granodiorite.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 2,440 to 2,740 meters.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 600 mm, the mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bakscratch, Elaero, and Grandridge soils.  Bakscratch soils are shallow to paralithic contacts.  Elaero soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts and have a frigid temperature regime.  Grandridge soils are shallow to paralithic contacts and have a frigid temperature regime.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Jackflat soils are used for rangeland, recreation, watershed, and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, snowberry, and western needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern California, on the east side of the Sierra Nevada Range.  These soils are not extensive with about 700 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRAs 22A and 26.
