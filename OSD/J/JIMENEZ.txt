JIMENEZ SERIES

The Jimenez series consists of very shallow to shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in gravelly loamy alluvium.  The soils are on gently sloping knobs of paleoterraces.Slope ranges from 1 to about 30 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F.) and mean annual precipitation is about 533 mm (21 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, active, hyperthermic, shallow Petrocalcic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jimenez very gravelly loam in an area of Jimenez association, rolling in rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A--0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 in); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak granular structure; slightly hard, friable; 70 percent by volume of water-worn quartzite, chert, limestone, sandstone, and basalt pebbles mostly less than 6 cm in diameter; calcareous; moderately alkaline abrupt wavy boundary.  (18 to 51 cm [7 to 20 in] thick)

     Bkkm1--23 to 46 cm (9 to 18 in); white (10YR 8/1) strongly cemented calcium carbonate with about 40 percent of the mass consisting of embedded gravel; 12 mm (1/2 in) laminar cap, and has a hardness of 3 (Moh's scale) when dry; moderately alkaline; diffuse irregular boundary.  (23 to 46 cm [2 to 20 in] thick)

     Bkkm2--46 to 152 cm (18 to 60 in); white (10YR 8/1) weakly cemented calcium carbonate with about 50 percent embedded gravel; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Maverick County, Texas; from the intersection of U.S. Highway 277 and FM 1591 north of Quemado, Texas; 4.5 miles north on U.S. Highway 277; site is 100 feet east in rangeland.  Tequesquite Creek SW, TX USGS topographic quadrangle; Latitude: 29 degrees,1 minute, 30.3 seconds N.; Longitude: 100 degrees, 38 minutes, 17.5 seconds W.; NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
The pebbles on the surface are uncoated.

A horizon
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 2 or 3 
Texture: very gravelly loam, very gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly sandy clay loam 
Clay content: 12 to 27 percent
Coarse fragments: 35 to 80 percent. The pebbles are rounded and are mostly siliceous but include lesser amounts of limestone, basalts, and sandstone. In some pedons the pebbles have coatings of calcium carbonate 1 to 5 mm thick.  
Calcium carbonate equivalent is 1 to 40 percent.

Bkkm1 horizon
Hue: 10YR
Value: 8
Chroma: 2
Cementation: strongly cemented calium carbonate laminar cap; estimated hardness is 2.5 to 3.0 on the Moh's scale; some pedons may be fractured and platy-like in the upper part; 40 percent embedded gravels

Bkkm2 horizon
Hue: 10YR
Value: 8
Chroma: 2
Cementation: weakly cemented calcium carbonate with about 50 percent embedded gravels.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no series in this family. Similar soils are Amistad (TX), Boracho (TX), Ector (TX), Kimbrough (NM), Langtry (TX), Olmos (TX), Quemado (TX), Real (TX), Valco (TX), Zapata (TX), and Zorra (TX) series.
Amistad, Boracho, Ector, Kimbrough, and Real soils: have mean annual soil temperatures less than 72 degrees F. In addition, Amistad, Ector, Langtry, and Real soils, as well as, Olmos and Zorra soils have carbonatic mineralogy.  
Quemado soils: have an ochric epipedon and argillic horizon.  
Valco soils: contain less than 35 percent coarse fragments.
Zapata soils: are in a loamy family and have an ochric epipedon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent Material: gravelly, loamy alluvium mostly 3 to 20 feet thick which rests on limestone, calcareous clays, or shales.
Landform: knobs on paleoterraces, generally paralleling the Rio Grande 
Slope: 1 to 30 percent, but the average is about 10 percent. 
Mean annual air temperature: 21 to 23 degrees C (70 to 74 degrees F).
Mean annual precipitation: 457 to 559 mm (18 to 22 in).
Frost-free period: 270 to 341 days.
Thornthwaite P-E Index: 21 to 26.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Copita, Maverick, Quemado, Verick, and Zapata series.  
Copita soils: are on similar positions, moderately deep to sandstone, and are fine-loamy.
Maverick soils: are on similar positions, moderately deep to mudstone, and are clayey.
Quemado soils: occur at higher positions and have less slope gradient.  
Zapata soils: occur at lower positions, are loamy, and have ochric surfaces.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; Permeabilitly is moderate. Runoff is negligible on less than 1 percent slopes, low on slopes between 1 to 5 percent, medium on slopes between 5 to 20 percent and high on slopes more than 20 percent.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used as native range for sheep, goats, cattle, and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation consists of mid grasses, a few short grasses, about 25 percent woody shrubs and 5 percent perennial forbs. With retrogression, woody plants, dominated by guajillo and blackbrush, form a dense canopy.  Other increasers and invaders are threeawn, hairy tridens, and red grama. The ecological site is Gravelly Ridge 18-35 PZ (R083BY419TX).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Rio Grande Plain, Texas; LRR I, MLRA 83B.  The series is of large extent.
