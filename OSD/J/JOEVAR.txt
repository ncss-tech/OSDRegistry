JOEVAR SERIES

The Joevar series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in silty alluvium derived dominantly from loess.  Permeability is moderate.  These soils are on terraces and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Cumulic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Joevar silt loam - on a nearly level alluvial terrace in an irrigated grainfield at 4,800 feet elevation.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap1--0 to 4 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots, common medium roots, and few coarse roots; many very fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; mildly alkaline pH (7.8); abrupt smooth boundary.   (2 to 6 inches thick)

    Ap2--4 to 10 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots, and common medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

    Bw1--10 to 25 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots and common fine and medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); clear wavy boundary.  (12 to 20 inches thick)

    Bw2--25 to 33 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure; very hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots, and few medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; mildly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (7 to 17 inches thick)

    Bkb1--33 to 37 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium angular blocky; extremely hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots and few fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; lime coats on faces of peds and in pores; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Bkb2--37 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; extremely hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; about 5 percent cicada krotovinas; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; lime coats on faces of peds and in pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1).

TYPE LOCATION:  Bannock County, Idaho; about 1 mile north of Virginia; 2,000 feet east and 2,320 feet north of the southwest corner of section.  32, T. 10 S., R. 37 E.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Ret series.  Ret soils are somewhat poorly drained and have coarse sand or gravelly coarse sand below 40 inches.  They have mottles with chroma of 2 or less in the lower part of the particle-size control section and lack a Bk horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Joevar soils are on terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  They formed in silty alluvium derived dominantly from loess.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches, and the average annual temperature ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 75 to 100 days.  Elevation ranges from 4,500 to 5,400 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arbone, Bear Lake, Downata (T), Hondoho, Inkom (T), Lanoak, Rexburg, and Ririe soils.  Arbone soils are coarse-loamy.  Bear Lake and Downata soils are very poorly drained and have fine-silty control sections.  Hondoho soils are loamy-skeletal.  Inkom soils are poorly drained and are fine-silty.  Lanoak soils have pachic epipedons.  Rexburg and Ririe soils have mollic epipedons.  Arbone and Hondoho soils are on fan terraces and terrace escarpments adjacent to the Joevar soils.  Bear Lake, Downata, and Inkom soils occupy lower terraces that are less well drained than the Joevar soils.  Lanoak, Rexburg, and Ririe soils are on loess covered fan terraces above the Joevar soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; runoff is slow or  very slow; permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION:  This Joevar soil is used mainly for irrigated and nonirrigated cropland.  Where not farmed, the potential natural vegetation is mainly basin big sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern, Idaho.  This series is inextensive.
