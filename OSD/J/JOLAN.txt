JOLAN SERIES

The Jolan series consists of moderately deep to an indurated hardpan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed volcanic rocks.  The Jolan soils are on summits of alluvial fan remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haplodurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Jolan gravelly loamy coarse sand--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 5 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly loamy coarse sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, and fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; 20 percent gravel; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 15 cm thick)

    A2--5 to 15 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and few fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (5 to 13 cm thick)

    Bk1--15 to 25 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and few fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (5 to 13 cm thick)

    Bk2--25 to 51 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (18 to 46 cm thick)

    Bqkm--51 to 91 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) indurated duripan, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) and white (10YR 8/1) 1 to 15 mm thick silica and carbonate coating fracture planes; extremely hard, extremely firm; roots matted on fracture planes; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2).

TYPE LOCATION:  Nye County, Nevada; about 1,320 feet east and 1,000 feet south of the northwest corner of section 5, T. 7 N., R. 40 E.; USGS Cloverdale Ranch 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 30 minutes 6 seconds N and longitude 117 degrees 30 minutes 42 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.5016667 latitude, -117.5116667 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, but are moist in some part in winter and spring and 10 to 20 days from June through September from convection storms; typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 14 degrees C.
Depth to indurated duripan: 50 to 75 cm.
Reaction: Moderately alkaline through very strongly alkaline.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  8 to 18 percent.
Rock fragments:  0 to 35 percent.

A horizon
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.

Bk horizons
Value:  5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4.
Texture:  Fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.
Structure:  Massive or weak coarse prismatic.
Consistence:  Soft or slightly hard, nonsticky or slightly sticky, nonplastic or slightly plastic.
Other features:  Few very thin through many thick carbonate coats and pendants on rock fragments.

Bqkm horizon
Value:  4 through 8, dry or moist.
Chroma:  1 through 3.
Structure:  Massive or platy.
Consistence:  Extremely hard or very hard, extremely firm or very firm.
Other features:  Strongly cemented to indurated with 1 to 15 mm thick laminar carbonate and silica cap.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Jenor series.  Jenor soils so not receive the 10 to 20 days summer precipitation and also have soil temperature of 8 to 11 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jolan soils are on nearly level and gently sloping fans.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium derived from latitic, basaltic, rhyolitic, and tuffaceous rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations are 1,370 to 1,710 meters.  The climate is warm and arid with a mean annual precipitation of 100 to 200 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C and the average frost-free season is 100 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Blacka, Bluewing, Dobel, Unsel, and Youngston soils.  Blacka soils lack duripans.  Bluewing soils are sandy-skeletal.  Dobel soils have argillic horizons and have duripans at depths of less than 50 cm.  Unsel soils have argillic horizons and have durinodes in very gravelly sandy substratum.  Youngston soils have fine-loamy particle-size control sections.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow or medium runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity above the hardpan.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Small areas are irrigated and cropped to small grains and alfalfa hay.  The vegetation is principally Bailey greasewood, shadscale, bud sagebrush, galleta, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North central Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 28B, 29.
