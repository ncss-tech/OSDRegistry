QUINCREEK SERIES 

The Quincreek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, and residuum derived from fractured red shale bedrock.  These soils are on alluvial fans, knolls and sideslopes of hills. Slopes are 2 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Quincreek channery loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 3 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) channery loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine and very fine interstitial pores; 20 percent channers; neutral (pH 7.3);  clear wavy boundary. (3 to 7 inches thick) 

    Bt--3 to 9 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) channery clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; strong medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, firm, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common fine and very fine interstitial and tubular pores; common distinct brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent channers; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary. (6 to 10 inches thick) 

    Bk1--9 to 19 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) very channery loam, brown (7.5YR 5/2) moist; moderate medium and coarse prismatic structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine interstitial and tubular pores; 40 percent channers; disseminated lime, common fine masses and threads of lime; common distinct lime coatings on fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. (7 to 15 inches) 

    Bk2--19 to 27 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) very channery loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common very fine interstitial and tubular pores; 55 percent channers; disseminated lime, common fine masses of lime, common faint lime coatings on fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick)) 

    R--27 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) hard fractured shale.
