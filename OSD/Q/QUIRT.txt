QUIRT SERIES

The Quirt series consists of very deep, well drained soils on foothills and in basins.  These soils formed in residuum derived from shale.  Slopes are 4 to 35 percent.  Quirt soils have slow permeability.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:

There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - basins and foothills.
Elevation - 5650 to 7600 feet.
Slope - 4 to 35 percent.
Parent material - residuum derived from shale.
Climate -  Winters are moist and cool, summers are warm and dry.  A winter snowpack of 2 to 4 feet in depth and lasting through April is common.  
Mean annual temperature - 37 to 40 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation - 15 to 18 inches.
Frost free period - 30  to 75 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Nielsen and Tetonia series.  Nielson soils are on nearby windswept ridges.  They are less than 20 inches deep over hard bedrock.  Tetonia soils are on nearby summits.  They formed in local alluvium derived from loess, lack an argillic horizon and average less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained,  medium to rapid runoff, slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Quirt soils are used for livestock grazing, recreation and wildlife habitat.  These soils commonly support the mountain big sagebrush/Idaho fescue plant association.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho.  They are of small extent.
