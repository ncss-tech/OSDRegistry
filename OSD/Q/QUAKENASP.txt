QUAKENASP SERIES

The Quakenasp series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from limestone or interbedded shale and sandstone. These soils occur on hills. Slopes are 20 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 3.0 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic Vertic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Quakenasp loam, on woodland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oe--0 to 8 cm; moderately decomposed aspen leaves and twigs. (5 to 10 cm thick)

    A--8 to 34 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine, and common medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 8 percent subangular limestone gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (20 to 35 cm thick)

    Btk1--34 to 47 cm; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; moderately hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; 15 percent reddish brown (2.5YR 5/4) and 5 percent grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) mottles in the matrix; common fine, medium, and coarse roots; common very fine, and few fine and medium dendritic tubular pores; 15 percent prominent clay films on all faces of peds; 10 percent subangular limestone gravel; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.

    Btk2--47 to 82 cm; reddish brown (2.5YR 5/3) clay, reddish brown (2.5YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, firm, moderately sticky and very plastic; 5 percent light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) mottles in the matrix; common very fine and fine, and few medium roots; few very fine, fine and medium dendritic tubular pores; 20 percent faint clay films on all faces of peds; 4 percent medium distinct irregular carbonate masses in the matrix, and finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent ; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of Btk1, Btk2 horizons - 30 to 70 cm)

    C--82 to 200 cm; reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) clay, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) moist; massive; moderately hard, very firm, moderately sticky and very plastic; 10 percent light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) mottles in the matrix; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine dendritic tubular pores; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).
