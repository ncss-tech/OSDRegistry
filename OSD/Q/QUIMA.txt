QUIMA SERIES

The Quima series very deep well drained soils that formed from alluvium derived mainly from granitic rocks. Quima soils are on fan piedmonts. Slopes are O to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON: Quima coarse sandy loam - rangeland (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 5 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky, and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine tubular, and common very fine interstitial pores; moderate amount of mica flakes; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 8 cm thick)

    A2--5 to 13 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular and many very fine interstitial pores; moderate amount of mica flakes; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 18 cm thick)

    Bw--13 to 41 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; moderate amount of mica flakes; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (20 to 53 cm thick)

    Bk--41 to 152 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; moderate amount of mica flakes; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.O).

TYPE LOCATION: Nye County, Nevada; 3 miles northwest of Round Mountain, Nevada; 790 feet east and 265 feet north of the southwest corner of sec. 12, T.10N., R.43E.; USGS Round Mountain 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 44 minutes 1 seconds N and longitude 117 degrees 6 minutes 25 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.7336111 latitude, -117.1069444 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in some part for short periods during winter and early spring months and for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and September and October due to convection storms; typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 10 to 13 degrees C.
Depth to the Bk horizon: 30 to 75 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 5 to 12 percent.
Sand content: 25 percent coarse and very coarse sand and with moderate amounts of mica flakes. 
Rock fragments: 0 to 30 percent, dominantly granitic.

A horizons 
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4.
Structure: Weak very thin to medium platy structure or massive 
Reaction: Slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline.

Bw horizon 
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4.
Texture: Averages coarse sandy loam, but strata of fine sandy loam or sandy loam are in some pedons.
Structure: Massive but parts to weak coarse or medium subangular blocky or prismatic in some pedons.
Reaction: Slightly alkaline through strongly alkaline.

Bk horizon
Value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist,
Chroma: 3 through 5.
Texture: Averages coarse sandy loam, but strata of fine sandy loam or sandy loam are in some pedons.
Reaction: Slightly alkaline through strongly alkaline.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 5 percent.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Embudo, Hessing, Koyen, Monue, Unionville, and Wall series.  

Embudo soils have horizons with gravelly loamy coarse sand within 75 cm. Hessing soils have stratified very gravelly loamy coarse sand to extremely gravelly sand within 90 cm. Koyen soils have a calcium carbonate equivalent of 10 to 30 percent below the cambic horizon. Monue soils are calcareous throughout and lack mica flakes. Unionville soils are calcareous throughout and have a paralithic contact at depths of 50 to 70 cm. Wall soils have less than 25 percent coarse and very coarse sand and lack mica flakes in the particle size-control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Quima soils are on fan piedmonts at elevations of 5,500 to 6,500 feet.  Slopes are O to 4 percent.   The soils forced in alluvium derived mainly from granitic rocks. The climate is warm arid with a mean annual precipitation of 100 to 150 mm. The mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C and the frost-free season is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Broyles, Lathrop, Mazuma, and Stumble soils. Broyles soils have durinodes. Lathrop soils have argillic horizons and discontinuous weakly cemented horizons.  Mazuma soils are calcareous and lack cambic horizons. Stumble soils have sandy particle-size control sections

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well-drained; medium runoff; moderately rapid permeability; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wild life habitat. The vegetation is fourwing saltbush, Indian ricegrass, bud sagebrush thistle, and spiny hopsage.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Quima soils are moderately extensive in the Big Smoky Valley, Nye County, Nevada. MLRA 29.
