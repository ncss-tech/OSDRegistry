MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES PROPOSED: Somerset County, Maryland, 2002

REMARKS: Quindocqua soils were previously mapped as the Othello series.  Quindocqua soils are differentiated from Othello by having a particle-size control section that is fine-loamy rather than fine-silty. The name Quindocqua is a variant transliteration of an Algonquian (Native American tribe) word for Quantico (Qundoxua) which means "at the long inlet".

Data for this pedon, S02MD039-008, indicate that there is a change in particle size distribution between the Btg3 and 2Btg4 horizons (silt--52% to 35%; sand--24% to 46%; fine sand--14% to 27%). This indicates the change between eolian and fluviomarine depositional environments. The change in particle size distribution between the 2Btg4 and 2Cg1 horizons (silt--35% to 13%; sand--46% to 83%; fine sand--27% to 51%; clay--20% to 3.4%) is significant, but does not indicate a major difference in mode of transport. Although a loam texture, the 2Bt4 horizon is approaching fine sandy loam.

Some pedons have a 2Ab horizon that has textures similar to the 2C and 2Cg horizons.
	
Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 10 inches (Ap1, Ap2 and AE horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 10 to 31 inches (Btg1, Btg2, Btg3 and 2Btg4 horizons)
Aquic conditions--the soil has redox depletions and concentrations within all layers from the surface to 16 inches and have greater than 50% redoximorphic depletions with redox concentrations within the  upper 5 inches of the argillic horizon, with periodic saturation and reduction at some time during the year
Lithologic discontinuity at 23 inches (top of 2Btg4 horizon)
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches
