QUEEN SERIES

The Queen series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils on mountaintops, moutainsides and escarpments. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from limestone, carbonitic sandstone and eolian dust. Slope ranges from 1 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches. The mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Buckspring (WY), Hiddenforest ( NV), Montvale (UT), Motuqua (UT), Phizphre (AZ), Santa Fe (NM), and Slidymtn (NV) series. 
Slidymtn, Motoqua, Phizphre and Santa Fe soils have no secondary carbonates in the profile.  Slidymtn and Motoqua soils are formed in volcanic rocks, the Santa Fe and Hiddenforest soils formed in acid igneous rocks, and the Montvale soils in Sandstone.  The Slidymtn and Hiddenforest soils are in the ustic aridic soil moisture regime and the Montvale soils have a frost free season of only 105 to 140 days.  The Buckspring has a clay content in the particle size control section ranging from 15 to 25 percent.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Queen soils are located on mountain tops, mountain sides, summits of ridges and escarpments at an elevation ranging from 5000 to 7000 feet. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from limestone and carbonate sandstones and from additions of eolian dust. Slopes range from 1 to 70 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 60 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 21 inches. The frost-free period is 140 to 172 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Biduya and Lechuguilla series.  Biduya soils have no argillic horizon.  Lechuguilla soils are in the thermic soil temperature regime. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate to rapid runoff; saturated hydraulic conductivity ranges from 1-10 m/sec through the solum.

USE AND VEGETATION: Queen soils are used for recreation, grazing, firewood collecting and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation consists of curlyleaf muhly, hairy grama, sideoats grama, bull muhly, silver bluestem, plains lovegrass, wavyleaf oak, alligator juniper, beargrass, mountain mahogany, twoneedle pinon pine.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern New Mexico within MLRA 70C. This series is extensive..
