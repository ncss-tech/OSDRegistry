QUANDER SERIES

The Quander series consist of very deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from andesite, rhyolite, trachyte, breccia, or tuff.  These soils are toeslopes, footslopes, and backslopes of ridges and mountains.  Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Argicryolls

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section (smcs) is affected by precipitation that falls evenly throughout the year with the exception of a significant increase in July and August.  The soil moisture control section is usually dry in some part in early summer, moist in some or all parts in late July and August, and intermittently dry in fall; ustic regime, typic subclass.
Mean annual soil temperature: 36 to 44 degrees F.
Thickness of mollic epipedon: 10 to 15 inches

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bassel, Blaine, Bowen, Fingerrock, Fornor, Fourmile, Geertsen, Hoodle, Hungryhill, Lagarita, Lambe, Libeg, Nathale, Nathrop, Norriston, Ratiopeak, Spanpeak, and Woodhall series.
The Blaine, Bowen, Hungryhill, Nathale, Nathrop, and Woodhall soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact.
The Bassel and Geertsen are deep to a lithic or paralithic contact.
The Fingerrock soils have a sandy-skeletal substratum.
The Libeg soils do not have soil moisture control section that is usually moist in mid to late summer.
The Fourmile and Norriston soils have a lithologic discontinuity.
The Fornor, Hoodle, Lagarita, Lambe, and Ratiopeak soils have secondary accumulations of calcium carbonate.
The Spanpeak soils have an O horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: slope alluvium and colluvium derived from trachyte, andesite, rhyolite, breccia, or tuff

Mean annual temperature: 37 to 42 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 14 to 25 inches
Frost-free period: 50 to 80 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bushpark, Seitz, and Tellura soils. Bushpark soils are on shoulders and backslopes and have a lithic contact at less than 20 inches. Seitz soils are on backslopes and have more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Tellura soils are on backslopes and toeslopes and have more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: well drained; medium to very high runoff; moderate or moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for rangeland. Potential native vegetation is mountain muhly, prairie junegrass, blue grama, slimstem muhly, Thurber fescue, Parry oatgrass, Arizona fescue, and big bluegrass. It is in the Subalpine Loam Range Site, RS 250, or Skeletal Loam 377 Range Site.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwest Colorado in LRR E and MLRA 48A. The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Summit County, Colorado, 1974. The name is coined from Quandary Peak.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon.
Particle-size control section: the zone from 11 to 31 inches. (upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon)
Mollic epipedon: the zone from 0 to 11 inches. (A horizons)
Argillic horizon: the zone from 11 to 34 inches. (Bt horizons)

The central concept of parent material, landforms, and soil moisture regime for the Quander series was narrowed November 1999.  The type location was moved to the Cochetopa SSA in Saguache County, Colorado to better reflect the current concept  All pedons previously correlated to the Quander series will need to be reevaluated for compatibility with the revised Quander series.

The possibility of a Vitrandic subgroup needs to be investigated, particularly where this soil is derived from tuff and breccia bedrock.
