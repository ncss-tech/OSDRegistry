QUAY SERIES

The Quay series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in moderately fine to medium textured alluvium from red siltstone, shale, and sandstone deposits of the  Triassic, Permian, and Pennsylvanian ages.  These soils are on convex alluvial fans and footslopes.  Slope ranges from 0 to 9 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 15 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 60 degrees F.

Reakor series: is dry in the soil moisture control section for longer periods.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: formed in moderately fine to medium textured calcareous alluvium derived from red siltstone, shale, and sandstone from the Triassic, Permian, and Pennsylvanian ages.
Landform: on convex alluvial fans and footslopes.
Slopes: 0 to 9 percent.
Mean annual air temperature: 58 to 62 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 13 to 16 inches. 
Frost-free period: 180 to 190 days.

Thornthwaite annual P-E Index Values: 20 to 25.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alama, Glenrio, Ima, La Lande, and Tucumcari series. 
Alama soils are on slightly higher landscape positions and do not have a calcic horizon within 40 inches of the soil surface.
Glenrio soils are on similar landscape positions and have less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.
Ima soils are on higher landscape positions and have 18 percent or less clay in the particle-size control section.
La Lande soils are on slightly higher landscape positions and contain more than 15 percent fine and coarser sand.
Tucumcari soils are on similar landscape positions and have an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained.  Moderate permeability.  Surface runoff is negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes, very low on 1 to 3 percent slopes, low on 3 to 5 percent slopes, and medium on 5 to 9 percent slopes. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Principal use is rangeland but some areas are cultivated under irrigation.  Native vegetation is blue grama, western wheatgrass, black grama, galleta, sideoats grama, buffalograss, sand dropseed, three-awn, wolftail, and broom snakeweed.  Associated species are silver bluestem, vine-mesquite, ring muhly, fringed sagewort, and winterfat.  This series has been correlated to the Loamy (070EY663TX) range site in MLRA-77.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern New Mexico and western Texas (sub-MLRA-70E and 77E);  The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Quay County, New Mexico (Canadian River SCD Survey), 1940.

REMARKS: The calcic (Bk) horizon is in layers that appear to have once been part of an argillic horizon.  Evidence of illuviated clay can be found, but is insufficient for an argillic horizon.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 9 inches.  (A horizons)
Cambic horizon: 9 to 19 inches.  (Bw horizons) 
Calcic horizon: 19 to 36 inches.  (Bk, BCk horizons)
