QUIRK SERIES

The Quirk series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on structural benches and dissected plateaus. Quirk soils are formed in mixed loess and volcanic ash overlying residual material derived from volcanic tuffs overlying basalt. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Vitrandic Palexerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Quirk ashy silt loam, woodland, on an 8 percent east - facing slope at an elevation of 3,850 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted. Andic soil material textures are apparent field textures)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.  Series with a similar Typic subgroup classification are the Bridgecreek, Coser, Deer Creek, Eoj, Goodington, Harkers, Lynnbow, Mohocken, Norcan and Rands series. The Bridgecreek, Coser, and Mohocken soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches and lack a vitrandic feature. The Deer Creek, Eoj, Goodington, Harkers, Lynnbow, Norcan and Rands soils are greater than 40 inches to bedrock. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Quirk soils occur on summits and backslopes of structural benches and dissected plateaus. Elevations are 3,600 to 4,600 feet. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The soil is formed in mixed loess and volcanic ash overlying residual material derived from volcanic tuffs overlying basalt. The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 17 to 24 inches. The mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 70 to 110 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Anatone, Bocker and Volstead. Anatone soils are on convex nonforested mountain side slopes and are 10 to 20 inches deep to bedrock. Bocker soils are on nonforested convex to planar ridge and benches and are 4 to 10 inches deep to bedrock. Volstead soil are on forested swales of benches and backslopes and are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for watershed, wildlife habitat, timber production, livestock grazing and recreation. The native vegetation is ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, common snowberry, rose, birchleaf spiraea, common yarrow, heartleaf arnica, longstalk clover, blueleaf strawberry, western hawkweed, red avens, silky lupine, pinegrass, Idaho fescue and mountain brome. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeast Oregon; MLRA 9 and 10. These soils are of limited extent.
