QUAZAR SERIES

The Quazar series consist of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium, slope alluvium, colluvium derived from volcanic rock.  These soils are on alluvial fans, pediments, fan remnants and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 2.2 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Typic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Quazar very stony loam, on a north facing 25 percent alluvial fan slope on rangeland at an elevation of 2,957 meters.  (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. When described on August 30, 1983, the soil was moist throughout.)

    A1--0 to 13 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very stony loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 15 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, 20 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.

    A2--13 to 25 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very stony loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak medium granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 15 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, 20 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of A1, A2 horizons - 25 to 38 cm)

    Bt--25 to 76 cm; pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) extremely cobbly clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; slightly hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (48 to 142 cm thick) 

    2C--76 to 168 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) extremely cobbly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 30 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles, 15 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.4). (0 to 95 cm thick)
