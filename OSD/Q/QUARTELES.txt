QUARTELES SERIES

The Quarteles series consists of somewhat excessively drained soils that are very shallow to interbedded sandstone and siltstone bedrock.  Quarteles soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from micaceous sandstone, siltstone, mudstone, and fanglomerate on backslopes of ridges and hills.  Slopes are 25 to 90 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic, shallow Ustic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Quarteles gravelly loam--on a convex backslope of a ridge sloping 65 percent to the southeast at 6,420 feet elevation--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described, the soil was dry throughout.)

    A--0 to 2 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) gravelly loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; weak thick platy structure parting to weak medium granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and common very fine roots; common very fine irregularly shaped pores; 25 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Canyon, Epping, Eslendo, Gerst, Picante, Redarrow, Remorris, Sandoval, Shingle, Simel, Taluce, Tassel, and Tesihim series.

None of the competing series have greater than 5 percent mica in the control section.

Simel soils have greater than 24 percent clay in the particle-size control section.
Tesihim soils have paralithic material of tuff.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Quarteles soils are on backslopes of ridges and hills.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from Tertiary micaceous sandstone, siltstone, mudstone, and fanglomerate.  Slopes are 25 to 90 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,400 to 6,900 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Koshare, Ojito, and El Rancho soils.  The miscellaneous land type Rock outcrop, is also associated with Quarteles.  Koshare soils are coarse-loamy, very deep, have cambic horizons, and occur on adjacent toeslopes.  Ojito soils are coarse-loamy, moderately deep, and occur on adjacent beveled summits, shoulders, and footslopes.  El Rancho soils are fine-silty, very deep, have cambic horizons, and occur on toeslopes of ridges and hills.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; very high surface runoff; moderate permeability in the soil and moderately slow permeability in the underlying bedrock.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Quarteles soils are used for limited urban development and livestock grazing, and for recreation.  The historic climax vegetation is mountain mahogany, sideoats grama, oak, blue grama, and Indian ricegrass.  The ecological site is Sandstone Hills(R036XB122NM)..

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Quarteles soils are of small extent on the southeastern Espanola Basin part of the Basin and Range province in northcentral New Mexico.  The MLRA is 36.
