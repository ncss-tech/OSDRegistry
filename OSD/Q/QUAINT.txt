QUAINT SERIES 

The Quaint series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium, slope alluvium and residuum derived from hard red sedimentary bedrock.  These soils are on ridges, scarp slopes, plateaus and sideslopes of hills.  Slopes are 2 to 55 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Quaint channery loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 5 inches; weak red (2.5YR 4/2) channery loam, dusky red (2.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine pores; 25 percent channers; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 7 inches thick) 

    Bk1--5 to 11 inches; weak red (10R 5/3) very channery loam, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; common very fine and fine pores; 5 percent flagstones, 35 percent channers; disseminated lime; few faint lime coatings on fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); clear wavy boundary. 

    Bk2--11 to 14 inches; weak red (10R 5/3) very channery loam, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine pores; 5 percent flagstones, 55 percent channers; disseminated lime; common distinct lime coatings on undersides of fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of Bk horizons is 7 to 14 inches) 

    R--14 inches; weak red (10R 5/3) fractured hard shale. 

TYPE LOCATION:  Jefferson County, Montana; 300 feet north and 1,200 feet west of the SE corner of sec. 13, T. 4 N., R. 2 W.

Elevation - 4,600 to 6,000 feet. 
Slope - 2 to 45 percent. 
Parent material - colluvium, slope alluvium and residuum derived from hard red sedimentary bedrock. 
Climate - long, cold winter; moist springs; warm summers.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Quaint soils are primarily used for rangeland.  The potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, needleandthread, Western wheatgrass, lupine, big sagebrush, and rubber rabbitbrush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Quaint soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana. MLRA 43B.
