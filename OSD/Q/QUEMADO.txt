QUEMADO SERIES

The Quemado series consists of soils that are shallow to a petrocalcic horizon. They are well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in gravelly loamy alluvium over highly calcareous materials. These nearly level to moderately sloping soils are on knobs of paleoterraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees (72 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 533 mm (21 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, hyperthermic, shallow Ustalfic Petrocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Quemado very gravelly sandy loam in rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 in); brown (7.5YR 4/4) very gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak granular structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; 50 percent rounded quartz, chert, sandstone, and igneous gravel; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (8 to 20 cm [3 to 8 in] thick)

    Bt--13 to 31 cm (5 to 12 in); reddish brown (5YR 4/4) very gravelly sandy loam; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; weak granular structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few faint clay films on surfaces of peds and coarse fragments; about 55 percent rounded gravel; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary. (13 to 31 cm [5 to 12 in] thick)

    Bkkm1--31 to 61 (12 to 24 in); pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) strongly cemented calcium carbonate, having few fractures; finely laminated and indurated in upper part; about 50 percent embedded rounded siliceous gravel; moderately alkaline; diffuse irregular boundary. (10 to 46 cm [4 to 18 in] thick)

    Bkkm2--61 to 203 cm (24 to 80 in) pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) weakly cemented calcium carbonate; massive; about 50 percent siliceous gravel; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in the same family.  Similar soils are the Grava (TX), Hollace (NV), Jimenez (TX), Mata (TX), Plaintank (AZ), Terino (NM), and Yologo (TX) series.
Grava, Jimenez, and Yologo soils: have mollic epipedons, in addition the Grava soils are clayey-skeletal
Hollace and Plaintank soils: are in the mesic soil temperature regime.
Mata soils: are deep to weathered shale bedrock and do not have a petrocalcic horizon.
Terino soils: are in the thermic soil temperature regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: gravelly loamy alluvium derived from the Uvalde Gravel.
Landform: knobs on paleoterraces.
Slope: 0 to 8 percent.
Mean annual air temperature: 21 to 23 degrees C (70 to 74 degrees F).
Mean annual precipitation: 432 to 635 mm (17 to 25 in).
Precipitation pattern: moist spring and fall months and dry summer and winter months.
Frost-free period: 260 to 360 days.
Elevation: 31 to 274 m (100 to 900 ft).
Thornthwaite annual P-E indices: 24 to 28.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Delmita, Jimenez, Olmos, and Zapata series. (This aridisol is currently associated with soils in the ustic/aridic soil moisture regime. Associated soils will be evaluated in the future to insure proper taxonomic placement. This section will be updated to reflect any changes that may occur.) 
Delmita soils: are in the fine-loamy family and are on similar positions
Jimenez and Olmos soils: have a mollic epipedon, no argillic horizons and are on lower positions
Zapata soils: are not gravelly, do not have an argillic horizons and are on lower positions

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderate above the very slowly permeable petrocalcic horizon.  Runoff is negligible on slopes less than 1 percent, low on 1 to 5 percent slopes, and medium on 5 to 8 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Vegetation is a sparse cover of red grama, hairy tridens, threeawn, and Hall's panicum, and woody shrubs including cenizo, catclaw acacia, pricklypear, and some cacti.  Ecological site is Gravelly Ridge 18-35 PZ (R083BY419TX).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Rio Grande Plain, Texas; LRR I, MLRA 83B. The series is of large extent.
