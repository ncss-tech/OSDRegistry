QUINLAN SERIES

The Quinlan series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately rapid to moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy residuum weathered from noncemented, calcareous sandstone bedrock of Permian age. These soils occur on nearly level to very steep interfluves and side slopes of hillslopes, ridges, and escarpments in the Central Rolling Red Plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 635 mm (25 in) and mean annual temperature is 16.1 degrees C (61 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic, shallow Typic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Quinlan loam, northeast-facing, convex, 9 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of about 534 m (1,751 feet).
     (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in); reddish brown (5YR 5/4) loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable; many fine roots; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.  Thickness of the A horizon is 10 to 30 cm (4 to 12 in)

    Bw--20 to 33 cm (8 to 13 in); red (2.5YR 4/6) loam, dark red (2.5YR 3/6) moist; weak medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable; many fine roots; less than 2 percent of 2 to 10 mm in diameter pararock fragments consisting of very weakly cemented sandstone; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.  Thickness of the Bw horizon is 5 to 30 cm (2 to 12 in)

    Cd--33 to 163 cm (13 to 64 in); red (2.5YR 5/6) noncemented, calcareous sandstone bedrock, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.
