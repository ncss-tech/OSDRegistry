COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this classification.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Drainage class: somewhat poorly
Parent material: ash influenced loess over glacial drift
Landform: depressions and moraines on till plains
Slopes: 0 to 15 percent
Mean annual temperature: 33 to 35 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 15 to 35 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cohoe, Spenard, and Whitsol soils. Cohoe and Whitsol soils are well drained and occur on moraines. Spenard soils are very poorly drained and occur on bogs.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained, low to medium runoff, saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the solum, moderately high to high in the loamy glacial drift and high to very high in the sandy glacial drift

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for forestry and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is Lutz spruce, bluejoint grass, willow, and alder.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 225 Cook Inlet Lowlands, South-central Alaska, The series is of small extent.
