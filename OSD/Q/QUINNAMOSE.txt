QUINNAMOSE SERIES

The Quinnamose series consists of deep, well drained soils on mountain and foothill slopes. They formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from granite and schist with minor amounts of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. Slope ranges from 10 to 60 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 28 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:

Cobbler soils:  are very deep

Greenbluff:  are very deep

Stapaloop soils:  are very deep

Enson soils:  are 20 to 40 inches deep to a densic contact 

Labuck soils:  are 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Quinnamose soils are on side slopes of mountains and foothills at elevations of 2,000 to 4,500 feet (610 to 1376 meters). They formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from granite and schist with minor amounts of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and warm, dry summers. Slopes are 10 to 60 percent. The average annual precipitation is 22 to 43 inches (559 to 1092 mm). The average annual temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F. The frost-free period is 90 to 130 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kramerhill, Kruse, Micapeak and Spokane soils. Kramerhill soils are mesic, deep to a paralithic contact, have fine-loamy argillic horizons, and are on convex backslopes of foothills. Kruse soils have fine-loamy argillic horizons, are very deep, and are on linear backslopes of foothills. Micapeak soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact and are on convex backslopes of foothills. Spokane soils are mesic, are moderately deep to a paralithic contact, and are on convex backslopes of foothills. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, wildlife habitat, watershed, homesites, and recreation. Potential natural vegetation is mainly grand fir, Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, and lodgepole pine, with an understory of mallow ninebark, creambush oceanspray, baldhip rose, pine reedgrass, Saskatoon serviceberry, common snowberry, white spirea, and low Oregon grape. This series is correlated to the ABGR/PHMA habitat type. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern Washington, and northern Idaho; MLRA43A. Series is moderately extensive. MLRAs 43A and 44A.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 12 inches (Oi, Oe, A and BA horizons) 
Cambic horizon - the zone from 12 to 51 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons) 
Vitrandic feature - the zone from 3 to 12 inches (A and BA horizons)
Paralithic contact - the zone beginning at 58 inches (2Cr horizon) 
Particle-size control section - the zone from 13 to 43 inches (part of the Bw1 and the Bw2 horizons) 
Depth to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral layer. 

This series has been reclassified (11/2006) from Coarse-loamy, isotic, frigid Vitrandic Dystroxerepts to Coarse-loamy, isotic, frigid Vitrandic Haploxerepts based on lab data collected in Spokane County, WA. 
Quinnamose soils should be further investigated to determine typical mineralogy (isotic vs. mixed).
