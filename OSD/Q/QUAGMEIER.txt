QUAGMEIER SERIES

The Quagmeier series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slow permeable soils that formed from alluvium derived from Claron Formation sandstone and limestone.  Quagmeier soils are on fan remnants, remnant stream terraces, with slopes of 2 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 15 inches and mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Calcidic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Quagmeier very stony sandy loam--rangeland. The surface is covered by 25 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles, and 15 percent stones.  

       A--0 to 6 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very stony sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4), moist; weak fine and medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; 15 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 15 percent stones; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0). (4 to 8 inches thick)

       Btk--6 to 12 inches; very stony clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common distinct clay films on ped faces; 15 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 15 percent stones; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1).  (4 to 8 inches thick)

       Bk1--12 to 23 inches; extremely stony loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4), moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; carbonates disseminated throughout, 30 percent carbonate coats on rock fragments, 5 percent carbonate coats on surfaces along pores; 25 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles, and 20 percent stones; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3). (8 to 14 inches thick)

       Bk2--23 to 30 inches; extremely stony loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4), moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 30 percent carbonate coats on rock fragments, 15 percent carbonate coats on surfaces along pores; 25 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles, and 30 percent stones; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4). (4 to 10 inches thick)

       Bk3--30 to 60 inches; extremely stony loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3), moist; massive; 30 percent carbonate coats on rock fragments 15 percent carbonate coats on surfaces along pores; 15 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles, and 35 percent stones; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5).

Chroma: 3 to 6, dry or moist
Texture: clay loam, loam
Clay content: 27 to 35 percent

Bk horizons
Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR
Value: 4 to 6, dry or moist
Chroma: 3 to 6, dry or moist
Texture: loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam
Clay content: 18 to 27 percent
Rock fragments: 35 to 75 percent gravel, cobbles, and stones 
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 20 to 40 percent

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Fangio (NM) and Tsezhin (AZ) series. The Fangio soils have paralithic contact a deep to very deep depths.  Tsezhin soils have a calcic horizon at 23 to 50 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: alluvium derived from Claron Formation sandstone and limestone
Landform: fan remnants and remnant stream terraces
Slopes: 2 to 35 percent
Elevation: 6,000 to 7,260 feet
Mean annual temperature: 45 to 51 degrees F 
Mean annual precipitation: 12 to 17 inches 
Frost-free period: 100 to 120 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Parkelei soils.  Parkelei soils have an argillic horizon, but have no calcic horizons and are not skeletal. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, very low to low runoff, moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are mainly used for rangeland, woodland, wildlife habitat and recreation. Potential native vegetation is two-needle pinyon, Utah juniper, Gambel's oak, Utah serviceberry, mountain big sagebrush, Indian ricegrass and muttongrass.  This soil has been correlated to the Upland Stony Loam (Pinyon - Utah Juniper) 035XX321UT ecological site at the type location in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Utah included in the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument soil survey; this series is of limited extent; MLRA35.
