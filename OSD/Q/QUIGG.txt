QUIGG SERIES

The Quigg series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on high stream terraces and alluvial fans. Slopes are 2 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive Abruptic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Quigg loam, in rangeland  (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 7 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 9 inches thick)

    E/Bt--7 to 17 inches; E part (85 percent): light gray (10YR 7/2) sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; Bt part (15 percent): light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (2 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt--17 to 29 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy clay, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; strong very coarse columnar structure; extremely hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common tongues of light gray (2.5Y 7/2),light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) moist albic material on upper vertical faces of peds;  continuous prominant yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist clay films on faces of peds; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual wavy boundary. (8 to 13 inches thick)

    BC--29 to 38 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate coarse platy structure; extremely hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine interstitial pores; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 20 inches thick)

    C1--38 to 45 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) silty clay, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; strong coarse platy structure; extremely hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine pores; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual wavy boundary.

    C2--45 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) silty clay, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; strong coarse platy structure; extremely hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine interstitial pores; slightly acid (ph 6.2).
