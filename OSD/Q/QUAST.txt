QUAST SERIES

The Quast series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in material derived from eolian deposits and alluvium, outwash or colluvium. These soils are on fan remnants, eroded fan remnants, outwash terraces, and hills. Slopes are 2 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Quast silt loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 30 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (25 to 38 cm thick) 

    Bw1--30 to 64 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual smooth boundary.

    Bw2--64 to 89 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very fine sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (combined thickness of Bw horizons is 15 to 75 cm) 

    Bk--89 to 114 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; finely disseminated carbonates and common fine carbonate masses; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (14 to 38 cm thick) 

    BCk--114 to 152 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) fine sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; finely disseminated carbonates and common fine carbonate masses; prominent carbonate coats on the bottom surfaces of rock fragments; 5 percent gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).
