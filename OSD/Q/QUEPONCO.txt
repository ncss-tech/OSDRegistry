Where wooded--upper story species include white oak (Qercus alba), American holly (Ilex opaca), sweet gum (Liquidambar styraciflua), loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), pignut hickory (Carya glabra), sassafras (Sassafras albidum), Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Distribution: MLRA 153D Northern Tidewater area of Maryland, and possible Delaware
Extent: The series is small; 5,000 to 10,000 acres

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES PROPOSED: Somerset County, Maryland, 2000.

REMARKS: Queponco soils were previously mapped with the Matapeake series. Queponco soils are differentiated from Matapeake by having a particle-size control section that is fine-loamy rather than fine-silty and having a seasonal water table between 40 and 72 inches.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 10 inches (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 10 to 31 inches (Bt horizon)

Other soil features identified in this pedon:
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches

ADDITIONAL DATA: This pedon sampled as S00MD039-005. Additional reference samples include sample numbers S99MD039-046-1, 3,4 and 5 (University of Maryland, College Park, MD).

Data Mapunit ID: To be developed.
