SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA
Major Uses: Mostly woodland. Areas once farmed have now been abandoned.
Dominate Vegetation: Pitch pine, shortleaf pine, black, and white oak, with an understory of lowbush blueberries and scrub oak.  Where wildfires have been severe, pitch pine and black jack oak are dominant.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Distribution: The Northern Atlantic Coastal Plain of New Jersey
Extent: Moderate

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES PROPOSED: Gloucester County, New Jersey, 1999

REMARKS: The Quakerbridge series was formally mapped in New Jersey with the Lakewood series, most often in areas adjacent to poorly or very poorly drained soils such as Atsion sand and Manahawkin muck. However, Lakewood soils have a seasonal high water table greater than 72 inches. Quakerbridge soils typically have a Bh horizon less than 4 inches thick or if the horizon is more than 4 inches, it fails either the physical or chemical properties defined for spodic materials.

Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 3 inches (A horizon)
Albic horizon--the zone from 3 to 20 inches (E horizon)
Aquic conditions--the zone from 42 to 80 inches (C1, C2 horizons) is periodically saturated (episaturation)
