QUIMERA SERIES

The Quimera series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from interbedded sandstone and shale.  Quimera soils are on hillslopes.  Slopes are l5 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 432 mm.  The mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid Lithic Ustorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Quimera very channery clay loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     A--0 to 8 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very channery clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine discontinuous pores; 55 percent channers; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 8 cm thick)

     Bw--8 to 23 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few medium, fine and very fine roots; common very fine continuous tubular pores; 5 percent channers; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 15 cm thick)

     BC--23 to 38 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few medium and fine roots; common very fine continuous tubular pores; 10 percent channers; strongly effervescent with disseminated calcium carbonates; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 15 cm thick)

     C--38 to 43 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; massive; hard, firm, very sticky and moderately plastic; few medium and fine roots; few very fine continuous tubular pores; strongly effervescent with disseminated calcium carbonates; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 10 cm thick)

     2R--43 cm; hard calcareous sandstone and interbedded shale.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, l989.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Cambic horizon:  8 to 23 cm (Bw horizon)
Lithic contact:  43 cm to hard calcareous sandstone and/or shale bedrock (R layer)

This soil is an Entisol because the base of the cambic is above a depth of 25 cm.

Quimera soils have a frigid temperature regime and are in an ustic soil moisture regime with a typic subclass.
