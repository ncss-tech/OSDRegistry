QUANAH SERIES

The Quanah series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy calcareous slope alluvium and/or colluvium of Permian age. These soils occur on nearly level to gently sloping base slopes and side slopes of hillslopes.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 610 to 660 mm (24 to 26 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 16.7 degrees C (62 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Quanah silty clay loam--rangeland.

Nuvalde and Angelo soils: allow clay or silty clay textures in the particle-size control section and formed in alluvial sediments on stream terraces
Aspermont and Burford soils: are deep (102 to 152 cm) to densic bedrock and do not have a mollic epipedon
Jaywi soils: do not have a mollic epipedon
Lutie soils: have an argillic horizon
Oakley soils: are fine-loamy in the particle-size control section and formed in alluvial terrace sediments

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: calcareous loamy slope alluvium and/or colluvium derived from gypsum, limestone, and mudstone of the Blaine Formation of Permian age.
Landscape: dissected plains
Landform: base slopes and side slopes on hillslopes
Slope: dominantly 0 to 3 percent, but range up to 5 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 559 to 686 mm (22 to 27 in)

Aspermont soils: occur on similar to slightly higher positions
Jaywi soils: occur on more sloping areas
Nipsum soils: have a mollic epipedon more than 50 cm (20 in) thick and occur on lower positions
Talpa soils: are less than 50 cm (20 in) deep to dolomitic limestone and occur on higher positions
Tilvern, Vernon, and Westill soils: have more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Tilvern and Vernon occur on similar to higher positions and Westill soils occur on similar to lower positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderate. Runoff is negligible on slopes less than 1 percent, low on 1 to 5 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mostly as rangeland, but some areas are cultivated with wheat, sorghums, and cotton the principal crops. Native vegetation is sideoats grama, buffalograss, blue grama, vine-mesquite, and mesquite trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North central Texas and southwestern Oklahoma; Land Resource Region - H; MLRAs 78B and 78C (Central Rolling Red Plains). This series is of moderate extent.
