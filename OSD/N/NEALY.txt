NEALY SERIES

The Nealy series consists of moderately deep to hardpan, well drained soils on fan terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium from mixed igneous and metamorphic rocks.  Slopes range from 1 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Argidurids

TYPICAL PEDON: Nealy gravelly coarse sandy loam on an east facing slope - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).  About 30 percent of the soil surface is covered with gravel.

    A--0 to 2 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak thin platy structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 30 percent gravel; strongly effervescent, 7 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick)

    Bw--2 to 14 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; few very fine interstitial pores; 22 percent angular gravel; strongly effervescent, 7 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 14 inches thick)

    Btk--14 to 33 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, sticky and plastic; common fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 25 percent angular gravel; few faint clay films in pores and on ped faces; violently effervescent, 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent as many fine soft seams, masses and filaments; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (15 to 21 inches thick)

    Bkqm--33 to 48 inches; indurated, silica and lime cemented hardpan.

    2C--48 to 60 inches; extremely gravelly sand.

TYPE LOCATION:  Mohave County, Arizona; 9 miles southwest of Dolan Springs;  35 degrees, 28 minutes, 33 seconds North latitude, 114 degrees, 26 minutes, 55 seconds West longitude; about 50 feet west and 100 feet north of the southeast corner of section 7, T.24 N., R.20 W. Gila and Salt River Base Meridian.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture: Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during December  February and for less than 20 days cumulative during July - September.  Driest during May and June.  Typic aridic soil moisture regime.

Soil temperature:  61 to 66 degrees F.

Rock fragments: 10 to 35 percent gravel.  A surface layer containing 10 to 70 percent gravel is common.

Depth to duripan: 20 to 40 inches

Thickness of duripan: 6 to 30 inches

Depth to unconsolidated alluvium: 26 to 60 inches

Reaction: slightly to moderately alkaline

Calcium carbonate: slightly effervescent to strongly effervescent in the subsurface layer; strongly to violently effervescent in the calcic.  15 to 25 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.

Clay content: Averages 20 to 35 percent in the control section


A horizon

Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR

Value: 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist

Chroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist


Bw and Btk horizons

Hue: 7.5YR, 5YR

Value: 4 or 5 dry, 3, 4, or 5 moist

Chroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cuddeback (CA), Luckyfuse (CA), and Tenwell (NV) series.  Cuddeback soils are continuously dry in the soil moisture control section from April through October.  Luckyfuse and Tenwell series do not have calcic horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nealy soils are on fan terraces at elevations of 3,000 to 4,300 feet.  Slopes range from 1 to 10 percent.  They formed in mixed alluvium from igneous and metamorphic rocks.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 200 to 230 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Shorim and Vado soils.  Shorim soils do not have an argillic above the hardpan.  Vado soils are very deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Nealy soils are used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  Vegetation is blackbrush, creosotebush, Mohave yucca, rayless goldenhead, big galleta, and desert needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Arizona.  This series is of moderate extent.  MLRA is 30.
