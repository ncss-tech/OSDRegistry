COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cohoe, Kenai, Mutnala, and Whitsol series. Cohoe soils have less than 15 percent fine sands and coarser in the upper 40 inches of the soil profile. Kenai soils have greater than 20 percent clay in the substratum. Mutnala soils have greater than 6 percent total carbon in the spodic horizon. Whitsol soils have loess thickness is greater than 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Drainage class: well drained
Parent material: ash influenced loess over gravelly drift
Landform: moraines and till plains
Slopes: 0 to 60 percent
Mean annual temperature: 33 to 36 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 16 to 28 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Cohoe, Soldotna, Slikok, and Tuxedni series. Cohoe and Soldotna soils are well drained and occur on similar landforms. Slikok soils are very poorly drained and occur on depressions. Tuxdeni soils are somewhat poorly drained and occur on similar landforms.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, low to high runoff, saturated hydraulic conductivity is high is the solum and moderately high to high in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat, timber production, and recreation. The native vegetation is white spruce, paper birch, oakfern, and dogwood.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 224 Cook Inlet Lowland, South-central Alaska, The series is of moderate extent.
