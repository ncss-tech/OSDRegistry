NUVALDE SERIES

The Nuvalde series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous silty and clayey alluvium derived from limestone.  These soils occur on nearly level to gently sloping stream terraces and alluvial fans.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Frio, Kavett, Mereta, Reap, Salga, and Tarrant series. 
Frio soils: occur on lower flood plains and do not have calcic horizons.
Kavett soils: occur on higher positions and are shallow to a petrocalcic and lithic contact.
Mereta soils: occur on slightly higher positions and are shallow to a petrocalcic horizon.
Reap soils: occur on similar to slightly lower positions and have more than 40 percent silicate clay content in the particle-size control section and have vertic properties.
Salga soils: occur on similar positions, have more than 35 percent silicate clay content in the particle-size control section and have an argillic horizon.
Tarrant soils: occur on higher positions and are shallow to lithic limestone bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is  moderately slow in the upper part and moderately slow or moderate in the lower part. Runoff is low on 0 to 1 percent slopes and medium on 1 to 5 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major uses are crop production and livestock grazing.  Cultivated crops include oats, wheat, cotton, and sorghums.  Native vegetation is mostly sideoats grama, silver bluestem, vine-mesquite, buffalograss, condalia, and forbs.
