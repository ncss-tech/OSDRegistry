REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features in this pedon
*Particle-size control section--zone from 27 to 102 cm
*Ochric epipedon
The A/E and AC horizons do not meet the organic carbon content required for an umbric epipedon when mixed to a depth of 18 cm.
Inclusions of albic materials with high value, low chroma colors may be present in A/E horizons.
