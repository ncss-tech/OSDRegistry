NEWAYGO SERIES

The Newaygo series consists of very deep, well drained soils that are moderately deep to stratified sand and gravel. The Newaygo soils formed in loamy materials and are on outwash plains, terraces, and valley trains. Slope ranges from 0 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 7.2 degrees C (45 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, semiactive, frigid Alfic Haplorthods

TYPICAL PEDON: Newaygo sandy loam, on a 3 percent slope in a cultivated field on an outwash plain. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 18 cm (7 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) sandy loam; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak medium granular structure; friable; numerous roots; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [15 to 23 cm (6 to 9 inches) thick]

 Bs--18 to 46 cm (7 to 18 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) sandy loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. [15 to 41 cm (6 to 16 inches) thick]

 B/E--46 to 76 cm (18 to 30 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay loam (Bt); thick ped coatings and worm and root cast fillings of grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy loam (E); moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots; about 5 percent gravel; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. [15 to 41 cm (6 to 16 inches) thick]

 Bt--76 to 86 cm (30 to 34 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/2) gravelly clay loam; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; about 15 percent gravel; neutral; abrupt irregular boundary. [5 to 20 cm (2 to 8 inches) thick]

 2C--86 to 152 cm (34 to 60 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) stratified gravel, gravelly sand, and sand; single grain; loose; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Newaygo soils are on outwash plains, terraces, and valley trains. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. These soils formed in loamy materials. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 813 mm (28 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 5.6 to 7.2 degrees C (42 to 45 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the somewhat excessively drained sandy Karlin and Mancelona soils which are nearby on similar landforms.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to high depending upon slope. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and very high in the substratum. Permeability is moderate in the solum and very rapid in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: A large part is cropped to small grains, corn, beans, and legume-grass hay; some is cropped to vegetables. A small part is in permanent pasture or is forested. Native vegetation is chiefly sugar maple, American elm, yellow birch, and some eastern white pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 94A, 96, and 98 in central and northern Michigan. This series is of moderate extent.
