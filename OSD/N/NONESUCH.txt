NONESUCH SERIES

The Nonesuch series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy till overlying sedimentary bedrock on ground moraines and post glacial lake shorelines.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderate in the solum, very slow in the fragipan and moderately slow in the substratum.  Slopes range from 1 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 810 millimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same taxonomic family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Mean annual precipitation - 760 to 860 millimeters
Mean annual air temperature - 4 to 7 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Big Iron, Croswell, Flintsteel, Greenstone, and Loggerhead soils.
Big Iron - are on adjacent rises, greater than 203 centimeters deep to bedrock, and in the Aquic Glossudalfs Subgroup
Croswell  are on adjacent beach ridges, greater than 152 centimeters deep to bedrock, and in the Oxyaquic Haplorthods Subgroup
Flintsteel  are on adjacent interfluves and side slopes, greater than 203 centimeters deep to bedrock, and in the Oxyaquic Glossudalfs Subgroup.
Greenstone  are lower on the landscape, 25 to 50 centimeters deep to paralithic material, 50 to 152 centimeters deep to bedrock, and in the Fragiaquic Hapludalfs Subgroup.
Loggerhead  are on adjacent knolls, rises, and side slopes, greater than 203 centimeters deep to bedrock, and in the Oxyaquic Haplorthods Subgroup.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage - Internal drainage is impeded by the bedrock.  A seasonal zone of water saturation ranges from a depth of 46 to 91 centimeters and is perched on the siltstone bedrock.  It is highest in spring after snow melt and also occurs for short periods from October to May (moderately well drained).
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Crt horizon) - moderately slow
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (B/Ex horizon) - very slow
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (all other horizons) - moderate

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are forested.  The major species are sugar maple, red maple, quaking aspen, and green ash.  A few areas are used for pasture and hay production or are idle.

The series is of small extent;  3282 hectares are correlated.
