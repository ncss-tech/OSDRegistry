NORKA SERIES

The Norka series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in thick, calcareous, eolian or alluvial materials high in very fine sand.  Norka soils are on hills, ridges, slope breaks and valley sideslopes and have slopes of 0 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 41 centimeters (16 inches). Mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C. (48 degrees F.)

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Norka loam, grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

  A--0 to 10 centimeters (0 to 4 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 18 centimeters (3 to 7 inches) thick)

  BA--10 to 18 centimeters (4 to 7 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to medium subangular blocks; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; thin glossy coatings on faces of peds, and discontinuous glossy coatings in some root channels and pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 10 centimeters (0 to 4 inches) thick)

  Bt--18 to 33 centimeters (7 to 13 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) light silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to medium subangular blocks; hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; thin continuous clay films on faces of peds and in root channels and pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (13 to 30 centimeters (5 to 12 inches) thick)

  Bk1--33 to 41 centimeters (13 to 16 inches); pale yellow (2.5Y 7/3) silt loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few thin glossy coatings on faces of peds, and discontinuous glossy coatings in root channels and pores; visible secondary calcium carbonate as concretions and in thin seams and streaks; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 13 centimeters (0 to 5 inches) thick)

  Bk2--41 to 152 centimeters (16 to 60 inches); pale yellow (2.5Y 7/3) silt loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; massive; hard, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; visible secondary calcium carbonate as concretions and in thin seams and streaks; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Aliante, Alliance, Cale, Calemore, Hugoton, Kadoka, Keith, Norka, Thirtynine and Vale series. 
Aliante soils are dryer in the soil moisture control section. 
Alliance and Kadoka soils have the base of the argillic horizon deeper than 38 centimeters (15 inches).
Kadoka soils have a significant component of volcanic ash.  
Cale and Kadoka soils have soft bedrock above 102 centimeters (40 inches).  
Calemore and Keith soils have an argillic horizon below a depth of 38 centimeters (15 inches).  
Hugoton soils have an argillic horizon from 20 to 175 centimeters (8 to 69 inches).
Thirtynine soils have lower soiul temperature. 
Vale soils have hue of 5YR or redder and have thicker solums.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform: hillsand plains
Lanfscape: ridges, slope breaks, and valley sideslopes
Slopes: 0 to 12 percent
Parent material: thick, calcareous, eolian or alluvial materials often containing a large proportion of very fine sand
Mean annual precipitation: 33 to 46 centimeters (13 to 18 inches), peak precipitation occurring in the spring and early summer months  
Mean annual temperature: 9 degrees C. (48 degrees F.) 
Mean summer temperature: 21 degrees C. (70 degrees F.)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Colby soils and the competing Keith soils.  
Colby soils lack a mollic epipedon or an argillic horizon.
