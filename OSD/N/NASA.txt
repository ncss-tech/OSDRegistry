NASA SERIES

The Nasa series consists of moderately deep to petrogypsic, well drained soils that formed in coarse-loamy gypsiferous eolian deposits. These gently sloping soils are on fan piedmonts, playa steps, and relict lakebeds. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Hermes series.  Hermes soils have less than 8 percent clay in the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nasa soil are on fan piedmonts, playa steps, and relict lakebeds. Slope is 0 to 6 percent. These soils formed from coarse-loamy gypsiferous eolian deposits. Elevation ranges from 3,960 to 4,820 ft. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. Precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September. The mean annual air temperature is 64 to 70 degrees F. The frost-free period is 180 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bomber, Corvus, Matador, Tornado and Yesum soils. Bomber soils do not have a petrogypsic horizon and are in drainages. Corvus soils have petrogypsic horizons between 5 and 20 inches and are on relict dunes and fan piedmonts. Matador soils have salic horizons and are in drainages. Tornado soils are greater than 40 percent clay in the particle size control section, have mixed mineralogy and are in drainages. Yesum soils have gypsic horizons within 7 inches from the surface (Leptic) and are on fan piedmonts.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low runoff; moderate to rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: The major uses are military exercises and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is bush muhly, black grama, creosotebush, plains bristlegrass, and mariola. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South central New Mexico, limited to the Tularosa Basin and surrounding piedmonts. MLRA 42-2. Limited extent.
