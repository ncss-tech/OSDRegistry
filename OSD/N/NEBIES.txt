NEBIES SERIES

The Nebies series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly alluvium or gravelly till derived from igneous and/or metamorphic rock. These soils are on moraines, stream terraces, knobs or hills in intermountain valleys. Slopes are 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcidic Argiustolls

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Beaverell, Beavwan, Kremlin, Sixbeacon, Trimad and Vendome soils.  The Beaverell soils have a sandy-skeletal substratum at depths of 10 to 20 inches and are on similar landform positions.  The Beavwan soils are fine-loamy and are on similar landform positions.  The Kremlin soils are fine-loamy and are on slightly higher convex to linear positions on the landform.  Sixbeacon and Trimad soils do not have argillic horizons and are on slightly higher convex to linear positions on the landform.  Vendome soils are sandy-skeletal and are on slightly higher convex to linear positions on the landform.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate permeability in the upper part (A, Bt and Bk1 horizons) and moderately rapid permeability in the lower part (Bk2 and Bk3 horizons).

USE AND VEGETATION: Nebies soils are used mainly for rangeland and cropland. Potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, western wheatgrass, needleandthread, prairie Junegrass, thickspike wheatgrass, green needlegrass and blue grama.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Nebies soils are of small extent in the intermountain valleys of southwestern Montana. MLRA 44.
