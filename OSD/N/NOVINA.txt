NOVINA SERIES

The Novina series consists of very deep moderately well drained soils.  They formed in loamy and sandy alluvium on flood plains and stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 11 degrees C. (51 degrees F.), and mean annual precipitation is 64 centimeters (25 inches) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Fluvaquentic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Novina sandy loam with a slope of less than 1 percent in an irrigated field.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)  When described the soil was moist throughout. 

  Ap--0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches); dark gray (10YR 4/1) sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.

  A--18 to 48 centimeters (7 to 19 inches); gray (10YR 5/1) sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (Combined A horizon is 25 to 51 centimeters (10 to 20 inches) thick)

  AC--48 to 66 centimeters (19 to 26 inches); gray (10YR 5/1) sandy loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (13 to 20 centimeters (5 to 8 inches) thick)

  C1--66 to 84 centimeters (26 to 33 inches); light gray (2.5Y 7/2) loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; few fine distinct reddish brown (5YR 5/3) moist iron masses in the matrix; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.

  C2--84 to 97 centimeters (33 to 38 inches); light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; few fine faint reddish brown (5YR 5/3) moist iron masses in the matrix; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.

  C3--97 to 107 centimeters (38 to 42 inches); light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.

  C4--107 to 127 centimeters (42 to 50 inches); grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) sandy loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; few fine distinct reddish brown (5YR 5/3) moist iron masses in the matrix; massive; hard, friable; slight effervescence; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

  C5--127 to 203 centimeters (50 to 80 inches); pale yellow (2.5Y 8/2) loam, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Merrick County, Nebraska; about 1.2 kilometers (3/4 mile) west of Silver Creek; 402 meters (1,320 feet) west and 30 meters (100 feet) north of southeast corner, sec. 29, T. 16 N., R. 3 W.

A horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 3 to 5, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 1 or 2 dry or moist
Texture: typically sandy loam or fine sandy loam and ranges to loam  
Reaction: moderately acid to neutral

AC horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 4 to 6, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 1 or 2 dry or moist
Texture: typically sandy loam, ranging to loam and fine sandy loam
Reaction: slightly acid or neutral

C horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 5 to 8, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 1 or 2 dry or moist
Texture: typically loam or sandy loam
Strata that range from loamy fine sand to silty clay loam are in the C horizon of some pedons.  
Reaction: neutral to moderately alkaline, though some pedons are strongly alkaline in the lower part
Iron masses: few to many, faint or distinct, with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6 moist

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Marksbutte, Ovina, and Wann Series. 
MarksButte soils have coarse sand and gravelly sand above 100 centimeters (40 inches.)
Ovina soils are calcareous throughout.
Wann soils contain more fine and coarser sand in the control section, are calcareous at or near the surface, and are somewhat poorly drained

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Lamdform: bottom land and low stream terraces of major stream valleys
Parent material: recent alluvial sediments
Slope: 0 to 2 percent
Climate: subhumid
Mean annual precipitation: 61 to 76 centimeters (24 to 30 inches)
Mean annual temperature: 9 to 11 degrees C. (48 to 52 degrees F.)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Alda, Fonner, Merrick, Leshara, Ovina, and Wann soils. 
Alda and Fonner soils have gravelly sand in the lower part of the control section.
Merrick soils are fine-loamy.  
Leshara and Gibbon soils are more poorly drained and are fine-silty.
Ovina soils are calcareous throughout.  
Wann soils contain more, finer and coarser sand in the control section, are calcareous at or near the surface, and are somewhat poorly drained.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage: moderately well drained  
Runoff: low
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: moderately high  
Seasonal high water table: 91 to 183 centimeters (3 to 6 feet)
Flooding: rarely 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are cultivated.  
Corn, alfalfa, and grain sorghum are the principal dryland crops.  
Many areas are irrigated, and the principal crop is corn.  
The remaining acreage is in native grass and used for grazing or mowed for hay.
Native vegetation is principally big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, and Indiangrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central and eastern Nebraska.  Novina soils are not extensive.
