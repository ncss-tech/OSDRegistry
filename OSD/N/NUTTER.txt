NUTTER SERIES

The Nutter series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and alluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary formations with high lime and gypsum content.  Nutter soils are on colluvial slopes and terraces and have slopes of 1 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, gypsic, mesic Typic Calcigypsids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Nutter very gravelly loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(1 to 3 inches thick)

    Bk--2 to 13 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common fine and very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 35 percent gravel; violently effervescent, segregated as few fine irregular calcium carbonate masses, seams and coatings on rock fragments, 27 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.

(6 to 15 inches thick)

    By1--23 to 38 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/4) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and common fine roots; common fine and very fine tubular pores; 50 percent gravel; strongly effervescent, disseminated, 31 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 55 percent crystalline gypsum occurring as sand grains and pendants on rock fragments; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 15 inches thick)

    By2--38 to 47 inches; reddish yellow (7.5YR 8/6) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; few fine and very fine tubular pores; 45 percent gravel; strongly effervescent, disseminated, 30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 35 percent crystalline gypsum occurring as sand grains and pendants on rock fragments; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nutter soils are on colluvial and alluvial slopes and terraces and have slopes of 1 to 20 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium and alluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary formations with high lime and gypsum content.  Elevation ranges from 4000 to 5000 feet.  Mean annual precipitation is 7 to 11 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 53 to 57 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 165 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Gyppocket, Dutchman, Goblin, McCullan and Robroost soils.  Dutchman, McCullan and Robroost soils average less than 35 percent rock fragments.  Goblin soils have bedrock at depths less than 20 inches.  Gyppocket soils are sandy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; slow to medium runoff;  moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Nutter soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is black grama, gyp dropseed, galleta, Indian ricegrass, Mormon-tea, wolfberry and broom snakeweed.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Arizona.  This series is of small extent. MLRA 35.
