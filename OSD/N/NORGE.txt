NORGE SERIES

The Norge series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable upland soils that formed in loamy alluvium of Pleistocene age. These nearly level to sloping soils occur on flats and upper side slopes of upland terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature is 16.1 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 864 mm (34 in). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, active, thermic Udic Paleustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Norge silt loam, southeast-facing, linear convex, 2 percent slope in cropland at an elevation of 287 m (940 ft).   (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    BA--30 to 46 cm (12 to 18 in); reddish brown (5YR 4/3) silty clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium granular structure; hard, friable; many fine roots; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary. (Thickness of the BA horizon is 0 to 25 cm [0 to 10 in]) 

    Bt1--46 to 91 cm (18 to 36 in); reddish brown (5YR 5/4) silty clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm; common fine roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary. 

     Bt2--91 to 122 cm (36 to 48 in); red (2.5YR 5/6) silty clay loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm; common fine roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary. 

    Bt3--122 to 167 cm (48 to 66 in); red (2.5YR 5/8) silty clay loam, red (2.5YR 4/8) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; few fine roots; few distinct clay films on faces of peds; slightly acid. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 23 to 130 cm [9 to 51 in])
