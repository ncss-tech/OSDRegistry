NORTHBEAR SERIES

The Northbear series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from sandstone and mudstone. Northbear soils are on mountains and have slopes of 5 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1520 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, isomesic Typic Humustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Northbear loam; on a northeast facing convex slope of 22 percent under Douglas-fir, grand fir, California laurel, and tanoak. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.) When described on June 7, 2007, the soil was moist throughout.

TYPE LOCATION: Humboldt County, California; USGS Taylor Peak Quadrangle; WGS84 Decimal degrees 40.4916667 latitude and -124.2322222 longitude; Zone 10 UTM 395566mE, 4483062mN; NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section is dry in some or all parts for 90 or more cumulative days in normal years and moist in some part for 180 cumulative days per year or for 90 or more consecutive days. The soils have an ustic moisture regime.

Soil Temperature: The mean annual soil temperature at 50 centimeters is 9 to 11 degrees C. The difference between mean summer and winter temperature is less than 6 degrees C.

Umbric Epipedon: 50 to 100 centimeters thick

Surface Fragments: 0 to 5 percent gravel

Rock fragments: 2 to 34 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent cobbles
Clay content: 18 to 26 percent 

A horizons:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 3 to 5, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4, 1 to 3 moist
Texture of fine earth: loam
Clay content: 16 to 24 percent
Rock fragments: 0 to 34 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent cobbles

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Biaggi and Gschwend series. Biaggi soils have a lithic contact between 50 and 100 centimeters and occur on marine terraces. Gschwend soils are formed in alluvium and occur on river terraces.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Northbear soils are on linear to slightly convex and concave summit, shoulder, and backslope positions on ridges and mountain slopes. Slopes are 5 to 75 percent. Elevations are 5 to 855 meters. These soils formed in colluvium from strongly cemented sandstone and mudstone. Mean annual precipitation is 1140 to 2280 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C. Frost free season is about 240 to 330 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Caperidge (T) and Taylorpeak (T) soils. Caperidge have greater than 35 percent gravel in the particle size control section and are on to slightly concave to slightly convex shoulder and backslope positions. Taylorpeak soils have bedrock with cracks closer than 10 centimeters between 50 and 100 centimeters and are on convex summit and shoulder positions. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; moderate to high runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for timber production, wildlife habitat, and watershed.  Natural vegetation includes Douglas-fir, grand fir, western hemlock, California laurel, tanoak, California huckleberry, oceanspray, western swordfern, thimbleberry, and red huckleberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coastal Redwood Belt 4B. The series is not extensive.
