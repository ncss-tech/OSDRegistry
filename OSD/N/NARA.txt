NARA SERIES

The Nara series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils. The soils formed in sandy, eolian deposits of Holocene age. These soils are on very gently to gently sloping interdunes. Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 406mm (16in), and the mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).

Depth to argillic: 50 to 100 cm (20 to 40 in).
Depth to calcic horizon: more than 100 cm (40 in).
Particle-size control section: 18 to 35 percent silicate clay.
Solum thickness: more than 203cm (80 in).

Visa soils are on similar landscape positions and have argillic horizons greater than 100 cm deep (40 inches) from the mineral soil surface. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: sandy, eolian deposits of Holocene Age.
Landform: very gently sloping to gently sloping interdunes.
Slopes: 1 to 5 percent.
Precipitation Pattern: Precipitation is typically uniform throughout most of the year with rainfall the highest from April through October. Average snowfall is about 18 inches annually from November through April.
Mean annual precipitation: 381 to 432 mm (15 to 17 in)
Thornthwaite P-E Index: 22 to 28

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Corlena, Dallam,Karde,Monia, Perico,Rickmore,Spurlock, Valerian, Vingo, and Visaseries.
Dallam,Perico,and Rickmore soils are on nearly level to gently sloping plains have a fine-loamy particle size control section.
Corlena soils are on narrow floodplains of draws have a fine-silty particle-size class.
Kardesoils are on playa dunes and have carbonatic minerology. 
Visa soils: are on interdunes and dunes and have an argillic horizon between 40 and 60 inches deep.
Spurlocksoils are on similar landscape positions and have argillic horizons and carbonatic mineralogy.
Valerian soils: are on dunes and have a sandy particle size class.
Vingo soils are on similar landscape positions and have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:Well drained, and moderately rapid permeability. Surface runoff is negligible on slopes less than 3 percent, and very low on 3 to 5 percent.

USE AND VEGETATION:Mainly used for livestock grazing. Climax vegetation is a Tall/Midgrass community. The major tallgrass species are sand bluestem and little bluestem. The midgrasses are sideoats grama, sand lovegrass, sand paspalum, fall witchgrass, hairy grama, blue grama, and dropseed, and perennial threeawns. Woody shrubs consist of yucca, skunkbush sumac, and sand sage, and the occasional sand plum thickets. This is a fragile site and is subject to severe wind erosion if not protected by cover. This soil has been correlated to the Sandy (R077BY658TX) ecological site in MLRA-77B, 12-17" PZ.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:Southern High Plains of Texas and New Mexico
(MLRA-77B). Land Resource Region: H - Central Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range Region
MLRA 77B - Southern High Plains, Northwestern Part The series is minor in extent.
