NETTLETON SERIES

The Nettleton series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  They are on alluvial fans.  Permeability is slow.  Average annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Argiaquic Xeric Argialbolls

TYPE LOCATION:  Owyhee County, Idaho; SE1/4 NW1/4 sec. 24, T.4S., R.4W.  (About 300 feet southeast of a pond and 100 feet north of a thermograph in the Reynolds Mountain study area at 6,800 feet elevation and with 14 percent northerly slope.)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Average annual soil temperature - 42 to 47 degrees F.
The soils are usually moist, but are dry for 45 to 70 consecutive days in late summer and fall.
Reaction - strongly acid to neutral
Mollic epipedon - 12 to 19 inches thick
Sola - 35 to 60 inches thick
Depth to the clayey Bt horizon - 15 to 26 inches

A horizon
Hue - 2.5Y or 10YR
Value - 3 or 4 dry, 1 or 2 moist
Chroma - 1 or 2 dry or moist

E horizon
Hue - 2.5Y or 10YR
Value - 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma - 2 or 3 dry or moist
Brighter colored mottles, dark splotches, and fine concretions are few to common

Bt horizon
Hue - 2.5Y or 10YR
Value - 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma -  2 or 3 dry or moist
Clay content - 35 to 55 percent, but does not have an abrupt textural change from the heavy loam or clay loam E horizon to the Bt horizon

The multicolored C horizon is distinctly or prominently mottled.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Houk and Morphy series. The Houk soils have a calcic horizon.  The Morphy soils have a layer of secondary carbonate accumulation

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nettleton soils are on alluvial fans at elevations of 4,200 to 7,000 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent. The soils formed from in alluvium from basaltic and other basic igneous rock sources. The climate is subhumid with relatively dry summers. Mean annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches, the mean annual temperature is 40 degrees to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free season is less than 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the DeMasters, Gabica, Harmehl, Klicker, and Nortune soils, none of which has an A2 horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; medium or slow runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Nearly all is used for range. The natural vegetation is mainly Melica, Sandberg bluegrass, iris, sedges, big sagebrush, cheatgrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, redtop, moss, and in places, rose, yarrow, arbuscula sagebrush, willow, and Idaho fescue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Idaho and adjoining areas. This series is inextensive.
