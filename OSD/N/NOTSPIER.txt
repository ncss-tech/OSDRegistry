NOTSPIER SERIES

The Notspier series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in fine alluvium derived from mixed rock sources resting on weakly consolidated sands.  Notspier soils are on hills and terraces and have slopes of 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 235 millimeters (9 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 17 degrees C. (62.5 degrees F.)

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, isothermic Sodic Haplusterts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Notspier silt loam - on a 2 percent slope facing southeast under a cover of slender oats, Australian saltbush soft chess, cholla and prickly pear cactus at an elevation of 550 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.  When described on 5/19/82 the soil was dry to 4 inches and moist below.

  Bnss1--23 to 43 centimeters (9 to 17 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), moist; strong very coarse prismatic; extremely hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine roots on faces of prisms and ped faces; common very fine tubular pores; few intersecting slickensides and wedge shape aggregates;  slightly acid (pH 6.5); abrupt smooth boundary.

  Bnss2--43 to 69 centimeters (17 to 27 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), moist; strong very coarse prismatic and moderate coarse angular blocky structure; extremely hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine roots on faces of prisms and ped faces; common very fine tubular pores; few intersecting slickensides and wedge shape aggregates; SAR is 34 and EC is 11; slightly acid (pH 6.5); abrupt smooth boundary. (20 to 38 centimeters; 8 to 15 inches thick)

  2Cr--69 to 102 centimeters (27 to 40 inches); light yellowish-brown soft semi-consolidated sand that can be dug with a shovel and that crushes to coarse sand and has lenses of sandy loam.

TYPE LOCATION:  San Clemente Island, Los Angeles County, California, about 2 miles west southwest from main road and old airport towards the magazine area to a Y, then 300 feet west and 300 feet north to site.; 32.94317 degrees latitude, -118.54047 degrees longitude; UTM Zone 11; 3646039.75n, 355996.38e; U.S.G.S.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Mean annual soil temperature: is about 18 degrees C (64 degrees F.).
