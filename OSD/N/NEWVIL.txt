NEWVIL SERIES

The Newvil series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and reworked lacustrine sediments. Newvil soils are on eroded fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 275 mm and the mean annual temperature is 8 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Argiduridic Durixerolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Newvil gravelly sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is partially covered with approximately 40 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles. Lithology of rock fragments is welded tuff.

(8 to 18 cm thick) 

 Bt--8 to 25 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium roots; many very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 15 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.

COMPETING SERIES: These are Mudco, Oxendine, and Terlan series series. 

Mudco, Oxendine, and Terlan soils are not intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative from July through September due to convection storms. Mudco and Oxendine soils do not have secondary calcium carbonate in B horizons or duripan. Terlan soils form in alluvium derived from basalt parent material and lack lacustrine deposits below the duripan.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Newvil soils are on eroded fan remnants at elevations of 1,700 to 2,000 meters. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The soils formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and reworked lacustrine sediments. The climate is cool continental, mesic. The mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm and the frost free period is 90 to 110 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aned, Chuckmill, and Sevenmile series. Aned soils have 5 to 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and a duripan that is strongly or less cemented. Chuckmill soils have a duripan at 25 to 36 cm. Sevenmile soils average 8 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have a cambic horizon from 43 to 86 cm. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; low runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Newvil soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Potential native vegetation is Indian ricegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, black sagebrush, low Douglas rabbitbrush, Nevada ephedra and a minor component of singleleaf pinyon and Utah Juniper. This pedon is correlated to Ecological Site R028AY035NV, Shallow Clay Loam 10-12 P.Z.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: East-central Nevada. Newvil soils are not extensive. MLRA 28A and 29.
