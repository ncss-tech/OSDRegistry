NOXLIN SERIES 

The Noxlin series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over mixed alluvium and glacial outwash.  These soils are on stream terraces. Slopes are 4 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Andic Paleudalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Noxlin ashy silt loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; undecomposed and slightly decomposed forest litter. (1 to 2 inches thick)

    A--2 to 3 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) ashy silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine and medium, and few coarse roots; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 2 inches thick) 

    Bw--3 to 12 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) ashy silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine and medium and few coarse roots; 5 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary. (7 to 11 inches thick) 

    2E--12 to 28 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) very gravelly loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium and few coarse roots; 10 percent cobbles, 35 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary. (12 to 20 inches thick) 

    2E/Bt--28 to 40 inches; E part (70 percent) is very pale brown (10YR 8/2) very gravelly loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist, Bt part (30 percent) is pink (7.5YR 7/4) very gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few medium and coarse roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent cobbles, 45 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 16 inches thick) 

    2Bt/E--40 to 60 inches; Bt part (70 percent) is pink (7.5YR 7/4) very gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist, E part (30 percent) is very pale brown (10YR 8/2) very gravelly loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few coarse roots; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent cobbles, 45 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8).
