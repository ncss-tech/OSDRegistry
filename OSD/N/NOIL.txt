NOIL SERIES

The Noil series consists of deep, well drained soils on mountain slopes and ridges.  They formed in material weathered from metamorphic or granitic rocks with an admixture of volcanic ash and loess.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.  Slope ranges from 35 to 85 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 32 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Noil soils are on mountain slopes and ridges.  Slopes range from 35 to 85 percent.  These soils formed in material weathered from gneiss, schist, granite or quartzite with an admixture of loess and volcanic ash.  These soils occur at elevations of 1,600 to 4,300 feet 	(488 to 1311 meters).  The average annual temperature ranges from 40 to 46 degrees F., with an average annual precipitation of 25 to 55 inches (635 to 1397 mm).  The average frost-free period is from 80 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Kruse, Hugus, Bouldercreek and Brodeer series.  Kruse soils occur on mountain slopes and hills.  They have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section and have an argillic horizon.  Hugus and Bouldercreek soils occur on mountain slopes and hills. They have a udic moisture regime and a thick volcanic ash mantle.  Brodeer soils occur on mountain slopes and ridges.  These soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section, have a udic moisture regime and have a thick volcanic ash mantle.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is rapid to very rapid and saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed.  Some cleared areas are used for pasture.  Potential natural vegetation is mainly grand fir, Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine and western larch with an understory of Rocky mountain maple, mallow ninebark, common snowberry, myrtle pachystima, Hooker fairybells, sweet scented bedstraw, starry false Solomons seal, goldthread, elk sedge and Columbia brome.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North Central Idaho.  This soil is not extensive.  MLRA 43A.
