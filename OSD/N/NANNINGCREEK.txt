NANNINGCREEK SERIES

The Nanningcreek series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from sandstone with minor amounts of siltstone and gravelly conglomerate. Nanningcreek soils are on mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1525 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nanningcreek soils are on linear to concave backslope positions on mountain slopes. Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. Elevations are 30 to 365 meters. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from sandstone with minor amounts of siltstone and gravelly conglomerate. The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1140 to 2160 millimeters. Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C, mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C, and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C. Frost free season is about 240 to 300 days.
 
GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Fiedler, Oeschger, Petellen, and Scotiabluffs soils. Fiedler and Oeschger soils lack redoximorphic features within 100 centimeters. Petellen soils have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section.  Scotiabluffs soils have a paralithic contact between 50 and 100 centimeters. Scotiabluffs soils are on convex positions on ridges and mountain slopes. Oeschger soils are on linear to slightly concave or convex positions and Petellen soils are on linear to convex positions on ridges and mountain slopes
 
DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained, medium to very high runoff, moderately high to high saturated hydraulic conductivity. The soil has a high water table between 50 and 100 centimeters January through April.
 
USE AND VEGETATION: 
This soil is used for timber production, wildlife habitat, watershed, and recreation. Natural vegetation includes redwood, Douglas-fir, Sitka spruce, grand fir, tanoak, red alder, Pacific madrone, California hazel, California huckleberry, salal, thimbleberry, red huckleberry, and western swordfern.

 
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coastal Redwood Belt; MLRA 4B. The series is not extensive.
