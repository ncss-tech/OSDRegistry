NEBAGO SERIES

The Nebago series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are moderately deep to clayey lacustrine deposits. These soils formed in sandy deposits and in the underlying clayey lacustrine deposits on glacial lake basins. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 710 mm (28 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 7.8 degrees C (46 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nebago soils are in broad glacial lake basins on slightly elevated sand knolls and ridges. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. The soil is formed in sandy deposits and the underlying reddish clayey lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 635 to 740 mm (25 to 29 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 6.7 to 8.9 degrees C (44 to 48 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brems, Borth, Kewaunee, Manawa, Poy, Poygan, and Zittau soils. The moderately well drained Borth soils, somewhat poorly drained Zittau soils, and poorly drained Poy soils are nearby in glacial lake basins. These soils are clayey over sandy or sandy-skeletal. Moderately well drained Brems soils, which are sandy throughout, occupy slightly higher positions on the landscape. Well drained Kewaunee soils, somewhat poorly drained Manawa soils, and poorly drained Poygan soils occupy nearby areas on the till plain. These soils are clayey throughout. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. The potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high to very high (42.34 to 141.14 micrometers per second) in the sandy mantle and moderately low to moderately high (0.42 to 4.23 micrometers per second) in the clayey lacustrine deposits. Permeability is rapid in the sandy mantle and moderately slow or slow in the clayey lacustrine deposits. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of this soil are used for cropland or woodland. Corn, small grain, and hay are the principal crops. A small acreage is used for pastureland. Natural vegetation is mixed deciduous and coniferous forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central and east-central Wisconsin. This soil is moderately extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Winnebago County, Wisconsin, 1977.

REMARKS: Nebago soils were formerly mapped as Rimer soils but the absence of an argillic horizon in the sandy mantle and in the lower clayey deposits is outside the range of the Rimer series. The soils of this series are arenic, but a subgroup of Aquic Arenic Dystric Eutrudepts is not provided for in Soil Taxonomy.

11/2006 - All of the acres correlated in Waupaca and Waushara Counties and most of the acres correlated in Winnebago County are formed in sandy deposits over clayey lacustrine deposits. Therefore, this revision limits the series concept to sandy deposits over clayey lacustrine deposits only. However, some of the acres correlated in Winnebago County are in drainageways in till uplands and are sandy deposits over clayey till. A new series may be needed for these acres.

There are 1750 acres of Nebago, sandy substratum phase correlated as a consociation in Waupaca County and another 498 acres in the Borth-Nebago-Meehan complex. A new series may be needed.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - 0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 inches) (Ap); cambic horizon - 81 to 117 cm (32 to 46 inches) (2Bw, 3Bw, 3BC); Dystric feature  no carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches); aquic feature  redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less and saturation within 61 cm (24 inches) of the soil surface.
