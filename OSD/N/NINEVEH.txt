NINEVEH SERIES

The Nineveh series consists of very deep, well drained soils that are moderately deep to calcareous, stratified gravelly and sandy outwash. The Nineveh soils formed in loamy deposits. They are on stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1041 mm (41 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, active, mesic Typic Argiudolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Nineveh sandy loam, on a 1 percent slope in a cultivated field at an elevation of about 204 meters (670 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

[15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 inches) thick]

 Bt3--84 to 91 cm (33 to 36 inches); dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) gravelly clay loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; firm; few distinct dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) clay films on faces of peds and clay bridging between sand grains; 20 percent gravel; slightly alkaline; abrupt irregular boundary. [5 to 51 cm (2 to 20 inches) thick]

 2C--91 to 152 cm (36 to 60 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), pale brown (10YR 6/3), and light gray (10YR 7/2) stratified very gravelly coarse sand and sand; single grain; loose; tongues of Bt horizon extend to a depth of 114 to 147 cm (45 to 58 inches) and are 46 to 61 cm (18 to 24) inches apart; 43 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Lorenzo series. Lorenzo soils have sola less than 61 cm (24 inches) in thickness.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nineveh soils are on treads on stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. The soils formed in loamy deposits. They are moderately deep to calcareous, stratified gravelly and sandy outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1118 mm (36 to 44 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 56 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Fox, Homer, Rodman, Sleeth, Westland, and Whitaker soils. Fox soils do not have a mollic epipedon and are on similar landscapes. Homer, Sleeth, and Whitaker soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on slightly lower positions. Rodman soils are excessive drained, are less than 51 cm (20 inches) to sand and gravel, and are on terrace risers. Westland soils are poorly drained or very poorly drained and are in depressions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The depth to the top of a seasonal high water table is greater than 183 cm (6 feet). The potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and very high in the substratum. Permeability is moderate in the solum and very rapid in the substratum. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Nineveh soils are mostly cultivated. The principal crops grown are corn, soybeans, wheat, and hay. Some areas are used for growing green beans, potatoes, tomatoes, strawberries, and other vegetables and fruits. Irrigation is used on this soil in some areas. Native vegetation is prairie grass with widely spaced trees, chiefly oak, hawthorn, walnut, and wild cherry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central and south-central Indiana and western Ohio; MLRA 111A. The series is of moderate extent.
