NORBERT SERIES

The Norbert series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum from semiconsolidated shale at depths of 10 to 20 inches.  These soils are on sedimentary plains, hills, and escarpments.  Slopes are 4 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, smectitic, calcareous, frigid, shallow
Typic Ustorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Norbert clay, native grassland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

    A--0 to 2 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine roots and pores; disseminated lime, strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick)

    Bw1--2 to 6 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate fine and medium blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine roots; few fine pores; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); clear wavy boundary.

    Bw2--6 to 9 inches; light olive gray (5Y 6/2) clay, olive gray (5Y 4/2) moist; massive; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine roots; common fine pores; few partly weathered soft shale chips; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (Combined Bw horizons 0 to 7 inches thick)

    Bky--9 to 18 inches; olive gray (5Y 5/2) clay, olive gray (5Y 4/2) moist; massive; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine roots; common fine crystals of gypsum; few fine masses of lime; disseminated lime; 5 percent hard shale fragments and 15 percent soft shale fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary. (6 to 10 inches thick)

    Cr--18 to 60 inches; olive gray (5Y 5/2) semiconsolidated shale that crushes  to a clay texture, olive gray (5Y 4/2) moist; common fine and few medium roots that are in the vertical and horizontal bedding planes; common medium gypsum crystals.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Big Horn County (Big Horn Area), Montana; 1970.

REMARKS: Soil interpretation record:  MT0276.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 7 inches (after mixing) (A, Bw1 and Bw2 horizons); paralithic contact - at a depth of 18 inches (Cr horizon); particle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 18 inches (By horizon).  Norbert soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
