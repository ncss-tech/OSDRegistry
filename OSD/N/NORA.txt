Some pedons have loamy or sandy materials below a depth of 150 centimeters

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Egan, Ihlen, Moody, Splitrock, and Wentworth series.
Egan--have glacial till at depths between 50 and 100 centimeters

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alcester, Colo, Crofton, Moody, Muir, Trent, and Whitewood soils.
Alcester--have mollic epipedons more than 50 centimeters thick and are on foot slopes below the Nora soils and in narrow valleys

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Minnehaha County, South Dakota, 1958.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from 0 to a depth of 23 centimeters (Ap horizon);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 23 to 56 centimeters (Bw horizon).

During the correlation of Minnehaha county SD, the type location site was moved to better represent the series.
