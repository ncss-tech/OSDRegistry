GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Narea soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. These soils formed in sandy alluvium derived from granite. Elevations are 1,875 to 3,300 feet. The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 2 to 6 inches; the mean annual air temperature is 64 to 69 degrees F. and the frost-free season is 240 to 300 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Desfirex, Edalph and Macagce soils. Desfirex soils have an argillic horizon and a duripan at 20 to 30 inches. Edalph soils do not have a durinodic horizon. Macagce soils have a durinodic horizon at 5 to 10 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; very low to medium runoff; rapid over very rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Narea soils are used for military exercises and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly white bursage, creosotebush, desert senna and ratany.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southeastern California, U.S.A.; MLRA 30. These soils are of small extent.
