NEWULM SERIES

The Newulm series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils. These gently sloping to strongly sloping upland soils formed in sandy and loamy sediments derived from the Willis Formation of late Pliocene age.  Slope ranges from 1 to 12 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 74 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 44 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Arenic Haplustults

TYPICAL PEDON:  Newulm sand--on a convex 4 percent slope in rangeland.
(Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 4 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) sand; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; single grained; loose; nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and medium fine roots; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)

    E--4 to 22 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/4) sand; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) moist; single grained; loose; nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (14 to 26 inches thick)

(3 to 6 inches thick)

    BtC1--31 to 65 inches; dark red (2.5YR 3/6) sandy loam; dark red (2.5YR 3/6) moist; weak very coarse prismatic structure; massive within prisms; very hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots penetrating gray zones; few distinct clay films on vertical surfaces of prisms; 5 percent medium distinct light gray (10YR 7/1) iron depletions with sharp boundaries along vertical surfaces of peds; very strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.

    BtC2--65 to 80 inches; light gray (10YR 7/1) clay loam; light gray (10YR 7/1) moist; weak very coarse prismatic structure with fractures spaced about 6 to 18 inches apart; very hard, friable; few fine roots; few prominent dark red (2.5YR 3/6) clay films along surfaces of prisms; 2 percent medium prominent dark red (2.5YR 3/6) masses of iron accumulation with sharp boundaries on surfaces of peds; very strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Austin County, Texas; from intersection of Farm Road 949 and Farm Road 1094 which is about 1 mile north of Cat Spring; 2.6 miles west on Farm Road 1094; 1.3 miles north on a private road; 50 feet east of road in rangeland.  Latitude: 29 degrees, 53 minutes, 15 seconds North; Longitude: 96 degrees, 21 minutes, 44 seconds West.  Bellville, Texas USGS topographic quadrangle; NAD 1927.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 80 inches. Base saturation ranges from 9 to 35 percent at a point 50 inches below the top of the Bt horizon.  Combined thickness of the A horizon range from 20 to 40 inches.  The gray matrix colors in the BCt or BC horizon is derived from the parent material and is not due to wetness.

Soil Moisture: An udic soil moisture regime.  The soil moisture control section, 4 to 12 inches, is typically moist from September to July in most years.  The cumulative total number of days the soil moisture control section is dry is less than 90 days.

Mean annual soil temperature: 69 to 72 degrees F.
Depth to argillic horizon: 20 to 40 inches
Thickness of the A and E, 20 to 40 inches

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no series in the same family.  Similar soils are the Briley, Catilla, Dutek, Gomery, Knolle, Padina, Silawa, Stidham, Tenaha, Tremona, and Trep.
Briley, Gomery, Tenaha, and Trep series: remain moist for longer periods
Catilla, Dutek, Knolle, Padina, Silawa, Stidham, and Tremona series: more than 35 percent base saturation

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: sandy and loamy sediments derived from the Willis Formation of late Pliocene age
Landform: Coastal Plain on uplands
Slope: 1 to 12 percent but typically 3 to 5 percent
Mean annual temperature: 67 to 69 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 40 to 48 inches
Precipitation Pattern: Precipitation is fairly uniform throughout the year with slight peaks in the spring and fall.  Summertime rainfall is controlled by the influx of tropical moisture.
Frost-free period: 240 to 270 days
Elevation: 175 to 300 feet
Thornthwaite annual P-E indices: 52 to 72

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Catilla, Straber and  Tremona series.
Catilla series: on gently sloping broad summits
Straber series: sandy surface layer less than 20 inches thick; clayey subsoil; on footslopes
Tremona series: on a lower toe and footslope position

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Runoff is very low on 1 to 3 percent slopes, low on 3 to 5 percent slopes, and medium on slopes more than 5 percent.

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used for rangeland.  A few areas are used for improved pasture.  Native vegetation is an open savannah with post oak and blackjack oak.  Understory is mainly mid and tall prairie grass with a variety of forbs and legumes.  With retrogression, yaupon, oaks, and eastern red cedar increase to form dense thickets.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeast Texas; LRR T; MLRA 150A; small extent

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle size control section: 22 to 42 inches.  (Bt and BtC1 horizons)
The base saturation at 50 inches below the top of the argillic is less than 35 percent.
Ochric epipedon - 0 to 22 inches.  (A and E horizons)
Arenic - thickness of A & E horizons is sandy to a depth of 20 to 40 inches.
Argillic - 22 to 80 inches.  (Bt and BCt horizons)
Clay decrease with depth - the clay control decreases with depth from the top of the argillic by more than 20 percent absolute within the depth of 60 inches.

Additional Comments: The series was revised in January 2001 as part of the update of MLRA 150A .  The classification was changed from thermic to hyperthermic temperature regime.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data number S81TX-015-1 and S81TX-015-2 from Austin County, Texas.
