SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Distribution: North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia
Extent: Moderate 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Anson County, North Carolina, 1999.

REMARKS: 
Nanford soils were formerly mapped as Nason soils.  Nason soils have mixed mineralogy and formed from sericite schist, phyllite, or other fine-grained metamorphic rocks.  The November 2025 revision corrected some of the formatting. No data was changed.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches) (A horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 15 to 79 inches (6 to 31 inches) (Bt horizons)
Paralithic contact--soft weathered bedrock at 142 centimeters (56 inches)(Cr horizon)
