NAZ SERIES

The Naz series consist of deep or very deep, well or somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum mainly from intermediate intrusive, quartzitic metamorphic, and porphyritic rocks.  They are on mountains with slopes of 10 to 90 percent.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high.  The average annual precipitation is about 750mm, and the average annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Pachic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Naz sandy loam -- on a 50 percent southeasterly slope, forested.  (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Oe--0 to 5 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moderately decayed leaves, needles, and twigs; slightly acid (pH 6.5); abrupt, wavy boundary.  (0 to 8 cm thick)

    A1--5 to 45 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, and medium, common coarse roots; many very fine irregular and tubular pores; 3 percent angular gravel, mostly less than 5 mm. in diameter; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear, smooth boundary.  (13 to 50 cm thick)

    A2--45 to 78 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine, and medium, few coarse roots; many very fine irregular and common very fine tubular pores; 13 percent angular gravel, mostly less than 5 mm. in diameter; slightly acid (pH 6.5); gradual, wavy boundary.  (15 to 48 cm thick)

    C--78 to 123 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) coarse sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine irregular and tubular pores; 12 percent angular gravel, mostly less than 5 mm. in diameter; neutral (pH 6.7); clear, smooth boundary.  (28 to 100 cm thick)

    Cr--123 to 155 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) gravelly coarse sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; commonly stained very pale brown (10YR 7/4) and light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4), brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; moderately cemented; many fine mica flakes; neutral (pH 6.9).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform - sideslopes, swales, and concave positions on mountains, at lower elevations most have northerly aspects
Slopes - 10 to 90 percent
Parent material - colluvium and residuum from intermediate intrusive, quartzitic metamorphic, and related porphyritic rocks

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bryan, Coski, Ligget, Pyle, and Scriver soils.  These soils do not have a pachic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well or somewhat excessively drained; medium to very rapid runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Naz soils are used mainly for forestry, grazing, watershed, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  The dominant natural vegetation is Grand fir, Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, pin cherry, chokecherry, ninebark, willow, Rocky Mountain maple, and twinberry in Idaho.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern part of Idaho batholith.  The soils are moderately extensive.  MLRAs 43B, 43C, and 9.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Middle Fork Payette River Area, Idaho, 1969.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon:

Mollic epipedon - the zone from 5 to 78 cm (A1 and A2 horizons) (There is less than 0.6 percent organic carbon below 78 cm.  Dark colors are due to parent material).

Paralithic contact - at 123cm (Cr horizon)

Laboratory data exists for a pedon sampled as Naz (xeric moisture regime): Lab Pedon #06N1084, KSSL.

Naz series is mapped in ID617 at lower elevations (<1525m) and needs to be investigated as a potential frigid taxadjunct to the series.  The depth class and moisture regime of Naz should also be investigated across its extent (currently mapped as deep and very deep).
