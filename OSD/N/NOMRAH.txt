NOMRAH SERIES 

The Nomrah series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material and alluvium derived from sandstone. Nomrah soils are on remnant stream terraces and footslopes of stable landslides and have moderate permeability. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Calcidic Haplustalfs

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Alire (T) (NM), Banquito (NM), Brumley (CO), Goesling (NM), Maia (NM), Pollow (T) (CO,) and Todest (NM) series. Alire soils contain volcanic glass in the coarse silt and very fine sand fractions. Pollow and Todest soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Brumley, Goesling, and Maia soils are 40 inches or less to the base of the argillic horizon and the calcic horizon does not include the argillic. In addition, Maia soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments. Banquito soils are inactive.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nomrah soils are on stream terraces and footslopes of stable landslides. They formed in eolian material and alluvium derived from sandstone. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,800 to 7,800 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches with about half falling as winter snow and half falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 100 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Iwela soil and the Vosburg soil. Iwela soils lack calcic horizons and have skeletal substrata. Vosburg soils have mollic epipedon and occur on adjacent toeslopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Nomrah soils are used for livestock grazing and fuelwood production. Present vegetation is pinyon, Utah juniper, muttongrass, blue grama, bottlebrush squirreltail, Wyoming big sagebrush, and black sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: These soils occur in northwest New Mexico and southeastern Utah. MLRA 35 and 36, LRR-D. Nomrah soils are of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Shiprock Area, Parts of San Juan County, New Mexico and Apache County, Arizona; 1993.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 3 inches (A horizon)

Argillic horizon - the zone from 3 to 58 inches. (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Btk1, and Btk2 horizons)

Calcic horizon - the zone from 32 to 58 inches (Btk1 and Btk2 horizons)

ADDITIONAL DATA: Calcium carbonate equivalence was determined with a field volume calcimeter. Organic carbon values are estimated.
