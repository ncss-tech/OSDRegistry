NORTHMORE SERIES

The Northmore series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks.  Northmore soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Brownscombe, Bucklake, Cagle, Correco, Holmzie, Jasseek, Perla, Schoer, Sherar, Wicup, and Zymans series.

Brownscombe, Cagle, Holmzie, Sherar, and Wicup soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Bucklake and Perla soils are moderately seep to lithic contacts.  Correco soils have less than 15 percent coarse and very coarse sand in the particle-size control section.  Jasseek soils have less than 45 percent sand in the particle-size control section and do not have subhorizons of the argillic with durinodes.  Schoer soils are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and have sandy-skeletal material within depths of 100 cm.  Zymans soils have 45 to 60 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarse and very coarse sand in the particle-size control section and do not have sandy loam C horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Northmore soils are on fan remnants that are somewhat dissected by intermittent drainageways.  They formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks such as granodiorite and andesite.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,375 to 1,680 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 9 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cassiro, Greenbrae, Indian Creek, and Wedekind soils.  Cassiro soils have more than 35 percent gravel in the Bt2 horizon.  Greenbrae soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section.  Indian Creek soils have a duripan.  Wedekind soils are underlain by weathered andesite at 25 to 50 cm.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium or high surface runoff; slow permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Northmore soils are used for rangeland, recreation, and urban development.  The vegetation consists of Wyoming big sagebrush, rabbitbrush, horsebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, and annuals. This pedon is correlated to R026XY010NV, Loamy 10-12" P.Z.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  These soils are not extensive with about 2,200 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 26.
