NIKAT SERIES

The Nikat series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in alluvium, slope alluvium or colluvium derived from limestone.  These soils occur on alluvial fans, fan remnants, colluvial aprons, hills and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 480 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic Ustic Calcicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Nikat gravelly loam, in rangeland on a 40 percent slope at an elevation of 2295 meters (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

	A--0 to 15 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak very fine and fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine irregular pores; 20 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 40 cm thick)

	Bk1--15 to 33 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine, and few medium roots; many very fine tubular and irregular pores; 25 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; finely disseminated calcium carbonate, 5 percent soft masses of calcium carbonate, and 75 percent fine distinct irregular calcium carbonate nodules on bottom of rock fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 50 cm thick)

	Bk2--33 to 69 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; 40 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; finely disseminated calcium carbonate, 10 percent soft masses of calcium carbonate, and 60 percent medium distinct irregular calcium carbonate nodules on rock fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 50 cm thick)

 	Bk3--69 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) extremely gravelly loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 50 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; finely disseminated calcium carbonate, 5 percent soft masses of calcium carbonate, and 60 percent medium distinct irregular calcium carbonate nodules on rock fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).
