COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this classification.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Drainage class: poorly drained
Parent material: ash influence loess over sandy and gravelly till
Landform: moraines on till plains
Slopes: 0 to 15 percent
Climate: transitional maritime-continental
Mean annual temperature: about 35 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: about 30 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Puntilla and Tuxedni soils. Puntilla soils are well drained and occur on nunataks. Tuxedni soils are somewhat poorly drained and occur on similar landforms.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained, very high runoff, saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the solum and high or very high in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is Lutz spruce, shrubs, forbs, and grass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 224 Cook Inlet Lowland, South-central Alaska, The series is of small extent.
