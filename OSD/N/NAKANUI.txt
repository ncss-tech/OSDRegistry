NAKANUI SERIES

The Nakanui series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils formed in basic volcanic ash and gravel over basic pahoehoe lava.  Slopes range from 2 to 10 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 1,016 millimeters (40 inches), and the mean annual air temperature is about 20 degrees C. (68 degrees F.).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Medial, amorphic, isothermic Lithic Haplustands

TYPICAL PEDON: Nakanui medial loam, 2 percent slope under scattered trees and shrubs and a grass understory at an elevation of 823 meters (2,700 feet). (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on 4/7/98 the soil was slightly moist throughout.  The soil temperature was 19 degrees C. (66 degrees F.) at a depth of 28 centimeters (11 inches).  All textures are "apparent field textures".  pH was measured using electrode in 1:1 water.)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.  Ahiu soils are similar.  Ahiu soils are medial and do not have coarse fragments.    

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nakanui soils are on Kilauea pahoehoe flows 750 to 1,500 years old at elevations of 305 to 853 meters (1,000 to 2,800 feet).  Slopes range from 2 to 10 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is 1,016 to 1,270 millimeters (40 to 50 inches), with about 90 percent of the rainfall occurring between October and May.  The mean annual pan evaporation is 1,778 to 2,032 (70 to 80 inches).  The mean annual air temperature is 18 to 21 degrees C. (64 to 70 degrees F.)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kahali`i, Kanohina, Lithic Haplustands, and the similar Ahiu soils.  Kanohina soils are isohyperthermic.  Kahali`i soils are sandy and have an upper horizon of cinders.  Lithic Haplustands have varying textures ranging from loam to coarse cinders.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained.  Runoff is very high.  Permeability is rapid in the soil and very slow in the underlying pahoehoe bedrock.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for National Park Service land.  Vegetation is `a`ali`i (Dodonaea viscosa), bamboo orchid (Arundina graminifolia), broomsedge (Andropogon virginicus), bush beardgrass (Schizachyrium condensatum), firetree or faya tree (Myrica faya), mamane (Sophora chrysophylla), molassesgrass (Melinis minutiflora), `ohi`a lehua (Metrosideros polymorpha), pukiawe (Styphelia tameiameiae), `ulei (Osteomeles anthyllidifolia), sour bush (Pluchea symphytifolia), and thatchinggrass (Hyparrhenia rufa).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: These soils are within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park; MLRA 161.  The series is of small extent.
