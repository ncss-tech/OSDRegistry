NECHES SERIES

The Neches series consists of very deep well drained soils. These gently sloping soils formed in sandy and loamy sediments derived from dredge spoil banks. Slope ranges from 2 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 21.1 degrees C (70 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1524 mm (50 to 60 in).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. Similar soils are the Riolomas and Grayrock series.
Riolomas soils have a calcareous reaction class and mixed mineralogy.
Grayrock soils have a fine-silty particle-size control section and are in the thermic temperature regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: sandy over loamy dredge spoil material
Landscape: Lagoons
Landform: Flats
Anthropogenic: dredge spoil banks
Slope: 2 to 5 percent
Mean annual air temperature range: 20.0 to 22.2 degrees C (68 to 72 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation range: 1270 to 1524 mm (50 to 60 in)
Frost-free period: 250 to 270 days
Elevation: 1.5 to 8 m (5 to 25 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Barbary, Ijam, Larose, Neel, and Sievers series.

Barbary and Larose soils have a very-fine particle-size control section. 
Ijam and Neel soils have a fine particle-size control section. 
Sievers soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section. 
Barbary soils are on lower positions in swamps.
 Ijam and Sievers soils are on lower landscape positions. 
Larose soils are lower in the landscape in fresh water marshes.
Neel soils are on similar landscape positions. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Neches soils are well drained. Runoff is very low. Permeability is slow. The permeability is reduced by the variable clayey and loamy layers throughout the soil. Permeability is variable in pedons or areas where clayey strata are not present or continuous. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used primarily for pastureland or wildlife land. Pastures are predominantly coastal or common bermudagrass. Other vegetation is silver bluestem, bushy bluestem, and doveweed. Loblolly pine and chinese tallow trees have encroached in most areas.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Gulf Coast Prairie (MLRA 150A) and Gulf Coast Saline Prairies (150B) mainly along the lower reaches of the Neches River in southeast Texas. The series is of minor extent.
