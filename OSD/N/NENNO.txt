NENNO SERIES

The Nenno series consists of somewhat poorly drained soils which are shallow or moderately deep to a densic contact with till. These soils formed in loamy till, typically with a thin loess mantle, on ground moraines and on footslopes and broad summits of drumlins.  Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches). Mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Aquic Argiudolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Nenno silt loam - on a 1 percent slope in a cultivated field at an elevation of about 306 meters (1,005 feet) above mean sea level.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Ap--0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak medium granular structure; friable; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  [18 to 25 cm (7 to 10 inches) thick]

   E--20 to 25 cm (8 to 10 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  [0 to 8 cm (0 to 3 inches) thick]

   2Bt1--25 to 38 cm (10 to 15 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) clay loam; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; firm; common distinct very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay films on faces of peds; about 3 percent gravel;  slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.

   2Bt2--38 to 53 cm (15 to 21 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam; moderate medium angular blocky structure; firm; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; many medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; many medium faint grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions in the matrix; slightly alkaline; abrupt irregular boundary.  [Combined thickness of the Bt horizons ranges from 13 to 43 cm (5 to 17 inches).]

   2Cd--53 to 152 cm (21 to 60 inches); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly sandy loam; massive; firm;  many medium distinct brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; many medium distinct light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) iron depletions in the matrix; about 25 percent gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Dodge County, Wisconsin; about 2 miles northwest of Theresa; about 1040 feet north and 2290 feet west of the southeast corner of sec. 5, T. 12 N., R. 17 E. USGS Lomira, Wisconsin Topographic quadrangle; lat. 43 degrees 31minutes 56 seconds N., and long. 88 degrees 29 minutes 20 seconds W.; NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Depth to the base of the argillic horizon and depth to carbonates both: 31 to 61 cm (12 to 24 inches) but do not always coincide
Depth to the densic contact: 31 to 61 cm (12 to 24 inches)
Thickness of the loess mantle: 0 to 31 cm (0 to 12 inches)
Thickness of the mollic epipedon: 13 to 31 cm (5 to 12 inches)
Volume of gravel: 0 to 5 percent in the loess: 0 to 20 percent in the upper part of the soil formed in till;  5 to 35 percent in the lower part of the soil formed in til and in the till substratum
Volume of cobbles: 0 to 1 percent in the loess; 0 to 10 percent in the till
Reaction: slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the A and B horizons; moderately alkaline in the C horizon
Saturation and redox features: within 41 cm (16 inches) of the soil surface or saturation within 76 cm (30 inches) of the surface in one or more horizons with a total thickness of 15 cm (6 inches) or more with redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less (or chroma of 3 or less with hues of 2.5Y or yellower). 

Ap horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 3
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: silt loam, loam or clay loam in severely eroded phases

A horizons [8 to 13 cm (3 to 5 inches) thick]:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 2 or 3
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: silt loam or loam

E horizon (where present):
Hue: 10YR
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: silt loam where there is a loess mantle and is loam where there is none.

Bt or 2Bt horizon: 
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 3 to 5
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: typically clay loam or loam or the gravelly analogues, but in some pedons it is fine sandy loam or sandy loam or the gravelly analogues. 

Cd or 2Cd horizon:

Value: 5 or 6
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: loam, sandy loam or the gravelly analogues

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Aurand, Crane, Mokena, Nachusa, and Tiderishi sries. All of these soils are more than 61 cm (24 inches) thick to the base of the argillic horizon and to carbonates. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nenno soils are on ground moraines and on footslopes and broad summits of drumlins. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent.  These soils formed in loamy till, typically with a thin loess mantle.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 660 to 890 mm (26 to 35 inches). Mean annual temperature is estimated to range from 7.2 to 10.6 degrees C (45 to 51 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Hochheim, Lamartine, Mayville, and Theresa soils.  The well drained Hochheim soils form a drainage sequence with the somewhat poorly drained Nenno soils.  The Hochheim soils are on the more sloping relief.  Where the loess mantle thickens,  the well drained Theresa soils are on the steeper slopes in some areas and the moderately well drained Mayville and somewhat poorly drained Lamartine soils are on the gently sloping or depressional sites in some areas.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  Runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the surface and subsoil and moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers per second) in the substratum. Permeability is moderate in the surface and subsoil and moderately slow in the substratum.  These soil have a seasonal perched high water table at a depth of 31 to 76 cm (1 to 2.5 feet) for some time in most years. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of these soils are used for cropland. Common crops are corn, small grains, and hay.   Some areas are used for woodland or pastureland.   Native vegetation is deciduous forests with maple-basswood predominating.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  MLRAs 95A, 95B, and 110 in southeastern Wisconsin.  The Nenno soils are of moderate extent.

REMARKS:  
7/04  NSSL data is needed to verify cation-exchange activity class and to determine presence or absence of densic materials in the substratum. Based on NSSL data for three pedons from series formed in the same till (one Hochheim pedon and two Theresa pedons) the concept of the till is changed to densic material (2Cd).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon - 0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 inches) (Ap -  the thickness of the epipedon is more than 1/3 the thickness from the top of the epipedon to the base of the argillic horizon); argillic horizon - 25 to 53 cm (10 to 21 inches) (Bt1, Bt2); aquic feature  saturation and redox features within 41 cm (16 inches) of the soil surface.
