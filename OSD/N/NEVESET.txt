NEVESET SERIES

The Neveset series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived from sedimentary rock.  Neveset soils are on cuestas, ledges and structural benches.  Slopes range from 5 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 27 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Lithic Ustic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Neveset very cobbly fine sandy loam, on a west facing, convex, 8 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 1,559 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The surface is covered by about 35 percent cobbles and 15 percent gravel.

    A--0 to 6 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very cobbly fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4), moist; weak medium and fine granular structure; very friable, soft, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few coarse and medium roots and common fine and very fine roots; 20 percent cobbles, 1 percent channers, 25 percent gravel; strongly effervescent (9 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are finely disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); abrupt wavy boundary.  (5 to 16 cm thick)

    Bk--6 to 25 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very gravelly loam, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), moist; massive; friable, slightly hard, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; common fine and very fine roots; 10 percent cobbles, 40 percent gravel; strongly effervescent (17 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are finely disseminated in matrix, common discontinuous carbonate coats on bottoms of rock fragments; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); abrupt wavy boundary.  (15 to 36 cm thick)

    R--25 cm; indurated calcareous conglomerate bedrock. 
  
TYPE LOCATION:  Emery County, Utah; about 16 kilometers (10 miles) NNW of Woodside; in the NW  SE  corner  of sec. 4, T. 17 S., R. 13 E.; Grassy USGS quad; lat. 39 degrees 22 minutes 20 seconds N. and long. 110 degrees 27 minutes 47 seconds W., NAD 83

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture:  The soil moisture control section is usually dry, but intermittently moist during late summer and early fall.  Aridic moisture regime bordering on ustic.
Mean annual soil temperature:  8 to 11 degrees C.
Depth to lithic contact:  20 to 50 cm to bedrock
Depth to calcic horizon:  5 to 16 cm
Thickness of the calcic horizon:  15 to 36 cm

Particle-size control section (weighted averages):  
  Clay content:  15 to 27 percent
  Rock fragment content:  35 to 70 percent cobbles and gravel

A horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR
Value:  5 or 6 dry; 4 or 5 moist
Chroma:  3 or 4 dry; 4 moist
Texture:  very cobbly fine sandy loam, very bouldery fine sandy loam
Clay content:  12 to 22 percent
Rock fragments:  35 to 60 percent total; 0 to 20 percent boulders, 0 to 10 percent stones, 0 to 35 percent cobbles, 15 to 45 percent gravel
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  1 to 15 percent
EC (mmhos/cm):  0 to 4
SAR:  0 to 2
Reaction:  slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline

Bk horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR
Value:  4 to 7 dry; 4 to 6 moist
Chroma:  3 or 4 dry or moist
Texture:  very gravelly loam, very bouldery loam
Clay content:  18 to 27 percent
Rock fragments:  35 to 60 percent total; 0 to 15 percent boulders, 0 to 10 percent stones, 0 to 15 percent cobbles, 15 to 50 percent gravel
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  15 to 35 percent
EC (mmhos/cm):  0 to 4
Gypsum:  0 to 1 percent
SAR:  0 to 4

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Mellenthin (UT) and Walknolls (CO) series. Mellenthin soils have mean annual soil temperature greater than 11 degrees C., and the soil profile is dominated by stony colluvium.  Walknolls soils have hue yellower than 7.5YR and the Bk horizon is dominated by channers and flagstones. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium derived from sedimentary rock over residuum weathered from calcareous sandstone or conglomerate, principally Cretaceous formations.
Landform:  cuestas, ledges and structural benches
Slopes:  5 to 40 percent
Elevation:  1,524 to 2,195 meters
Mean annual temperature:  7.2 to 10.0 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation:  229 to 305 mm
Precipitation pattern:  Wettest months are July to October and driest months are December and June.
Frost-free period:  120 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cedar Mountain (UT), Gerst (UT), Lanver (UT) and Lazear (CO) series.  The Cedar Mountain and moderately deep Lanver soils have SAR greater than 13 below the A horizon and are derived from sodic shale.   Gerst and Lazear soils are loamy in the particle-size control section and do not have a calcic horizon.  These soils are downslope from the Neveset soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  well drained, high or very high runoff, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Grazing and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation consists of Utah juniper, twoneedle pinyon, black sagebrush, Salina wildrye, galleta and bluebunch wheatgrass.  Utah correlates this soil to Semidesert Shallow Loam (Utah Juniper-Pinyon) R034XYU233UT ecological site.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Utah, Warm Central Desertic Basins and Plateaus; LRR D, MLRA 34B; small extent; about 1,320 hectares (3,300 acres) in Emery County, Utah.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Emery County, Utah; Emery Area, Utah, , Parts of Emery, Carbon, Grand and Sevier Counties soil survey area, 2010. The name is coined from nearby Neversweat Wash.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 25 cm.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 0 to 25 cm.  (A and Bk horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 6 cm.  (A horizon)
Calcic horizon:  The zone from 6 to 25 cm.  (Bk horizon)
Lithic contact:  The contact with indurated conglomerate at 25 cm.  (R layer)

This series was previously included with the Mellenthin series. The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from similar soils in the surrounding area.
