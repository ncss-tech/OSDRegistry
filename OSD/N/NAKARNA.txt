NAKARNA SERIES

The Nakarna series consists of deep, well drained soils on mountain slopes and ridges. They formed in material weathered from micaceous schist and have a thick mantle of volcanic ash. Permeability is moderate. Slope ranges from 5 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 975 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nakarna soils are on mountain slopes and ridges. These soils formed in weathered material derived dominantly from decomposed micaceous schist and have a thick mantle of volcanic ash. Slopes are 5 to 75 percent. Elevation ranges from 485 to 1,525 meters. The climate is cool, humid with warm, moist summers and cool, wet winters. The average annual precipitation is 625 to 1,350 mm, and the average air temperature is 3.5 to 7.8 degrees C. The frost-free season is 50 to 110 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ahrs, Bouldercreek, Helmer, Hobnail, Honeyjones, and Sly soils. Ahrs soils are on east and west-facing mountain slopes, and are very deep and loamy-skeletal. Bouldercreek and Honeyjones soils are on north-facing mountain slopes, and are ashy over loamy-skeletal. Helmer soils are on dissected terraces and have a fragipan at depths of 10 to 20 inches. Hobnail and Sly soils are on dissected terraces and foothills, and are very deep and have argillic horizons. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for timber production, livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed. The potential natural vegetation is mainly western hemlock, western redcedar, western white pine, grand fir, Douglas-fir, and western larch, with an understory of queencup beadlily, goldthread, longtube twinflower, myrtle pachystima, oneleaf foamflower, sweetscented bedstraw, starry false-Solomons-seal, big blueberry, and western rattlesnake plantain. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Idaho and northeastern Washington. MLRA 43A. This soil is moderately extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Benewah County, Idaho, 1975. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon -- the zone from 0 to 10 cm (Oi, Oe, A horizons) 
Cambic horizon -- the zone from 10 to 91 cm (Bw1, 2Bw2, 2BC horizons) 
Volcanic ash mantle -- the zone from 5 to 41 cm (A, Bw1 horizons) 
Particle-size control section -- the zone from 5 to 105 cm (A, Bw1, 2Bw2, 2BC, part of the 2C horizon) 

The ranges of values listed under the Range in Characteristics for the soil properties Bulk density, Volcanic glass content, Acid-oxalate Al +1/2 Fe, Phosphate retention and 15-bar water retention are estimates only. 

Lamella, when present, are less than 15 cm in cumulative thickness.
Diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral layer.

The mineralogy class was changed from paramicaceous to micaceous in 07/2010 by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the responsible MLRA regional office. The change was necessary based on the eleventh edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2010.
