Dietrich soils: have a sandy surface layer and are on a similar to slightly lower landform
Victine soils: have a surface with more than 30 percent clay and are on a slightly higher landform
Victoria soils: are clayey throughout and are on higher flats

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained.  Permeability is very slow.  Runoff is high. These soils are subject to flooding 1 to 5 times in 100 years.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing and wildlife land.  Native grasses are salt tolerant species such as gulf cordgrass, hartweg paspalum, seashore saltgrass, switchgrass, shoregrass, and buffalograss.  Woody invaders are mostly stunted mesquite, bushy sea-oxeye, and cactus.  A few local areas are used as pasture and planted to improved and introduced grasses.  The ecological site is Salty Prairie, PE 31-44 (R150BY551TX).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Gulf Coast Saline Prairies (MLRA 150B in LRR T) in the coastal area of southern Texas.  The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Aransas County, Texas, 1975.

REMARKS:  These soils were previously mapped as Willamar or saline phases of Orelia.  Texas Highway Department test reports indicate that plasticity index values are about 25 percent higher than normally expected in a smectitic mineralogy class.  This is assumed to be an effect of the high ESP of this soil.The classification was changed in 2014 as a result of characterization data.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle size control section: 14 to 64 cm (5 to 25 in). (Btn1,Btn2, Btkg	horizons) 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 14 cm (0 to 5 in). (A horizon)
Natric horizon: 14 to 203 cm (5 to 80 in). (Btn1, Btn2, Btkng1, Btkng2, Btkng3, Btkng4, and Btkng5 horizons)
