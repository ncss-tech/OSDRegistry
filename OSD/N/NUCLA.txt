NUCLA SERIES

The Nucla series consists of very deep well drained soils formed in calcareous alluvium or wind modified calcareous alluvium on ridge side slopes, terraces, and alluvial fans.  Nucla soils are on uplands and have slopes ranging from 0 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 33 centimeters (13 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 10 degrees C. (50 degrees F.) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Torriorthentic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Nucla loam on a southwest facing convex slope of 5 percent grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

  A1--0 to 10 centimeters (0 to 4 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) heavy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable; neutral (pH 6.7); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 23 centimeters (3 to 9 inches) thick)

  A2--10 to 20 centimeters (4 to 8 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) light clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate coarse subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable; slight effervescence; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 25 centimeters (4 to 10 inches) thick)

  Bw--20 to 36 centimeters (8 to 14 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) light clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate coarse subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 23 centimeters (3 to 9 inches) thick)

  Ck--36 to 152 centimeters (14 to 60 inches); very pale brown (10YR 7/3) light clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2)

TYPE LOCATION:  Weld County, Colorado; 488 meters (1,600 feet) north and 716 meters (2,350 feet) east of the SW corner of Sec. 26, T. 11 N., R. 57 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
These soils have a calcareous cambic horizon, or have a consistent horizon of visible secondary calcium carbonate.  
The mollic epipedon has moderate prismatic or blocky structure in the lower part and contains less carbonate than the C horizon.  
Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 0 to 25 centimeters (0 to 10 inches), but does not exceed one-half the thickness of the mollic epipedon and is not deeper than the upper boundary of the cambic horizon.  
Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent and are typically less than 5 percent. 
The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 10 to 12 degrees C. (50 to 53 degrees F.)  
Some pedons have a paralithic contact at 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches).

A horizon:
Hue: 5Y to 7.5YR
Value: 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 1 to 3
Reaction: neutral to moderately alkaline

Bw horizon:
Hue: 5Y to 7.5YR
Value: 5 to 7, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: typically light clay loam, but the clay increase is not large enough to qualify as an argillic horizon.  
Clay content: 18 to 35 percent
Silt content: 20 to 55 percent
Sand content: 20 to 55 percent with less than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand.  
Reaction: moderately alkaline

C horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR to 2.5Y
Reaction: moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Connerton(WY), Hightower(NM), Ralphston(NM), and Tarryall(CO) series.
Connerton soils have hue of 5YR or redder in a majority of sub-horizons. Hightower and Tarryall soils have a lithic contact at a depth of less than 40 inches.
Ralphston soils have more than 35 percent fine sand or coarser sand in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform: on uplands
Slopes: 0 to 25 percent
Parent material: thick, calcareous, medium and moderately fine textured materials derived predominantly from sedimentary rock
Average annual precipitation: 28 to 36 centimeters (11 to 14 inches) with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and early summer
Mean annual precipitation: up to 43 centimeters (17 inches)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ascalon, Curabith, and Platner soils.  
Ascalon soils have an argillic horizon.  
Curabith soils lack a cambic horizon and have a calcic horizon.  
Platner soils have a fine textured argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage: well drained
Runoff: medium or moderately rapid 
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: moderately high and high

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally for rangeland.  
There are small areas of irrigated or non-irrigated cropland.  
Native vegetation consists mainly of blue grama, snakeweed, prickly pear, and buffalograss.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Colorado and southeastern Wyoming.  The series is of moderate extent.
