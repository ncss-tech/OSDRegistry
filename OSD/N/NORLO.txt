NORLO SERIES

The Norlo series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in ash over colluvium from tuffs, basalts, rhyolites and mezozoic marine sediments on mountain sideslopes and benches.  Slopes are 5 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy over loamy-skeletal, glassy over isotic, frigid Alfic Humic Vitrixerands

TYPICAL PEDON:  Norlo gravelly ashy sandy loam, upland forest at an elevation of 5,600 feet, on a 25 percent north aspect, convex slope. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)
