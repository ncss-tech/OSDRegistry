NITER SERIES

The Niter series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from limestone, quartzite, sandstone, and tuff.  Niter soils are on hillslopes, lake terraces, fan remnants, and valley floors.  Slopes are 1 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Niter soils are on hillslopes,lake terraces, fan remnants, and valley floors.  These soils formed in lacustrine deposits derived from limestone, quartzite, sandstone, and tuff.  Slopes are 1 to 35 percent.  Elevations range from 1,490 to 2,180 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 500 mm, the mean annual air temperature is 2.2 to 7.2 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 60 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brifox, Iphil, Kucera, Lanoak, Rexburg, Ririe, and Watercanyon soils.  Kucera, Lanoak, Rexburg and Ririe soils have noncalcareous mollic epipedons.  Also, Kucera and Lanoak soils are pachic and Lanoak has a fine-silty textural section.  Watercanyon and Brifox soils lack mollic epipedons.  Iphil, Kucera, Rexburg, Ririe and Watercanyon soils have coarse-silty particle-size control sections.  Brifox, Iphil, Ririe and Watercanyon soils are on convex positions on hillslopes.  Kucera and Lanoak soils are on concave positions on hillslopes.  Rexburg soils are on less sloping areas on hilltops and footslopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to very high surface runoff; very slow permeability (low or moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity)

USE AND VEGETATION:  
Major uses--nonirrigated and irrigated cropland
Potential natural vegetation--basin big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass; sod-forming grasses

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho; small extent; MLRA 13

REMARKS:  
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are
Mollic epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to 30 cm (Ap1, Ap2, and Bk horizons)
Cambic horizon--the zone from 30 to 48 cm (Bss horizon)
Calcic horizon--the zone from 48 to 150 cm (Bkss2, Bkss3, and Bkss4 horizons)
Slickensides--the zone from 30 to 150 cm (Bkss1, Bkss2, Bkss3, and Bkss4 horizons)
Particle-size control section--the zone from 25 to 100 cm (Bkss1, Bkss2, and the Bkss3 horizons and part of the Bk horizon)

4/22/2018--Drainage class moved from moderately well to well drained based on field documentation. It was previously assumed that stratified lacustrine sediments seasonally perched water. However, no redoximorphic features, nor high water table has been documented in the field. Ksat and Hydrologic Soil Group remain unchanged.
