NAYTAHWAUSH SERIES

The Naytahwaush series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in glacial till on moraines.  Permeability is slow.  Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Oxyaquic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Naytahwaush loam with a convex slope of 3 percent on a glacial moraine in a deciduous forest.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 4 inches; black (10YR 2/1) loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine and medium roots; about 1 percent gravel; slightly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. (3 to 7 inches thick)

    E--4 to 8 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; moderate medium platy structure parting to weak fine subangular blocky; friable; common fine and medium roots; common black (10YR 2/1) streaks in root channels; about 1 percent gravel; moderately acid; abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt1--8 to 18 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) clay; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine angular blocky; very firm; common fine roots; many distinct very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay films on faces of peds and in pores; common black (10YR 2/1) streaks in root channels; about 1 percent gravel; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.

    Bt2--18 to 23 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silty clay loam; moderate fine prismatic structure parting to moderate fine angular blocky; firm; few fine roots; common very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay films on faces of peds and in pores; common black (10YR 2/1) streaks in root channels; about 3 percent gravel; neutral; clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of Bt horizon is 6 to 24 inches.)

    Btk--23 to 32 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silty clay loam; weak fine prismatic structure parting to weak fine angular blocky; firm; few fine roots; few faint dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay films on faces of peds; few very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) streaks in root channels; few carbonate masses and threads; about 4 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary. (0 to 24 inches thick)

    Bk--32 to 60 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) silty clay loam; massive; firm; common medium distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) Fe depletions; common carbonate threads and masses; about 4 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Mahnomen County, Minnesota; about 4 miles north of Naytahwaush; about 1625 feet south and 65 feet east of the northwest corner of Sec. 4, T. 144 N., R. 39 W.; USGS North Twin Lake Quadrangle, 47 degrees 19 minutes 10 seconds N., 95 degrees 38 minutes 11 seconds N.; NAD27

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 18 to 40 inches.  These soils contain 1 to 8 percent by volume of rock fragments of mixed lithology that are mostly gravel size. 

The A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loam, silt loam, clay loam or fine sandy loam.  This layer qualifies for a mollic epipedon except for thickness. Reaction is moderately acid through neutral.

The E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam.  Reaction is moderately acid through neutral. 

The Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 or 4. It is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam or clay loam. Subhorizons of sandy clay loam may be present.  The percent clay ranges from 35 to 60 percent.  Clay films are typically faint to distinct and common to continuous with chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.

The Btk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 or 4. It is clay, clay loam, silty clay or silty clay loam. Clay films are faint to distinct and few to common with chroma of 2 or 3. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.

The Bk or C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is clay loam or silty clay loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Naytahwaush soils are on nearly level to very steep convex slopes on glacial moraines.  The slope gradients range from 2 to 40 percent.  The soils primarily formed in calcareous, clay loam glacial till of Late Wisconsinan Age.  Field observations and lab data suggests there has been differential sorting (flow till) of this till from ice melting, accounting for the silty and clayey nature of the upper part of most pedons. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 43 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 25 inches.  Frost-free days range from 95 to 130.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 1100 to 1600 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Mahkonce, Auganaush, Cathro and Seelyeville soils.  The somewhat poorly drained Mahkonce soils are on nearly level areas, the poorly drained Auganaush soils are in swales, and the organic Cathro and Seelyeville soils are in depressions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained.  Surface runoff is low to very rapid.  Permeability is moderatley slow to slow.  Perched saturation occurs as high as 2 feet during the months of April to June in normal years.  The duration of saturation decreases as the slope class increases.  

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are in forest or pasture.  Some areas are cropped to small grain, hay, or row crops.  Native vegetation is alternate stages of prairie grasses and mixed hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA-57.  Northwestern Minnesota. Moderate extent.
