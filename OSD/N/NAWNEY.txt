TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, acid, thermic Typic Fluvaquents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Nawney silt loam - forested. (Colors are for moist soil.)

     Oi--0 to 4 inches; partially decomposed roots, leaves, and twigs and highly decomposed very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) organic material; many very fine and medium roots; very strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 8 inches thick)

     Ag--4 to 9 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) silt loam; few fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) masses of iron accumulation; weak fine granular structure; very friable; slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 15 inches thick)

     Cg1--9 to 47 inches; gray (10YR 6/1) loam; massive; friable; slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (36 to 72 inches thick)

     Cg2--47 to 64 inches; gray (10YR 6/1) stratified sand, loamy sand, and sandy loam; massive; slightly sticky, slightly plastic; strongly acid. 

TYPE LOCATION:  City of Virginia Beach, Virginia; about 3,200 feet south of junction of Princess Anne Road and Holland Road, or about 4,500 feet southwest of junction of Princess Anne Road and Seaboard Road.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The loamy horizons extend to a depth of 40 to 60 inches or more below the surface.  The soil ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid to about 40 inches and from extremely acid through slightly acid below about 40 inches.  Gravel-size rock fragments commonly make up 0 to 2 percent of the soil, but range to 15 percent below a depth of about 40 inches. Some pedons have one or more buried A horizons.

A horizon:
Color--hue of 7.5YR through 5Y or is netural, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 0 through 2.  Value of 3 or less is limited to horizons less than 6 inches thick.  Some pedons have high chroma masses of iron accumulation.  
Texture--comonly is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or silt loam but ranges to loamy sand, sandy clay loam, clay loam, and silty clay loam.
Redoximorphic features (if they occur)--iron masses in shades of brown, yellow, or red 

Cg horizon:
Color-- hue of 10YR through 5BG or is neutral, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 0 through 2
Texture--above about 40 inches commonly is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Pockets or strata of coarser or finer texture are in some pedons.  Below about 40 inches textures commonly are highly stratified and range from sand to clay. 
Redoximorphic features--iron masses in shades of brown, yellow, or red and iron depletions in shades of olive or gray

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  City of Virginia Beach, Virginia, 1981.  The name is from a nearby small creek.

REMARKS: 
1.  These areas have been included with higher order units, swamps, and mixed
    alluvial lands in past mapping.
2.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
     a. Ochric epipedon-the zone from the surface to 9 inches (O and A horizon)
     b. Fluventic feature-irregular decrease in organic matter 
     c. Fine-loamy particle size - weighted average clay content from 10 to 40 
        inches ranges from 18 to 34 percent.
     d. Acid family classification - the pH is less than 5.0 in 0.01 M calcium 
        chloride throughout the control section.
The soil horizon depths were revised on 10/2021 to ensure the soil description began at the soil surface.
