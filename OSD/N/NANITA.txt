NANITA SERIES

The Nanita series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and till derived from granitic rocks, gneiss, and schist.  Nanita soils are on moraines and glaciated mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Sandy-skeletal, mixed Lamellic Cryorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Nanita very gravelly sandy loam, on a north facing, convex, 52 percent slope in lodgepole pine at an elevation of 8,200 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on July 20, 1996 the soil was moist throughout.

The surface is covered by 15 percent stones, 5 percent boulders, and 10 percent cobbles.

    0e--0 to 1 inches; moderately decomposed forest litter. 

    E1--1 to 10 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common medium roots; 30 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt smooth boundary. 

    E2--10 to 23 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) extremely gravelly loamy sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine to medium roots; 40 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary.

(14 to 24 inches thick)

    E and Bt2--41 to 72 inches; 80 percent light gray (10YR 7/2) extremely gravelly sand, 20 percent grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist (E); few lamellae of yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely gravelly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist (Bt); weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; lamellae are discontinuous, nearly horizontal to diagonal, .2 to 1 cm thick and have a total thickness of 5.5 cm; 35 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones;  neutral (pH 6.6).  (16 to 36 inches thick)

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Comad(MT), Ovando(MT), and Rusbach(NM) series.   
Comad soils have rock fragment content that is dominantly greater than 10 inches in diameter. 
Ovando soils do border an ustic moisture regime.
Rusbach soils are typically dry in June and the soil and rock fragments are derived from tuff.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Catamount and Isolation series.  The Catamount soils have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 20 inches and are on structural benches.  The Isolation soils have a mollic epipedon and are on south-facing backslopes of moraines. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained, low to very rapid runoff, moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Recreation and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is lodgepole pine and Douglas-fir with an understory of common juniper, cliff jamesia, kinnikinnick, currant, and elk sedge.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Moraines of the north central Rocky Mountains, Colorado; LRR E, MLRA 48A; this series is of small extent.
