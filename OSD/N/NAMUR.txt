NAMUR SERIES

The Namur series consists of excessively drained soils which are very shallow to a lithic contact with dolostone. They formed in a very thin mantle of loess or loamy till underlain by dolostone on glaciated karst uplands.Slope ranges from 0 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 5.6 degrees C (42 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, active, frigid Lithic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Namur silt loam - on a 4 percent slope in a pasture at an elevation of about 213 meters (700 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 A--0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 inches); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; friable; many fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine and common medium tubular pores; few dolostone rock fragments mostly less than 1 inch in diameter but ranging to 4 inches; neutral; clear wavy boundary. [10 to 25 cm (4 to 10 inches) thick]

 R--15 cm (6 inches); dolostone; thinly bedded (1/2 to 2 inches) in upper 3 inches; few, narrow, widely spaced crevasses filled with silty clay loam and clay residuum occupy less than 5 percent of the horizon.

TYPE LOCATION: Brown County, Wisconsin; about 0.5 miles south and 1 mile west of Dyckesville; 2000 feet west and 250 feet north of the southeast corner of sec. 14, T. 25 N., R. 22 E.; USGS Dyckesville, Wis. Quad.; Latitude  44 degrees 38 minutes 0 seconds N. Longitude  87 degrees 47 minutes 28 seconds W. NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Thickness of the mollic epipedon: 10 to 25 cm (4 to 10 inches)
Depth to bedrock: 10 to 25 cm (4 to 10 inches)
Volume of dolostone channers: 3 to 35 percent
Reaction: slightly acid to moderately alkaline
Special features: Carbonates are in the loamy mantle in some pedons. 

A horizon:
Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 2 or 3
Chroma: 1 to 3
Texture: silt loam, loam or the channery analogues

Bw horizon (where present):
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 4 or 5
Texture: silt loam, loam or the channery analogues

The R horizon is dolostone and is either massive or bedded. 
Other features:
Typically it is interrupted at intervals along its surface by thin, vertical weathered cracks or joints. Cracks are more than 10 cm (4 inches) apart and commonly are 0.6 to 3.0 meters (2 to 10 feet) apart. These cracks are filled with soil (residuum, loess, or till) but occupy less than 5 percent of the volume.

COMPETING SERIES: These are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Namur soils are on glaciated karst uplands underlain by dolostone. Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent. These soils formed in a very thin silty or loamy mantle over the bedrock. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 838 mm (28 to 33 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 3.9 to 7.2 degrees C (39 to 45 degrees F). The frost-free period ranges from about 80 to 150 days. Elevation ranges from 187 to 427 meters (600 to 1400 feet).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Namur soils are associated with the Kolberg, Ruse, and Summerville soils. The well drained Kolberg soils are nearby where the soil has more clay and is moderately deep to dolostone. The poorly drained and very poorly drained Ruse soils are nearby in depressions where the soil is 25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 inches) thick to dolomite. The well drained Summerville soils are nearby in landscape positions similar to those of Namur soils where the soil is 25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 inches) thick to dolostone.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Excessively drained. The potential for surface runoff ranges from negligible to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the silty or loamy mantle and moderately low very high (0.42 to 141.14 micrometers per second) in the dolostone, depending on fracturing. Permeability is moderate in the silty or loamy mantle and slow to rapid in the dolostone, depending on fracturing.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of this soil are used for pastureland. Some areas are used for cropland or orchards. Where orchards are grown, the soil's effective depth often has been increased by blasting to a depth of several meters (feet). Native vegetation is sparse deciduous and coniferous forest with grassy understory.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 94A, and 95A in Northeastern Michigan and Wisconsin. The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Brown County, Wisconsin, 1970.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - 0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 inches) (A); lithic contact  at 15 cm (6 inches) (R).

Of the 25,698 acres correlated, a total of about 4000 acres correlated in Kewaunee, Brown and Outagamie counties are south of the mesic/frigid line.
