NEVADOR SERIES

The Nevador series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks, loess, and volcanic ash. Nevador soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Aladshi, Alley, Allor, Chime, Cleghorn, Glyphs, Igert, Mimentor, Qwynn, Wedertz, Wedlar, and Zevadez series. 

Aladshi soils have identifiable secondary carbonates in the argillic horizon, have subhorizons of the argillic which are gravelly, and have Bqk horizons which are firm and brittle when moist. Alley soils average 15 to 25 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Allor soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Chime soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts. Cleghorn soils have mean annual soil temperature of 10 to 13 degrees C. and have horizons which are firm and brittle when moist. Glyphs soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Igert soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts. Mimentor soils lack secondary carbonates within 100 cm.  Qwynn soils are moist for 10 to 20 days between July and September due to convection storms. Wedertz soils have albic horizons and horizons which are firm and brittle when moist. Wedlar soils have albic horizons, argillic horizons with bases deeper than 60 cm, gravelly substrata, and are intermittently moist during summer months. Zevadez soils have noneffervescent Bq horizons which are firm and brittle when moist. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nevador soils are on fan remnants. They typically occur on summit positions. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks, loess, and volcanic ash. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,375 to 1,955 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 70 to 120 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dacker, Dewar, Kelk, and Wiffo soils. Dacker soils are moderately deep to duripans. Dewar soils are loamy and shallow to duripans. Kelk soils are fine-silty and have cambic horizons. Wiffo soils are loamy-skeletal and do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium or high surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Nevador soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, spiny hopsage, needlegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Indian ricegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Nevada and southern Oregon. These soils are moderately extensive. MLRAs 23, 24 and 25. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California. 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Douglas County Area, Nevada, 1981. 

REMARKS: A prior revision moved the series type location from Washoe County to a more representative area in Elko County, Nevada. Field investigations determined that the Nevador soils correlated in the Surprise Valley-Home Camp Area, California-Nevada, where the prior typical pedon occurred, are ashy and glassy. Such soils are now within the range of the tentative Nevadash series. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 15 cm (A1 and A2 horizons). 
Argillic horizon - The zone from 15 to 61 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons). 
Identifiable secondary carbonates and durinodes - The zone from 61 to 155 cm (Bqk1, Bqk2, and Bqk3 horizons). 
Duric feature - The zone from 61 to 102 cm (part of the Bqk1 horizon). 
Particle-size control section - The zone from 18 to 61 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons). 

ADDITIONAL DATA: During the MLRA update the hardness of the durinodes should be evaluated to determine if fragments or parafragments. Durinodes must be weakly to moderately cemented and qualify as parafragments since they are not part of the texture modifier.  These textures should be revised to reflect the parafragment content in the Bqk horizons.
