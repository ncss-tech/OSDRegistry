NUKRUM SERIES

The Nukrum series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in calcareous clayey slope alluvium derived from claystone. These nearly level to gently sloping soils occur on footslopes and toeslopes of hillslopes on dissected plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, thermic Pachic Vertic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Nukrum silty clay - cropland.

Garvin soils: are moist in the soil moisture control section for longer periods, contain exchangeable sodium within the control section, and have an irregular decrease in organic matter with depth. 
Knippa and Rowena soils: have calcic horizons at depths of less than 102 cm (40 in) and have mixed mineralogy. 
Krum soils: are moist in the soil moisture control section for longer periods. 
Matoy soils: have a lithic contact with limestone between 20 and 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Rowena series, and the Frio, Leeray, Nuvalde, and Throck series. 
Frio soils: occur on lower flood plains and do not have vertic properties. 
Leeray soils: occur on similar to slightly lower positions and have intersecting slickensides and gilgai microrelief.
Nuvalde soils: occur on similar to slightly lower alluvial terraces, have a fine-silty particle-size control section, and do not have vertic properties.
Rowena soils: occur on similar to slightly lower alluvial terraces.
Throck soils: occur on higher positions, are less than 152 cm (60 in) to densic bedrock, and do not have a mollic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is slow. Runoff is medium on slopes less than 1 percent and high on 1 to 5 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for cropland, pastureland, and range. Small grains, forage sorghums, and grain sorghums are the main crops. Coastal bermudagrass and Kleingrass are the main pasture grasses. Native vegetation is mostly sideoats grama, Texas wintergrass, buffalograss, pricklypear, mesquite, and liveoak.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North-central Texas; LRR H - Central Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range Region; MLRA 78A - Rolling Limestone Prairie and MLRA 80B - Texas north-central prairies. The series is moderately extensive.

REMARKS: The Nukrum series was formerly included in the Krum or Rowena series.

11/1991 - Classification change from mixed mineralogy to smectitic mineralogy based on Texas A&M University laboratory samples from the series type location in Brown County and from type locations in Callahan and Mason Counties, Texas.

Edited 01/2017 (RFG & ROG):  Classification change from Vertic Haplustolls to Pachic Vertic Haplustolls based on historical range in characteristics and new class in Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Ninth Edition, 2003.
Changed to tabular format and included metric values.  Updated competing series, geographic setting, and associated soils sections. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Particle-size control section: 25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in) (A and Bw horizons) 
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 61 cm (0 to 24 in)(Ap and A horizons)
Cambic horizon: 61 to 142 cm (24 to 56 in)(Bw horizon).
Calcic horizon: 142 to 203 cm (56 to 80 in) (BCk horizon)
Vertic feature: the occurrence of dry weather cracks from 1 to 3 cm (0.4 to 1.2 in) wide that extend from the surface to more than 51 cm (20 in) in depth. The particle-size control section has 38 to 60 percent clay.
