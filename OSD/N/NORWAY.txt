NORWAY SERIES

The Norway series consists of very deep, poorly or very poorly drained soils formed in sandy alluvium. These soils are on plane to concave slopes in meander channels or low islands within the main river channel on floodplains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 500 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, mesic Typic Psammaquents

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 5 centimeters (A horizon);
