NASER SERIES

The Naser series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone, sandstone and shale. Naser soils occur on alluvial flats and fan skirts. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 250 mm. The mean annual air temperature is about 9.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, carbonatic, mesic Xeric Torrifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Naser silt loam, irrigated cropland. (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap--0 to 25 cm; pink (7.5YR 7/4) silt loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine and medium roots; few fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.7); abrupt smooth boundary. (20 to 30 cm thick)

    C1--25 to 82 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) silt loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine and medium roots; common fine and medium tubular pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 56 cm thick)

    C2--82 to 122 cm; pink (7.5YR 8/4) silt loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) silt loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine roots; few fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.9); clear wavy boundary. (18 to 46 cm thick)

    C3--122 to 152 cm; pink (7.5YR 7/4) silt loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0).

TYPE LOCATION: Sevier County, Utah; 1 3/4 mile west, 5/8 mile north of Salina; 2,330 feet south, 2,100 feet west of northeast corner of section 22, T.21S., R.1W.; USGS Aurora 7.5 minute quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 57 minutes 59 seconds N and longitude 111 degrees 53 minutes 45 seconds W; NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: Usually dry; moist in winter and spring and for brief periods in late summer due to convection storms; aridic bordering on xeric soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 9.0 to 12.0 degrees C.
Organic matter content: either decreases irregularly with depth or remains above 0.35 percent to a depth of 100 cm 
Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 18 to 27 percent
Calcium carbonate content: 40 to 60 percent
Sand content: averages less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser

A horizon  
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR.
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 through 4 dry.

C horizon
Hue: 10YR through 5YR.
Value: 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist.
Chroma: 2 through 6.
Texture: most commonly very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam; less commonly silty clay loam in individual strata.
Rock fragment content: 0 percent within 100 cm of the soil surface; some pedons have individual layers with 15 to 50 percent gravel below 100 cm in depth.

COMPETING SERIES: These are Quaker, Redfield, and Redview series. Quaker and Redview soils have 28 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Redfield and Redview soils have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Naser soils are at elevations of 1,550 to 1,740 meters. They occur on alluvial flats and fan skirts. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from limestone, sandstone and shale. The climate is semiarid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 200 to 300 mm. The mean annual air temperature is 8.0 to 10.5 degrees C. The mean summer temperature is 19.5 to 20.5 degrees C., and the freeze-free period ranges from 100 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Job, Lisade, and Sanpete soils. Job soils are are on flood plain steps under Kentucky bluegrass and sedges. Lisade soils have an accumulation of lime and are on fan skirts under Wyoming sagebrush.  Sanpete soils have an accumulation of lime and are on fan skirts under Wyoming sagebrush. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderate to moderately slow permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used principally for irrigated crops of alfalfa, small grains, corn, sugar beets and pasture, with limited livestock grazing. Native vegetation in big sagebrush, shadscale, horsebrush, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central and southern Utah; MLRA 28A. These soils are not extensive, with about 6,600 acres mapped to date.
