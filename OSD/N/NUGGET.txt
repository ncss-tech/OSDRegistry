NUGGET SERIES

The Nugget series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from granite, granodiorite, and quartzite. Nugget soils are on hills and mountains.  Slope ranges from 3 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic, shallow Aridic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Nugget sandy loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 80 to 100 percent of the surface is covered with gravel and cobble.

    A--0 to 1 inch; brown (7.5YR 4/3) sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; weak thin platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; few fine irregular pores; 10 percent gravel; noneffervescent; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick)

    Bt1--1 to 5 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; few fine tubular pores; few distinct clay films on ped faces and rock fragments; few distinct organic coatings on ped faces and rock fragments; 20 percent gravel; noneffervescent; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary.

    Bt2--5 to 12 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) gravelly sandy clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and medium angular blocky rock structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; many very fine and fine roots; few fine tubular pores; many distinct clay films on ped faces and rock fragments; few distinct organic coatings on ped faces and rock fragments; 25 percent gravel; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 10 to 20 inches.)

    Crt--12 to 17 inches; highly fractured decomposed granodiorite; extremely hard; many distinct clay films and distinct organic coatings on rock fragments; common very fine roots along fractures; abrupt wavy boundary.  

    Cr--17 to 24 inches; highly fractured decomposed granodiorite; extremely hard; few very fine roots along fractures; clear wavy boundary. 

    R--24 inches; unweathered granodiorite.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Nugget soils are in the Chihuahuan desert on hills and mountains at elevations of 4,000 to 6,200 feet.  Slope ranges from 3 to 60 percent.  These soils formed from slope alluvium and residuum derived from granite, granodiorite, and quartzite.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December and January.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 65 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 210 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Turquoise, Gardencan and Lanque soils.  Turquoise soils have less than 18 percent clay. The Gardencan and Lanque soils are very deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to very high runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation includes Texas bluestem, plains lovegrass, sideoats grama, beggartick threeawn, hairy grama, manzanita, bullgrass and Emory oak.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Arizona portion of the Chihuahuan desert. MLRAs are 38 and 41. Nugget soils are of moderate extent.
