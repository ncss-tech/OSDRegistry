NOMAZU SERIES

The Nomazu series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and alluvium derived from volcanic and tuffaceous sedimentary rocks.  Nomazu soils are on alluvial flats, inset fans, alluvial plains, fan skirts, and basin floor remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nomazu soils are on alluvial flats, inset fans, alluvial plains, fan skirts, and basin floor remnants.  These soils formed in volcanic ash and alluvium derived from volcanic and tuffaceous sedimentary rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations range from 1,365 to 1,750 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Macnot soil.  Macnot soils are ashy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; very low or low surface runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Nomazu soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly shadscale, bud sagebrush, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Nevada and northeastern California.  These soils are not extensive with about 4,000 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 23.
