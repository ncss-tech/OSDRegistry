NILLO SERIES

The Nillo series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils on ephemeral stream floodplains. These nearly level soils formed in Holocene-age alluvium derived mainly from tuff of the Duff and Pruett Formations. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm (13inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18.3 degees C (65 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Crowflats (NM) and Riveroad (AZ) series. Crowflats and Riveroad soils have exchangeable sodium percentage less than 15 percent and do not have buried horizons. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nillo soils are on ephemeral stream  Holocene-age floodplains of ephemeral streams. They are associated with channels that receive overbank floodwaters once in 7 to 20 years for a duration of less than 2 days. Nillo soils formed in stratified loamy and clayey alluvium derived from tuffaceous rocks of the Duff and Pruett Formations. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 305 to 380 mm (12 to 14 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 16.7 to 19.4 degrees C (62 to 68 degrees F). Frost-free period ranges from 210 to 260 days, and elevation ranges from 1,070 to 1,525 m (3,500 to 5,000 feet).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Gemelo and Straddlebug soils. Gemelo soils have less than 18 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section. They are on late-Holocene fan aprons. Straddlebug soils have between 18 and 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser fine sand in the particle-size control section. They are on alluvial flats and stream terraces that do not receive overbank floodwaters because stream channels are large enough to transport peak flows. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is slow. Runoff is medium on 0 to 1 percent slopes, and high on 1 to 2 percent slopes. 

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Woody species consist of creosotebush, tarbush, and western honey mesquite. Grasses in the understory include giant sacaton, sideoats grama, alkali sacaton, tobosa grass, blue grama, plains bristlegrass, cane bluestem, Arizona cottontop, and vine mesquite. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: LRR-D, MLRA 42, Southern Desertic Basins, Plains, and Mountains, Desert Grassland LRU.  Far West Texas. MLRA 42. The soil is of minor extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Presidio County, Texas, 1997. The name is coined. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 8 cm (0 to 3 inches) (A horizon) 

Buried soil - the zone from 66 to 200 cm (26 to 80 inches) (Ab, Bwb1, Bwb2, Bkwb1, and Bkb2 horizons) 

Cambic horizon - the zone from 81 to 200 cm (32 to 80 inches) (Bwb and Bkb horizons) 

Ustic feature - the soil has an aridic moisture regime that borders the ustic moisture regime. 

Fluventic feature - the soil has an irregular decrease in organic carbon content with depth. 

Superactive cation activity class - CEC to percent clay ratio is 0.60 or greater. This is assumed from the abundant zeolitic minerals in the Duff and Pruett Tuffs.
