NAVAJITA SERIES

The Navajita series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed from slope alluvium derived from rhyolitic tuff.  Navajita soils are on north-facing footslopes and toeslopes of valley sides.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Navajita soils are on north-facing footslopes and toeslopes of valley sides.  They formed from slope alluvium derived from rhyolitic tuff of the Quaternary age Bandelier Tuff formation.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,800 to 6,900 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Piojillo, Totavi, and Zacaton soils.  Piojillo soils are ashy, do not have argillic horizons, and are on south facing footslopes of valley sides.  Totavi soils are ashy, do not have argillic horizons, and are on valley floors.  Zacaton soils are ashy-skeletal, do not have argillic horizons, and are on north-facing backslopes of mesas.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium surface runoff; moderate permeability 

USE AND VEGETATION: Navajita soils are used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed.  The historic climax vegetation is twoneedle pinyon, oneseed juniper, muttongrass, and blue grama.  The ecological site is Juniperus monosperma-Pinus edulis/Fallugia paradoxa-Chrysothamnus nauseosus/Bouteloua hirsuta-Bouteloua gracilis(F036XB136NM).
 
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Navajita soils are of moderate extent on the southwestern Espanola Basin part of the Basin and Range province in northcentral New Mexico. The MLRA is 36.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Santa Fe County, New Mexico; Santa Fe Area Soil Survey Update, 2008. Navajita is a coined name. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from the surface to a depth of about 2 inches. (A horizon)

Argillic horizon - The zone from 8 inches to a depth of about 57 inches. (Bt1, Bt2, Btk1, and Btk2 horizons)

Particle-size control section - The zone from 8 to 28 inches (Bt1 and part of the Bt2 horizon)

Series control section - The zone from 0 to 60 inches.

Note: This soil has moderate amounts of volcanic glass in the coarse silt plus sand fractions.  It has less volcanic ash than other nearby less developed soils because of the influence of introduced slope alluvium. Even though lower horizons contain more glass than upper horizons, it does not contain enough glass to make a Vitritorrandic subgroup.
