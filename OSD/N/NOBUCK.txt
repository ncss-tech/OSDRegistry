NOBUCK SERIES

The Nobuck series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from mixed volcanic rocks.  The Nobuck soils are on mountain side slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

Elevations are 1,590 to 2,135 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with hot, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm; mean annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Punchbowl and Locane series.  Punchbowl and Locane soils have a lithic contact within 50 cm.
