NOMARA SERIES

The Nomara series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from argillite, slate, andesite, quartzite, and limestone.  Nomara soils are on side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Pachic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Nomara silt loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 10 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak very thin platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel, 3 percent cobbles and 1 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (5 to 13 cm thick)

    A2--10 to 25 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 15 cm thick)

    A3--25 to 48 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (10 to 23 cm thick)

       Bt--48 to 86 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine interstitial and tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 40 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt wavy boundary.  (20 to 38 cm thick)

    Btk--86 to 100 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; very hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; common faint clay films lining pores; many medium soft masses of carbonate; violently effervescent; 60 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt irregular boundary. (8 to 25 cm thick)

    2R--100 cm; fractured argillite with carbonates coating fractures.

TYPE LOCATION:  Humboldt County, Nevada; approximately 4 miles southeast of Winnemucca, about 1,600 feet north and 2,400 feet east of the southwest corner of section 12, T. 35 N., R. 38 E.; USGS Winnemucca East 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 54 minutes 59 seconds N and longitude 117 degrees 39 minutes 10 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.9163889 latitude, -117.6527778 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist in winter and spring, dry from July through September; xeric soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 4 to 8 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness; 50 to 90 cm.
Depth to bedrock: 50 to 100 cm.
Depth to carbonates: 43 to 90 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  20 to 35 percent.

A horizon
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 through 4 moist.
Chroma: 1 through 4.

Bt horizons
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 2 through 4 moist.
Texture:  Very gravelly silt loam, very gravelly loam, or extremely gravelly clay loam.
Consistence:  Hard or very hard, dry.
Reaction:  Slightly alkaline in upper part, moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline in the lower part.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Demner and Rypod series.  

Demner and Rypod soils are very deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nomara soils are on side slopes of mountains. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from argillite, slate, andesite, quartzite, and limestone with some influence from loess.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 1,680 to 2,320 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Gosumi and Sumine series.  Gosumi soils are 100 to 150 cm deep to bedrock, lack secondary carbonates within 107 cm, and have 35 to 50 percent clay in the particle-size  control section.  Sumine soils have a mollic epipedon that is 20 to 38 cm thick and are noneffervescent in their profiles.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; rapid or very rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, snowberry, Idaho fescue, and bluebunch wheatgrass

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 24.
