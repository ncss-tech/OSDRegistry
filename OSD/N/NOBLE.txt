NOBLE SERIES

The Noble series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in colluvium or alluvium from the Permian redbeds.  These nearly level to steep soils formed in footslopes of uplands in the Northern Cross Timbers (MLRA 84A).  Slope ranges from 1 to 30 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 16.1 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 864 mm (34 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, siliceous, active, thermic Udic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Noble fine sandy loam-cultivated, at an elevation of 396 m (1300 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     Ap--0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 in); reddish brown (5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; many fine roots; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (Thickness of the A horizon is 10 to 51 cm [4 to 20 in])

     Bw--18 to 71 cm (7 to 28 in); reddish brown (5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; common fine roots; many fine pores; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (Thickness of the Bw horizon is 25 to 102 cm [10 to 40 in])

     C--71 to 183 cm (28 to 72 in); red (2.5YR 4/6) fine sandy loam, dark red (2.5YR 3/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable; common fine roots; many fine pores; slightly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Caddo County, Oklahoma; about 1 mile north and 6 miles east of Gracemont; 1,500 feet east and 900 feet south of the northwest corner of sec. 4, T. 8 N., R. 9 W.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Soils in similar families are the Amber, Apalo, Canadian, Crisfield, Darnell, Dill, Gomez, Hardeman, Hext, Mobeetie, Paluxy, Shrewder, Slaughterville, and Spade series.  
Amber and Apalo soils: have coarse-silty control sections and mixed mineralogy  
Canadian, Crisfield, and Slaughterville soils: have mixed mineralogy and a mollic epipedon  
Darnell soils: are 25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 in) to sandstone bedrock
Dill, Paluxy, and Shrewder soils: have mixed mineralogy, in addition, Dill and Shrewder soils occur in a dryer climate  
Gomez, Hardeman, Hext, Mobeetie, and Spade soils: have mixed mineralogy and soft secondary lime within 71 cm (28 in) of the soil surface

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: formed in material weathered from local alluvium or colluvium from sandstone of Permian age
Landscape: uplands
Landform: nearly level to steep footslopes and lower side slopes
Slope: 1 to 30 percent
Mean annual air temperature: 15 to 17.2 degrees C (59 to 63 degrees F)  
Mean annual precipitation:  787 to 940 mm (31 to 37 in)
Frost free period: 181 to 240 days
Elevation: 320 to 457 m (1050 to 1500 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Darnell, Harrah, Littleaxe, Newalla, Stephenville, and Zaneis.
Darnell soils: on ridges.
Harrah, Littleaxe, Stephenville, and Zaneis soils: are on higher positions
Teller soils: are on lower stream terraces 
Harrah, Littleaxe, and Stephenville soils: have a fine-loamy control section 
Newalla soils: are on higher positions and have a fine-loamy over clayey control section
Teller and Zaneis soils: have a mollic epipedon, mixed mineralogy, and have a fine-loamy control section

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  
Drainage: Well drained
Permeability: moderately rapid
Runoff: negligible on 1 to 3 percent slopes, very low on 3 to 5 percent slopes, low on 5 to 10 percent slopes, medium on 10 to 20 percent slopes and high on slopes greater than 20 percent

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly cultivated.  Small grains, grain sorghums, and cotton are the principal crops.  Some areas are used for tame pasture or rangeland.  Native vegetation is post oak and blackjack oak with an understory of tall grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  LRR-J; Northern Cross Timbers (MLRA 84A) of Central Oklahoma, possibly north-central Texas and south-central Kansas.  The series is moderately extensive.
