NOMAD SERIES

The Nomad series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material derived from sandstone over residuum derived from the Greenhorn limestone member of the Mancos Shale formation.  Nomad soils are on structural benches.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, carbonatic, mesic Typic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Nomad loamy sand, on a southeast facing, 2 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 4,940 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The surface is covered by 20 percent sandstone gravel.

    Bw1--2 to 7 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate very fine granular; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots throughout; common very fine dendritic tubular pores; 41 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 1 percent sandstone gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary.

    Bw2--7 to 14 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots throughout; common very fine and few fine dendritic tubular pores; 45 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 1 percent sandstone gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.

    2Bk--14 to 21 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, extremely firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots throughout; common very fine dendritic tubular pores; common medium irregular masses of carbonate and finely disseminated carbonates throughout; 58 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 1 percent limestone parachanners; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.

    2C--21 to 30 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) clay, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots throughout; many very fine dendritic tubular pores; disseminated carbonates throughout; 50 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 1 percent limestone parachanners; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.

    2Cr1--30 to 39 inches; highly fractured soft Greenhorn limestone; clear wavy boundary.

    2Cr2--39 to 55 inches; fractured soft Greenhorn limestone.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Greycap and Hope series. Greycap soils are shallow or very shallow to limestone and are on structural benches. Hope soils are very deep and are in broad drainageways. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, low or medium runoff, slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Nomad soils are used for rangeland.  Native vegetation is winterfat, galleta, shadscale, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Montezuma County, Colorado, Ute Mountain Indian Reservation.  MLRA 35.  This series is of small extent.

Ochric epipedon: The zone from 0 to 10 inches.  (A and BA horizons)

Calcic horizon: The zone from 14 to 21 inches.  (2Bk horizon)

Paralithic contact: The contact with soft limestone at 30 inches.  (2Cr1 and 2Cr2 horizons)

Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Ninth Edition, 2003

ADDITIONAL DATA: Calcium carbonate equivalence was determined using a field volume calcimeter.  A HACH kit was used to determine gypsum concentrations.  Electrical conductivity was determined with a portable EC meter.
