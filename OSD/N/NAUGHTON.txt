NAUGHTON SERIES

The Naughton series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from shale. These soils are on hillslopes and cuestas. Slopes are 1 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 450 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 1.2 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic Typic Haplocryerts

TYPICAL PEDON: Naughton silty clay loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

 A--0 to 8 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, very firm, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few fine and many very fine roots throughout; many very fine tubular pores; 9 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 10 cm thick) 

 Btss1--8 to 60 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong coarse angular blocky structure; extremely hard, slightly rigid, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few medium and many very fine roots throughout; few fine and many very fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; 15 percent slickensides and 60 percent clay films on all faces of peds; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.

 Btss2--60 to 80 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong coarse angular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky, very plastic; common very fine roots throughout; few very fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; 20 percent slickensides and 60 percent clay films on all faces of peds; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (combined thickness of Btss horizons is 9 to 72 cm)

 Btkss--80 to 122 cm; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; strong coarse angular blocky structure; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky, very plastic; few very fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; 50 percent slickensides and 30 percent clay films on all faces of peds;  5 percent calcium carbonate masses in matrix; strongly effervescent; 8 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (32 to 55 cm thick) 

 C--122 to 200 cm; gray (2.5Y 6/1) silty clay loam, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) moist; massive; very hard, very firm, very sticky, very plastic; few very fine tubular pores; 20 percent paragravel; 40 percent pressure faces on all faces of peds; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).
