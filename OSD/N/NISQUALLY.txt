NISQUALLY SERIES

The Nisqually series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in glacial outwash. Nisqually soils are on terraces with slopes of 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1,270 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, isotic, mesic Pachic Humixerepts 

TYPICAL PEDON: Nisqually loamy fine sand - cultivated. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.) 

   Ap--0 to 13 cm; black (5YR 2/1) loamy fine sand, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; massive; soft, very friable; many medium and fine roots; very high in organic matter leaving a sooty stain on fingers; moderately acid (pH 5.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (13 to 15 cm thick) 

   A1--13 to 46 cm; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) loamy fine sand, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; massive; soft, very friable; common medium and fine roots; high in organic matter; moderately acid (pH 5.8); gradual wavy boundary. (25 to 41 cm thick) 

   A2--46 to 79 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loamy fine sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; massive; soft, very friable; common medium fine roots; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary. (25 to 41 cm thick) 

   2Cl--79 to 122 cm; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) loamy sand, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) dry; massive; soft, very friable; common medium, fine roots; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual wavy boundary. (38 to 56 cm thick) 

   2C2--122 to 150 cm; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) loamy sand, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2); single grained; loose; few medium and fine roots; slightly acid (pH 6.4). 

TYPE LOCATION: Thurston County, Washington; 8 km south of Olympia, about 213 meters east and 107 meters south of the northwest corner of section 13, T. 17 N., R. 2 W.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nisqually soils are on terraces at elevations 15 to 122 meters. The soils formed in glacial outwash with slopes of 0 to 15 percent. These soils are in a mild marine climate with a mean annual precipitation of 1,000 to 1,050 mm most of which falls as rain in November through April. The mean January temperature is about 2 degrees C.; the mean July temperature is about 18 degrees C.; the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.; and the frost-free season is 150 to 180 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Indianola, Norma, and Spanaway soils. Indianola soils lack an umbric epipedon and are on hills, terrace escarpments, eskers and kames. Norma soils have an aquic moisture regime and are in depressions on glacial till plains and drainageways. Spanaway soils are sandy-skeletal and are on terraces and plains. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; very slow runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for irrigated cropland and dryland pasture. Native vegetation was a prairie with a cover of grasses, ferns, and mosses. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Washington, MLRA 2. This series is moderately extensive. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Pierce County, Washington, 1945. 

REMARKS: Classification changed in 8/2011 from sandy, isotic, mesic Vitrandic Dystroxerepts to sandy, isotic mesic Pachic Humixerepts based on laboratory data and lacking volcanic glass content in these soils to meet Vitrandic subgroup.

Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this soil: 
Umbric epipedon - 0 to 79 cm  
Soil moisture regime - xeric
