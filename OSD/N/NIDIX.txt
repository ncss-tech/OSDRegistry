NIDIX SERIES

The Nidix series consists of moderately deep well drained soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from sandstone.  These soils are on hillslopes. Slopes are 10 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 33 centimeters (13 inches).  The average annual temperature is about 8 degrees C. (47 degrees F.) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Nidix very cobbly sandy loam is on a north facing slope of 42 percent, utilized as rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  A--0 to 20 centimeters (0 to 8 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) very cobbly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine, and few medium roots; 25 percent gravel and 30 percent cobble; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary. (13 to 25 centimeters (5 to 10 inches) thick)

  Bw--20 to 51 centimeters (8 to 20 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 25 percent gravel and 30 percent cobble; neutral (pH 7.3); gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 38 centimeters (0 to 15 inches) thick)

  C--51 to 76 centimeters (20 to 30 inches);  pale brown (10YR 6/3) cobbly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic;  few very fine, fine and medium roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores;  10 percent gravel and 10 percent cobble;  neutral (pH 7.3); clear wavy boundary.

  Cr--76 to 102 centimeters (30 to 40 inches); weakly consolidated sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION:  Platte County, Wyoming; 503 centimeters (1650 feet) west and 183 centimeters (600 feet) north of the southeast corner of section 20, T. 25 N., R. 67 W.  Wheatland Quadrangle, 42 degrees 7 minutes 11 seconds north latitude and 104 degrees 54 minutes 48 seconds west longitude.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform: footslopes and lower backslopes of hills
Parent material: alluvial and colluvial deposits derived dominantly from sandstone
Slopes: 10 to 60 percent
Elevations: 1372 to 1768 centimeters (4500 to 5800 feet)
Average annual precipitation: 30 to 38 centimeters (12 to 15 inches)
Average annual temperature: 8 to 9 degrees C. (46 to 48 degrees F.)  
Frost free period is 110 to 130 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Clapper, Curabeth, Keeline, and Taluce soils.  
Clapper, Curabeth, and Keeline soils are very deep and occur on lower toeslopes and valley floors.  
Taluce soils are shallow and occur on upper backslopes and shoulders.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage: well drained
Runoff: rapid 
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: high

USE AND VEGETATION:  Nidix soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  
The native vegetation is dominantly western wheatgrass, little bluestem, and needleandthread.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Nidix soils occur in eastern Wyoming.  This series is of limited extent.
