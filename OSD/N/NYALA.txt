NYALA SERIES

The Nyala series consist of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff, shale, and limestone. Nyala soils are on fan remnants, fan skirts, and alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C.

Caudle soils have 0 to 5 percent rock fragments and less than 50 percent sand in the particle-size control section. Tocan soils do not have identifiable secondary carbonates in the argillic horizon and have 20 to 28 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Unsel soils have 15 to 30 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and have very gravelly or extremely gravelly horizons in the lower part of the substratum. Vigus soils lack identifiable secondary carbonates in the argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nyala soils are on fan remnants, fan skirts, and alluvial fans. They formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff, shale, and limestone. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,457 to 1,645 meters. The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 14 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 120 to 140 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Fang and Kawich soils. Fang soils are coarse-loamy, do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons, and occur on adjacent fan skirts and inset fans. Kawich soils are sandy and occur on dunes. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium to high surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Nyala soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is mainly galleta, bud sagebrush, shadscale, winterfat, fourwing saltbush, and Indian ricegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central and southern Nevada. These soils are not extensive with about 4,500 acres of the series mapped to date. MLRAs 28B and 29.
