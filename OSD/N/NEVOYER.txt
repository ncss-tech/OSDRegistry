NEVOYER SERIES

The Nevoyer series consists of very shallow and shallow to indurated duripan, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from welded tuff with a component of volcanic ash. Nevoyer soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Xeric Haplodurids

TYPICAL PEDON: Nevoyer gravelly fine sandy loam - rangeland (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered with approximately 45 percent gravel.

(10 to 20 cm thick) 

 Bqk--25 to 43 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) cobbly fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; few very fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; common (2 percent) distinct secondary calcium carbonate and silica concretions around rock fragments, violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (5 to 18 cm thick) 

 Bqkm--43 to 46 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) cemented material, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) secondary silica concretions; massive; extremely hard, extremely firm; indurated duripan; violently effervescent; very abrupt wavy boundary (0.6 to 5 cm thick) 

 R--46 cm; hard welded tuff.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nevoyer soils are on hills and mountains at elevations of 1,370 to 2,130 meters. Slopes range from 4 to 50 percent. The soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from welded tuff with a component of volcanic ash. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm. The mean annual temperature about 10 to 14 degrees C and the frost-free period 120 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Leo, Tickapoo, and Specter series. Leo soils have sandy-skeletal control sections and are more than 50 cm deep. Specter soils have indurated duripans and loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections. Tickapoo soils have sandy clay loam argillic horizons overlying duripans. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium to high runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Nevoyer soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Potential native vegetation is mainly black sagebrush, littleleaf horsebrush, galleta, Nevada ephedra, and a trace of shadscale and Indian ricegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central and south eastern Nevada. The series is not extensive. MLRA 29.
