GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Needahoe soils are on plateaus.  They typically occur on summit positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rock such as andesite with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 2,400 to 2,600 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 35o to 40o mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Mopana and Uawda soils.  Mopana soils have duripans within 50 cm of the soil surface, have an aridic moisture regime, and have an abrupt increase in clay in the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Uawda soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the particle-size control section, do not have duripans, and have paralithic contacts within 100 cm of the soil surface.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained; Episaturation is present with a perched seasonal high water table between 25 and 64 centimeters (shallow or moderately deep free water occurrence classes) between March and May.  Cumulative annual duration class is very transitory and anaerobic conditions are not present; low surface runoff; very slow permeability low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Needahoe soils are used for rangeland, recreation, watershed, and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is mainly silver sagebrush, mountain big sagebrush, and western needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern California and western Nevada, in the western part of the Great Basin.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 26.
