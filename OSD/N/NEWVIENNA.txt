REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 18 to 68 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and Bt4 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (Ap, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, Btg, and Cg horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 18 centimeters (Ap horizon);
argillic horizon--the zone from 18 to 107 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, and Btg horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Mollic Oxyaquic subgroup based on colors of ochric epipedon and a zone of saturation within 100 centimeters for 20 or more consecutive days or 30 or more cumulative days in normal years.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

These soils have been included in the Exette and Downs mapunits in previous soil surveys.

Saturation data is available in the Dubuque County Soil Survey field notes at Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa.
