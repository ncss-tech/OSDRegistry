NIVEAN SERIES

The Nivean series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum from welded tuff or rhyolite. These soils are on mountains, hills and ridges. Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Nivean very cobbly loam, in non-stocked forest (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A1--0 to 2 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) very cobbly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak very fine and fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; 20 percent cobbles and 15 percent pebbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.

    A2--2 to 7 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate very fine and fine granular; slightly  hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots and few coarse roots; 10 percent cobbles and 30 percent pebbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of A horizons is 6 to 10 inches.)

    Bw--7 to 13 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots and few medium roots; many medium tubular pores; 5 percent cobbles and 35 percent pebbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick)

    Cr--13 to 18 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) semi- consolidated welded tuff. (2 to 6 inches thick)

    R--18 inches; light gray (5Y 7/1) fractured hard welded tuff bedrock.

USE AND VEGETATION: Nivean soils are mainly used for woodland, rangeland, watershed, and as wildlife habitat.  The potential native vegetation is mainly lodgepole pine, Douglas-fir, Rocky Mountain juniper, Oregongrape, common snowberry, bitterbrush, quaking aspen, bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, sandberg bluegrass, tufted hairgrass, lupine and rose.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Nivean soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Jefferson County, Montana, 1998; proposed in Deer Lodge County, Montana, 1996.

REMARKS:   Soil interpretive record: MT1752, MT3234.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: a mollic epipedon from the surface to 13 inches (A1, A2, Bw horizons); a particle size control section from the surface to 13 inches (A and Bw horizons); a layer of decomposing welded tuff from 13 to 18 inches (Cr horizon); welded tuff bedrock at 18 inches (R horizon).  Nivean soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
