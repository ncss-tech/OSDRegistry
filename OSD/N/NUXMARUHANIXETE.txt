NUXMARUHANIXETE SERIES

The Nuxmaruhanixete series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in silty alluvium and in loamy alluvium and in the underlying sandy outwash.  These soils are on strath terraces.  Permeability is moderate in the silty alluvium, moderate or moderately slow in the loamy alluvium, and rapid or very rapid in the sandy outwash.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Argiudolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Nuxmaruhanixete silt loam on a convex, northwest-facing slope of 4 percent, in a cultivated field, at an elevation of 725 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) About 5 percent of the surface is covered by rock fragments, 4 percent by gravel, and 1 percent by cobbles.  The fragments are igneous.

    2Bt4--45 to 52 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) very gravelly sandy loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few very fine roots; common distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; about 40 percent gravel and 1 percent cobbles; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of 2Bt horizons is 15 to 30 inches)

    3BC--52 to 60 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) gravelly loamy sand; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; about 25 percent gravel; slightly acid.

The Marbletown and Sibleyville soils have a paralithic contact in the series control section.
Burchard, Cakato, Griswold, Kishwaukee, Parmod, Reedslake, Ringwood, Shelby, Velma and Wyanet soils have carbonates in the series control section.
Cresent, Friesland, Jasper, Joslin, and Penfield soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Elevation: 710 to 750 feet
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 48 to 52 degrees F
Mean Annual Precipitation: 30 to 34 inches
Frost Free Period: 135 to 165 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
These are the Balmoral and Muscoda soils near the Type Location.  These soils are in similar positions on the landscape.  The Muscoda soils have more sand in the upper part and have a paralithic contact with the bedrock. The Balmoral soils are moderately well drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage: Well drained
Permeability: Moderate in the silty alluvium, moderate or moderately slow in
the loamy alluvium, and rapid or very rapid in the sandy outwash
Runoff: Low to medium

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of areas of Nuxmaruhanixete soils are used for cropland.  Corn, soybeans, small grain, and hay are the principal crops.  A few small areas remain in native vegetation or are used for pastureland.  Native vegetation is a mixture of deciduous forest and prairie grasses with scattered oak trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwestern Wisconsin.  MLRA 105.  This series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES PROPOSED: Richland County, Wisconsin, 2002.  Source of the name was
provided by Elder, Jim Funmaker, of the Ho-Chunk Nation.  It is pronounced nuxch ma ro' ha ni-xute' and means ice-land-moving river in the Ho-Chunk language.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon: The zone from 0 to 11 inches.
Argillic horizon: The zone from 14 to 52 inches. 

This series is on a strath terrace along the Wisconsin River where the depth to a paralithic contact of glaconitic sandstone is 60 inches or more.

An Abstract titled, Geology of the Pre-Illinoian Sediment in the Bridgeport Terrace, Lower Wisconsin River Valley, Wisconsin by James C. Knox and John W. Attig explains the sediments found over a rock bench.  It is thought to be a pre-Illinoian sediment with an eastward-sloping depositional surface.  This was laid down when the flow of the Wisconsin River was to the east as a result from an ice blockage along the Mississippi River.
