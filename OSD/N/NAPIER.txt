NAPIER SERIES

The Napier series consists of very deep, well drained soils on foot slopes, upland drainageways, and alluvial fans. These soils formed in local colluvium and alluvium derived from loess. Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 790 millimeters.

The Napier and Worthen series are currently separated on a geographic basis. Differences in morphology, if any, are not known. The Lindstrom, Huntsville, and Worthen series need further study to aid in differentiation.
