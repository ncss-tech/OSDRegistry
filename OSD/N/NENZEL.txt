NENZEL SERIES

The Nenzel series consists of very deep moderately well drained soils that formed in mostly eolian sands on interdunes on sandhills. Some areas formed in alluvial sands on stream terraces on valleys. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 46 centimeters (18 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C. (47 degrees F.) at the type location. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Oxyaquic Haplustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Nenzel loamy fine sand on a 2 percent convex northwest facing slope in native grass. When described, the soil was moist throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.) 

	A1--0 to 13 centimeters (0 to 5 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loamy fine sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak very fine and fine granular structure; soft very friable; many very fine and fine roots throughout; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. 

	A2--13 to 46 centimeters (5 to 18 inches); dark gray (10YR 4/1) loamy fine sand, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak very fine and fine granular; soft, very friable; many very fine and fine roots throughout; neutral; clear smooth boundary. [Combined A horizon 25 to 91 centimeters (10 to 36 inches) thick] 

	AC--46 to 84 centimeters (18 to 33 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) loamy fine sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; soft, very friable; common very fine and fine roots throughout; neutral; clear smooth boundary. [0 to 41 centimeters (0 to 16 inches) thick]

	Cg1--84 to 137 centimeters (33 to 54 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; single grain; loose; common fine and medium prominent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6)moist, iron masses in the matrix; few very fine and fine roots throughout; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. 

	Cg2--137 to 200 centimeters (54 to 80 inches); light gray (2.5Y 7/2) fine sand, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) moist; single grain; loose; common fine and medium prominent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) moist, iron masses in the matrix; few very fine and fine roots in upper part; slightly alkaline. 

TYPE LOCATION: Cherry county, Nebraska; about 29 kilometers (18 miles) south and 3 kilometers (2 miles) west of Merriman; 427 meters (1400 feet) south and 579 meters (1900 feet) east of the northwest corner, sec. 14, T. 31 N., R. 38 W. Wild Mare Lake USGS quad; lat. 42 degrees, 40 minutes, 13 seconds N. and long. 101 degrees, 44 minutes, 46 seconds W., NAD 83

Depth to endosaturation: 91 to 183 centimeters (36 to 72 inches) 
Particle-size control section (weighted average): 
	Clay content: 1 to 10 percent 
	Sand content: 78 to 99 percent
A horizon: 
Hue: 10YR

some pedons have thin layers of darker colored, finer textured, or gravelly material below a depth of 102 centimeters (40 inches). 
Reaction: neutral to slightly alkaline 

COMPETING SERIES: This is Willowbrook series.
The Willowbrook soils have a higher mean annual temperature and more mean annual
precipitation and typically have coarse-loamy solums.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: mostly eolian sands when on interdunes on sandhills, some alluvial sands when on stream terraces on valleys

Landscape: mostly sandhills, some stream valleys
Landform: mostly swales and hummocks on interdunes, some stream terraces
Slope: 0 to 3 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 41 to 64 centimeters (16 to 25 inches) 
Mean annual temperature: 8 to 10 degrees C. (46 to 50 degrees F.) 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Elsmere, Ipage, Libory, Loup, and Valentine soils. 
Elsmere soils are slightly lower on swales on interdunes and are somewhat poorly drained having a seasonal zone of saturation or aquic conditions beginning at 46 centimeters (18 inches). 
Ipage soils are on similar hummocks on interdunes but lack mollic epipedons.
Libory soils are on similar swales on interdunes and are sandy over loamy in the control section. 
Loup soils are lower on swales on interdunes and are poorly and very poorly drained having a seasonal zone of saturation or aquic conditions beginning at the surface. 
Valentine soils are on higher hummocks and dunes and are excessively drained having no seasonal zone of saturation or aquic conditions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage: moderately well drained
Runoff: negligible
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: very high

USE AND VEGETATION: The major use is livestock grazing. A few areas are cultivated or hayed. Irrigated corn and alfalfa are the major crops. The rangeland native plant community for the sandy lowland ecological site (R065XY029NE) is principally sand bluestem, little bluestem, prairie sandreed, needle and thread, and blue grama.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: In and near the sandhills of Nebraska and South Dakota and mostly in LRR G, MLRA 65. The Nenzel series is of small extent. 
SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Salina, Kansas
SERIES ESTABLISHED: Cherry County, Nebraska, 1995. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 84 centimeters (0 to 33 inches) (A1, A2 and AC horizons) 
Aquic conditions: 84 to 200 centimeters (33 to 79 inches) (Cg1 and Cg2 horizons) 
A calcareous phase is recognized and reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline in the A and AC horizons and slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline in the C horizons. 

5/2007 RRH: A stream terrace phase or new series will need to be established for the Nenzel soils located on non-flooded stream terraces of valleys. 
08/2006 LRM: metric conversion and changed permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity 
5/2007 RRH: Introductory Paragraph: revised landform/landscape; Typical Pedon: changed C1 & C2 horizons to Cg1 & Cg2. Type Location: corrected USGS quad; Competing Series: revised statement. Geographic Setting: revised; Geographically Associated Soils: revised, deleted Valent soils and added Libory soils; Use and Vegetation: revised; Distribution and Extent: revised
The Nenzel series was included with Ipage, Dailey and Dunday series in older surveys. 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Data is available from the National Soil Survey Center, Soil Survey Laboratory for Pedon IDs, 06NE117021 and 06NE005001. Pedon ID 83NE017101 represents the Typical Pedon and is in NASIS.
