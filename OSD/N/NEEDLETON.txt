NEEDLETON SERIES

The Needleton series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in stony and cobbly slope alluvium and colluvium  derived from rhyolite, sandstone, limestone, and shale.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the  Frisco, Helmville, Redondo, Tamarron, Tigeron, and Worock series.  

In addition, the following soils may be competitors when their classification is updated:  Cadotte, Hardzem, Hyattville, Lake Creek, Macfarlane, Tenrag series.

Hardzem and Tamarron:  have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. 

Helmville:  have consistent horizons of calcium carbonate accumulation above depths of 40 inches.  

Hyattville and Lake Creek:  have a lithic contact at less than 40 inches.

Tenrag:  have a lithic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium and colluvium derived from rhyolite, sandstone, limestone, and shale
Landform:  mountain slopes
Slopes:  5 to 90 percent
Elevation: 8,200 to 11,500 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  32 to 38 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  30 to 45 inches.
  Wettest months:  July, August, and September receive slightly more precipitation than other months.
  Driest months:  May and June receive the least precipitation, however the soils are still wet from snowmelt and the soils are usually covered with snow through mid June.
Frost-free period:  40 to 75 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Graysill, Haviland, Scotch, and Snowdon series.

Graysill soils are on mountain slopes, ridges and mesas, are moderately deep and are fine-loamy.
Haviland soils are on mountain slopes and mesas and are fine-loamy.
Scotch soils are on mountain slopes and ridges and are shallow over bedrock.
Snowdon soils are on mountain slopes, structural benches and ridges and are shallow over bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, low to high runoff, moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing, and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is mainly subalpine fir, Engelmann's spruce, Rocky Mountain whortleberry, mountain brome, heartleaf arnica, Richardson's geranium, sedge, smallflowered woodrush, spike trisetum, and snowberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Colorado.  LRR E, MLRA 48A.  This series is of large extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES PROPOSED:  San Juan county, Colorado. Animas-Dolores Soil Survey Area. 1984.  The name is taken from a railroad siding in the area.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon and albic horizon:  The zone from 2 to 16 inches.  (E horizon)
Argillic horizon:  The zone from 16 to 62 inches.  (B/E and Bt horizons)
Particle size control section:  The zone from 16 to 36 inches (B/E and part of the Bt1 horizons)

Keys to Soil Taxonomy:  Classified according to Eighth Edition, 1998

Activity class is presumed from the general trend of other soils in the area. Placement in the Eutric subgroup is based on a limited amount of lab data; pedons that are very strongly acid may have base saturation less than 50 percent in some part, hence in the Typic subgroup. This aspect of the series needs further study.
