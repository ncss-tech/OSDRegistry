NISHNA SERIES

The Nishna series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils formed in alluvium on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 790 millimeters. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, calcareous, mesic Cumulic Vertic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Nishna silty clay, on a slope of less than 1 percent in a cultivated field on a flood plain, at an elevation of about 293 meters above mean sea level. (All colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

 Ap--0 to 18 centimeters; black (10YR 2/1) silty clay, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; friable; very few silt coats of grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; many roots; many pores; neutral; clear smooth boundary.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage--water saturation occurs between 0 to 30 centimeters from March through June in years with normal precipitation (when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30-year mean of annual precipitation) (poorly drained). This saturation is considered apparent. 
Ponding--up to 30 centimeters deep (very poorly drained)
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity--0.01 to 0.10 micrometers per second.
Flooding--occasional or rare for brief periods 

USE AND VEGETATION: Native vegetation includes prairie cordgrass, sedges, river bulrush and other species of the tall grass prairie that are tolerant of wetness. Corn and soybeans are the principal crops when adequate drainage is possible. Some small grain and hay is also grown. See Additional Data section for native vegetative cover in Iowa and Minnesota.
