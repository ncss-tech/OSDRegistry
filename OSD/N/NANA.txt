NANA SERIES

The Nana series consists of very deep, poorly drained alkaline soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on floodplains. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Typic Cryaqualfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Nana loam, in rangeland.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 6 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, gray (10YR 6/1) dry; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 7 inches thick)

    E--6 to 8 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick)

    Btn1--8 to 16 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay loam, gray (10YR 5/1) dry, strong medium columnar structure parting to strong medium angular blocky; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; common grayish brown (10YR 5/2), light gray (10YR 7/2) dry tongues of albic material on upper vertical faces of peds; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.6); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 9 inches thick)

    Btn2--16 to 20 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; strong medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.6); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick)

    2Cn1--20 to 26 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loamy fine sand, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; single grain; loose, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; few medium tubular pores; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.6); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 8 inches thick)

    2Cn2--26 to 60 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly coarse sand, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; 5 percent cobbles, 20 percent gravel; common interstitial pores; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - floodplains.
Elevation - 5,800 to 6,100 feet.
Slope - 0 to 2 percent.
Parent material - alluvium.
Climate - long, cold winters; cool, moist springs; short, summers.
Mean annual precipitation - 15 to 19 inches.
Mean annual air temperature - 34 to 39 degrees.
Frost free season - 30 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Eine, Foolhen, and Zelda soils. Eine soils have a mollic epipedon and are sandy-skeletal. Foolhen soils have a mollic epipedon, are fine-loamy, and are not sodium affected. Zelda soils are fine-loamy. These soils are on similar landform positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; moderate over rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Nana soils are used mainly for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The potential native vegetation is mainly basin wildrye, alkali cordgrass and alkali sacaton, with small amounts of western wheatgrass, inland saltgrass and greasewood.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Nana soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Deerlodge County, Montana, 1999.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1734. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 6 inches (A horizon); an albic horizon from 6 to 8 inches (E horizon); an argillic horizon from 8 to 20 inches (Btn1 and Btn2 horizons); a lithologic discontinuity at 20 inches (2Cn1 horizon); a particle size control section from 8 to 40 inches (Btn1, Btn2, 2Cn1 and 2Cn2 horizons). Nana soils have a cryic temperature regime and an aquic moisture regime.
