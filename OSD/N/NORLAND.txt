NORLAND SERIES

The Norland series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils.  These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary rocks on fan terraces and dissected alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 7 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, calcareous, mesic Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Norland loam - irrigated cropland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Ap--0 to 7 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary.(5 to 7 inches thick).

    C1--25 to 32 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam; brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; carbonates are disseminated; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); clear smooth boundary.(5 to 16 inches thick).

    C2--32 to 47 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam; brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; hard, firm, sticky, plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; carbonates are disseminated; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual smooth boundary.(11 to 24 inches thick).

    C3--47 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam; brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; carbonates are disseminated; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

TYPE LOCATION: Juab County, Utah; Trout Creek Ranch; 1,400 feet east and 1,850 feet south of the northwest corner of section 13, T.13S., R.18W.; 39 degrees and 42 minutes north latitude and 113 degrees and 49 minutes west longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay with individual subhorizons ranging from 18 to 32 percent clay.  Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 25 percent in the particle size control section.  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 53 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 69 to 72 degrees F.  The soil is dry more than 75 percent of the time when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  They are moist in the moisture control section for fewer than 10 days between July and October.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 15 to 40 percent.  It is slightly effervescent or strongly effervescent.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

The A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is loam or gravelly loam.

The Bw horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  Clay content is 18 to 27 percent.  Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 25 percent.  Texture is loam or gravelly loam.

The C horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  Clay content is 8 to 32 percent.  Texture is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam or clay loam.  Coarse fragment content averages 0 to 25 percent, with individual subhorizons ranging as high as 35 percent.

COMPETING SERIES: 
Gotho (UT) soils have hue redder then 7.5YR.

Greybull (WY) soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches and are superactive.

Hostage (UT) soils have secondary carbonates and gypsum in the control section.

Montwell (UT) soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.

Ohtog (UT) soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 50 degrees F., have hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, and 2.5YR, and are superactive.

Teapo (WY) soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.

Turley (NM) soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the control section and have a mean annual soil temperature of 52 to 56 degrees F.

Turzo (UT) soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 51 degrees F., are superactive, and have the precipitation distributed evenly through the year.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Norland soils are on level or nearly level fan terraces and dissected alluvial fans at elevations of 4,300 to 5,800 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium from mixed sedimentary rocks.  The climate is arid.  Average annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 48 to 51 degrees F., and the freeze-free period is 115 to 145 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Nilda(T), Piltdown, Sain(T), Skumpah, and Timpie series.  Nilda soils are poorly and somewhat poorly drained.  Piltdown soils contain less than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Sain and Timpie soils are in the fine-silty particle family.  Skumpah soils have a fine-silty natric horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly as irrigated cropland.  Irrigated crops include alfalfa, small grains and corn.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  West Central Utah, western parts of Juab and Millard Counties.  This series is not extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES PROPOSED:  The Norland series, originally proposed in Tooele Area, Utah, Soil Survey, was not correlated in that survey.  It is being correlated in the West Millard-Juab Soil Survey, Juab County, Utah 1989.   Type location was moved in 1/90.  The name is coined.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 7 inches.

Bw horizon - the zone of structural development with no evidence of either removal of carbonates or clay accumulation from about 7 inches to 25 inches.  (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).

C horizon - the zone from about 25 inches to 60 inches. (C1, C2 and C3 horizons).

Particle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches.

The classification is based on the "Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eighth Edition, 1998".
