NUYOBE SERIES

The Nuyobe series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine sediments from mixed rock sources and volcanic ash.  Nuyobe soils are on alluvial flats, drainageways, lake plains and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Aeric Halaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Nuyobe silty clay loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 8 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 cm thick)

    A2--8 to 15 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; common very fine interstitial pores; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 8 cm thick)

    A3--15 to 18 cm; white (10YR 8/1) very fine sandy loam (volcanic ash), gray (10YR 6/1) moist; moderate fine platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium roots; common very fine interstitial pores; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 40 cm thick)

    Bk1--18 to 56 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silty clay loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; moderate thin platy structure; hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); clear smooth boundary.  (15 to 56 cm thick)

    Bk2--56 to 89 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; common distinct brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist mottles; massive; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 10 percent 1/2 to 3 cm angular carbonate nodules and common medium soft carbonate masses; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.7); gradual smooth boundary.  (25 to 43 cm thick) 

    Bk3--89 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; common distinct brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist mottles; massive; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 20 percent 1 to 5 cm angular carbonate nodules and common medium soft carbonate masses; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.7)

TYPE LOCATION:  Mineral County, Nevada; approximately 15 miles west of Gabbs; about 1,300 feet east and 1,800 feet south of the northwest corner of section 9, T. 12 N., R. 33 E.; USGS Murphys Well, NV 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 55 minutes 24 second N and longitude 118 degrees 16 minutes 23 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.9233333 latitude, -118.2730556 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: These soils are saturated in some horizon between depths of 60 and 90 cm for a brief period in most years.  The capillary fringe moistens the soil to within 15 cm of the surface.
Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 15 degrees C.
Sodicity (SAR): Greater than 13, decreases with depth below 50 cm.
Effervescence: Strongly effervescent through violently effervescent.
Hue:  10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y.
Value:  6 through 8 dry; 4 through 6 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4.  (thin layers of volcanic ash have chroma of 1).

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 18 to 27 percent. When mixed has less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.

A horizons
Reaction:  Strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline.

Bk horizons
Texture: Stratified very fine sandy loam to silty clay loam.
Structure: Platy or massive.
Consistence: Soft or slightly hard dry, slightly sticky or sticky and slightly plastic or plastic.
Reaction:  Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bezo and Yobe series. 

Bezo soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Yobe soils have a water table below 90 cm and have a soil temperature of 8 to 12 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nuyobe soils are on alluvial flats, lake plains and stream terraces. These soils formed in lacustrine sediments from mixed rock sources and volcanic ash. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Elevations are 1,220 to 2,134 meters. The mean annual precipitation is 130 to 200 mm; the mean annual temperature is about 10 to 13 degrees C.; the frost-free season is about 120 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dedmount soils. Dedmount soils are moderately well drained and have a fine textured control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Poorly drained; ponded or slow runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  The water table fluctuates between depths of 60 and about 90 cm in the spring and drops below 150 cm in the fall.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is principally inland saltgrass, alkali sacaton, iodinebush, wiregrass, and black greasewood.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 27, 29.
