NORTEZ SERIES

The Nortez series consists of moderately deep to sandstone, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits derived from sandstone.  Nortez soils are on mesas, ridges, and hills.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Nortez loam on a 6 percent northwest slope in Gambel's oak, sage and grass.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 2 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak thick platy structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; neutral; clear wavy boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick) 

    A2--2 to 6 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; neutral; clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 15 inches thick) 

    BA--6 to 10 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 6 inches thick) 

    Bt1--10 to 13 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; strong fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common faint clay films on the faces of peds; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 20 inches thick) 

    Bt2--13 to 31 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) clay, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; strong medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium angular blocky; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; many distinct clay films on the faces of peds; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 20 inches thick) 

    2R--31 inches; hard Dakota sandstone.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Absarokee, Acree, Brolliar, Delson, Herm, Morapos, Peninsula, Pramiss, Reget, Ricot, Tamaneen, Tomasaki, Tukuhnik, and Work soils.

Absarokee soils have a calcic horizon. 

Acree, Delson, Herm, Morapos, Peninsula, Ricot,  Tamaneen, Tomasaki, Tukuhnik, and Work soils do not have a lithic or paralithic contact with bedrock above a depth of 40 inches. 

Brollier soils are derived from basalt and have basalt rock fragments.

Reget and Pramiss soils have paralithic contacts with shale at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  eolian deposits over hard sandstone
Landform:  mesas, ridges, and hills
Slopes:  0 to 25 percent
Elevation: 7,000 to 9,000 feet
Mean annual temperature:  40 to 47 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation:  15 to 20 inches
Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year with July and August being slightly wetter and June being slightly dryer.
Frost-free period:  70 to 100 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Granath, Pramiss, Ormiston, and Fivepine series.  Granath soils do not have bedrock above 60 inches.  Ormiston soils do not have bedrock above a depth of 40 inches and are skeletal.  Fivepine soils have a lithic contact above a depth of 20 inches. All of these are on similar landforms.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:   well drained, medium to very high runoff, slow permeability

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for grazing, wildlife habitat, and woodland.  Native vegetation at the type location is Gambel's oak, sagebrush, wild crab apple, and western wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwest Colorado.  LRR E, MLRA 48A.  This series is of moderate extent.
