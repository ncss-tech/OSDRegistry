SERIES ESTABLISHED: Orangeburg County, South Carolina; 1985

REMARKS: Noboco soils were previously mapped as the Norfolk series. In 11/2002, the series was reclassified from Typic to Oxyaquic Paleudults and the type location relocated from Orangeburg County, SC to Lee County, SC. In 10/2004, the drainage class was expanded to allow moderately well drained or well drained soils. Although Noboco soils are classified as Paleudults, soils mapped as Noboco commonly have a kandic horizon. Since use and management of the kandic and non-kandic soils is very similar, it is not considered useful to establish a Kandiudult counterpart. The Kandiudult components are to be identified in the NASIS database and correlation and classification documents as taxadjuncts and once sufficient acreage has been reached, a new series may be considered.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 13 inches (A and E horizons).
Argillic horizon--the zone from 13 and 72 inches (Bt horizons).
Aquic conditions--periodic saturation and reduction in a zone from 30 to 40 at some time during the year (endosaturation)

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Laboratory Data: This pedon sampled as S97SC-061-31. Analysis completed by Clemson University.
