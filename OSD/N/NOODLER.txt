NOODLER SERIES 


The Noodler series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in dominantly volcanic alluvium derived from mixed sources. Noodler soils are on fan remnants and fan piedmonts. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

Cleymor soils are moderately acid or slightly acid throughout, have an O horizon and have slickensides. LaPlatta soils have Bk horizons and have an udic moisture regime. Mondey soils have a mollic epipedon less than 50 cm thick and contain secondary carbonates below their argillic horizons. Shar soils are 50 to 100 cm deep to a lithic contact. Streek soils have mollic epipedons 20 to 48 cm thick and have slickensides. Top soils have an O horizon and 15 to 30 percent volcanic glass in their A horizons. Wickiser soils have secondary carbonates at 76 to 112 cm and 5 to 25 percent volcanic glass in their A horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Noddler soils are on fan remnants and fan piedmonts. They occur on footslopes positions. They formed in volcanic alluvium derived from mixed sources. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 1670 to 1980 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 400 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 60 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chrisflat, Needapepper and Slinkard soils.  Chrisflat and Slinkard soils have greater than 35 percent rock fragments and less than 35 percent clay in their particle size control section. Needapepper soils have a 100 to 150 cm thick mollic epipedon and 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle size control section. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained; high or very high surface runoff; slow permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 50 and 76 cm (moderately deep free water occurrence class) between March and July. Cumulative annual duration class is Common. These soils are susceptible to rare flooding for very brief periods between December and September.

USE AND VEGETATION: Noddler soils are used for rangeland, livestock grazing, watershed and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is mainly Nevada bluegrass, Sedge, Meadow barley, Rush and other perennial grasses and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern California, east of the Sierra Nevada Range. These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 26.
