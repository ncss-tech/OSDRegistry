NAVIGON SERIES 

The Navigon series consists of very shallow to shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian sand derived from Navajo sandstone.  Navigon soils are on scree slopes on structural benches.  Slopes range from 30 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, siliceous, mesic Lithic Ustic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Navigon extremely stony fine sand, on an east facing, convex, 36 percent slope at an elevation of 7180 feet. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) When described on 9/17/1998 the soil was dry from 0 to 8 inches. The surface is covered by 35 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, and 20 percent stones, lithology is basalt.

       A--0 to 4 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely stony fine sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; single grained ; loose, loose; nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; 15 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles and 30 percent stones, lithology is basalt; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. 

       C--4 to 8 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very cobbly fine sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; single grained ; loose, loose; nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; 15 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones, lithology is basalt; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary 

       R--8 inches; Navajo Formation sandstone bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION: Garfield County; USGS Escalante quadrangle; lat. 37 degrees 50 minutes 52.40 seconds N. and long. 111 degrees 36 minutes 45.70 seconds W., NAD 83

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture: Ustic aridic moisture regime.

Mean annual soil temperature - 47 to 54 degrees F 

Depth to lithic contact - 4 to 20 inches 

Particle-size control section (weighted average) - 

Clay content: 0 to 8 percent 

Rock fragments: 35 to 70 percent gravel, cobbles, stones, and boulders of basalt 

A horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR 
Value: 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist 
Chroma: 3 or 4 
Rock fragments: Basalt with some sandstone fragments; 35 to 70 percent total rock fragments that consist of gravel, cobbles, stones, and boulders).
Reaction: neutral to slightly alkaline 

C horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR 
Value: 6 to 8 dry, 5 to 7 moist 
Chroma: 3 or 4 
Texture: fine sand or loamy sand

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: eolian sand derived from Navajo sandstone 
Landform: scree slopes on structural benches 
Slopes: 30 to 60 percent 
Elevation: 6,200 to 7,200 feet 
Mean annual air temperature: 45 to 52 degrees F 
Mean annual precipitation: 9 to 12 inches 
Frost-free period: 120 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Nalcase series. Nalcase series has less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained, rapid runoff, very rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for rangeland, recreation and wildlife.  Potential native vegetation is Utah juniper, roundleaf buffaloberry, broom snakeweed, cliffrose, Bigelow sagebrush, two-needle pinyon, Indian ricegrass, and galleta. These soils have been correlated to the Semidesert Shallow Sand (Utah Juniper-Pinyon) 035XY227UT ecological site at the type location in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South central Utah, LRR D, MLRA 35. This series is of small extent.
