NIRA SERIES

The Nira series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loess. These soils are on short, convex to linear side slopes on interfluves on dissected till plains and on risers on loess-covered stream terraces in river valleys. Slope ranges from 2 to 18 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 900 millimeters.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 28 to 51 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 28 centimeters (Ap and A horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 28 to 51 centimeters (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 51 to 102 centimeters (Bg1, Bg2, and BCg horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

Classification change from fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquic Argiudols based on water table data collected from normal annual precipitation.
