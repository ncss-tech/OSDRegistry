NUSMAG SERIES

The Nusmag series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from shale.  Nusmag soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 432 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, frigid Vertic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Nusmag clay loam-Rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.)

     A--0 to 5 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine discontinuous vesicular pores; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 13 cm thick)

     Bw--5 to 46 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine and few very fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual smooth boundary.  (36 to 48 cm thick)

     C--46 to 152 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).

COMPETING SERIES:  
Arosa (NM) - do not have endosaturation

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform - stream terraces
Elevation - 2,500 to 2,440 meters
Slopes - 0 to 3 percent
Parent material - alluvium derived from shale 
Mean annual air temperature - 4.4 to 7.2 degrees C.
Mean annual precipitation - 400 to 460 mm
Frost-free period - 80 to 100 days
A seasonal water table (endosaturation) is usually present during the months of March through June.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; low runoff; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Nusmag soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is western wheatgrass, Kentucky bluegrass and annual forbs.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:   Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, 1989.

REMARKS:  
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - 0 to 46 cm (A and Bw horizons)
Vertic feature is based on estimated linear extensibility 

Nusmag soils have a frigid temperature regime and are in an ustic soil moisture regime with a typic subclass.
