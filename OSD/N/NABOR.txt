NABOR SERIES

The Nabor series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in slope alluvium derived mainly from shale.  Nabor soils are on rolling hills and toeslopes of mountains.  Slopes are 5 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Vertic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Nabor silty clay loam - ponderosa pine woodland, elevation about 2,414 meters. (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     A--0 to 15 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common medium and fine, and few very fine roots; few very fine vesicular pores; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (13 to 41 cm thick)

     Bt1--15 to 43 cm; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silty clay loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; strong fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few medium and common fine roots; few very fine continuous tubular pores; common moderately thick clay films on faces of peds; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  

     Bt2--43 to 66 cm; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silty clay, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few medium and common fine roots; few very fine continuous tubular pores; many moderately thick clay films on faces of peds; neutral; gradual wavy boundary.  

     Bt3--66 to 94 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few medium and common fine roots; few very fine continuous tubular pores; common moderately thick clay films on faces of peds; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (combined thickness of Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 - 55 to 145 cm)

     Bk--94 to 152 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few medium and fine roots; few very fine continuous tubular pores; strongly effervescent; very few fine calcium carbonate accumulations; slightly alkaline.  (0 to 58 cm thick)

COMPETING SERIES:  None listed. However, the Suposo series in a closely related family has smectitic mineralogy and a thinner mollic epipedon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform - alluvium derived mainly from shale on rolling hills and mountain toeslopes  
Elevation - 2,350 to 2,710 meters 
Slopes - 5 to 35 percent
Frost-free period - 70 to 90 days 
Mean annual air temperature - 4.4 to 6.7 degrees C.  
Mean annual precipitation - 630 to 710 mm
Soil moisture - soil is moist in some parts November through April and July through September

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; high runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Nabor soils are used for wood production, livestock grazing, and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is Ponderosa pine, Gambel oak, Rocky Mountain juniper, bluegrass, Arizona fescue, mountain muhly, western wheatgrass, and big sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North central New Mexico, south central Colorado. LRR D, E; MLRA 36, 48A; moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, 1989.

REMARKS:  
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon (pachic) - 0 to 94 cm (A, Bt1, Bt2 and Bt3 horizons)
Argillic horizon - 15 to 94 cm (Bt horizons)
Particle-size control section - 15 to 65 cm (Bt1 and part of Bt2 horizon)

Nabor soils have a frigid temperature regime and are in an ustic soil moisture regime with a typic subclass.
