NEBEL SERIES

The Nebel series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on base slopes of closed depressions in the Central High Tableland (MLRA 72). Mean annual precipitation is 48 centimeters (19 inches), and mean annual temperature is 12 C degrees (54 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ness, Beeler (T), and Ulysses soils. 
Ness soils are poorly drained, do not have accumulations of salt, and are in lower positions. 
Beeler soils are well drained, do not have natric horizons, and are found higher on the landscape. 
Ulysses soils are well drained, do not have argillic horizons or accumulations of salt, and are found on the adjacent tablelands.

Drainage: Moderately well drained 
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: Moderately high or moderately low
Runoff: Low or negligible 
Ponding: rare, brief ponding most common in the months of March, April, and May

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used for grassland. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Kansas. LRR H, MLRA 72 Central High Tableland. The Nebel series is of small extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Finney County, Kansas, 2008 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon: The zone from 0 to 25 centimeters (0 to 10 inches) (Ap horizon)  
Argillic horizon: The zone from 25 to 104 cm (10 to 41 inches) (Bt, Btny1, and Btny2)
Natric horizon: The zone from 51 to 104 centimeters (20 to 41 inches) (Btny1 and Btny2)
In some pedons, visible crystals of gypsum or of more soluble salts may be found within 40 cm of the mineral soil surface.
