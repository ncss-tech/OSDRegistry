NUTIVOLI SERIES
 
The Nutivoli series consists of very deep, excessively drained, and rapidly permeable soils that formed in sandy eolian deposits of Holocene age. These soils are on very gently sloping to moderately steep hills or dunes. Slope ranges from 1 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 483 mm (19 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, thermic Aridic Ustipsamments

TYPICAL PEDON: Nutivoli fine sand, on a west-facing, convex, undulating plain, 2 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of about 1,137 m (3,730 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

   A--0 to 29 cm (0 to 11 in); brown (7.5YR 5/4) fine sand, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium roots; slightly alkaline;noneffervescent; gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 38 cm [4 to 15 in] thick) 

   C1--29 to 120 cm (11 to 47 in); light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) fine sand, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium roots; neutral; noneffervescent; gradual wavy boundary. (Total thickness of C horizons 165 to 193 cm [65 to 76 in] thick) 

   C2--120 to 203 cm (47 to 80 in); light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) fine sand, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; neutral; noneffervescent. 

TYPE LOCATION: Yoakum County, Texas; from the intersection of U.S. 80 and Highway 214 in Plains; 9 miles north on Highway 214; 2 miles east on private ranch road; 1.9 northeast; and 0.7 mile northwest in native range. Latitude: 33 degrees, 20 minutes, 51.53 seconds N; Longitude: 102 degrees, 47 minutes, 3.54 seconds W; Two B Ranch, Texas USGS quad; WGS84. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: An ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic. The soil moisture control section is dry in some or all parts for more than 180 but less than 220 days, cumulative, in normal years. April and October through November are the driest months. These soils are intermittently moist in December through March and May through September. 
Mean annual soil temperature: 15 to 18 degrees C (59 to 64 degrees F). 
Particle-size control section: 2 to 10 percent silicate clay. 

Note: buried A horizons are common. Where present, the A horizons extend to 102 cm (40 in) in some pedons. 

A horizon or Ab horizon (where present): 
Hue: 5YR or 7.5YR 
Value: 5 or 6, 4 or 5 moist 
Chroma: 4 to 8 
Texture: fine sand, loamy fine sand 
Effervescence: none to very slight 
Reaction: neutral or slightly alkaline 

C horizon: 
Hue: 2.5YR to 7.5YR 
Value: 5 or 6, 4 or 5 moist 
Chroma: 4 to 8 
Texture: fine sand, loamy fine sand 
Effervescence: none to very slight 
Reaction: neutral or slightly alkaline 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Likes, Milsand and Mocane series. Similar soils also include Circleback, Plains, Tivoli, and Yoakran series. 
Likes and Milsand series: are calcareous and have secondary carbonates within 102 cm (40 in) of the mineral soil surface. 
Circleback series: have lamellae within 102 cm (40 in) of the mineral soil surface. 
Mocane and Tivoli series: moist in the soil moisture control section for longer periods. 
Plains and Yoakran series: have an argillic horizon. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: sandy eolian deposits of Holocene age. 
Landform: very gently sloping to moderately steep hills or dunes. 
Slopes: 1 to 20 percent. 
Mean annual air temperature: 14 to 17 degrees C (57 to 63 degrees F). 
Mean annual precipitation: 432 to 533 mm (17 to 21 in). 
Frost-free period: 185 to 220 days. 
Elevation: 975 to 1,341 m (3,200 to 4,400 ft). 
Thornthwaite annual P-E Index Values: 25 to 36. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the similar Milsand soils and the Amarillo, Brownfield, Circleback, Gomez, Midessa, Patricia, Plains, and Yoakran soils. 
Milsand soils: on similar landscape positions but have finely disseminated carbonates and are effervescent in all horizons. 
Amarillo, Brownfield, and Patricia soils: are on slightly lower landscape positions and have argillic horizons; in addition these soils have 18 to 35 percent silicate clay in the particle-size control section. 
Circleback soils: are on similar landscape positions but have lamellae within 100 cm (40 in) of the mineral soil surface. 
Gomez and Midessa soils are on lower landscape positions and have calcic horizons. 
Plains and Yoakran soils: are on similar to slightly lower landscape positions and have argillic horizons. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Excessively drained and rapid permeability. Runoff is negligible on slopes less than 5 percent and very low on 5 to 20 percent slopes. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used for livestock grazing. Climax vegetation is tall 
and mid grasses, with sand bluestem, little bluestem, giant sandreed, and 
switchgrass dominating. Sand paspalum, sideoats grama, hairy grama and perennial threeawn are the main mid and short grasses. Sand sagebrush, shinoak, and skunkbush are the main shrubs. This is a fragile site and is subject to severe wind erosion if not protected by cover. This soil has been correlated to the Sand Hills (R077CY034TX) ecological site in MLRA-77C. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern High Plains, Southern Part (MLRA 77C in LRR H) of south-central New Mexico and west Texas. These soils are of moderate extent.
