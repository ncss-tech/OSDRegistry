NEWCASTLE SERIES

The Newcastle series consists of well drained, moderately permeable, moderately deep, loamy soils that formed in residuum from sandstone over sandstone bedrock.  These gently sloping soils are on uplands.  Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, siliceous, superactive, thermic Typic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Newcastle fine sandy loam, very gently sloping--Rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

(6 to 12 inches thick)

    Cd2--34 to 60 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) and yellowish red (5YR 5/6) noncemented sandstone bedrock that slakes in water; about 1 percent by volume distinct discontinuous very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moderately cemented ironstone; fractures are 2 to 5 feet apart horizontally; noncalcareous; moderately alkaline.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Moderate permeability.  Runoff is very low on 1 to 3 percent slopes and is low on 3 to 5 percent slopes. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used as rangeland, however; some areas are cultivated to small grains, cotton and forage sorghums.  The native vegetation is mainly mid and tall grasses with scattering of oaks.  Mesquite, oaks, lotebush, and cactus have invaded most rangeland areas.  Post oak and blackjack oak have formed dense canopies in some of the sandy areas.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Great Plains, North Central Parries; LRR H; MLRA 80B; and possibly Central Rolling Red Parries, MLRA 80A.  The series is of moderate extent.
