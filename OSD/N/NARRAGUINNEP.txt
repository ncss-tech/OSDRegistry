NARRAGUINNEP SERIES

The Narraguinnep series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits derived from shale. These soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, mountain slopes, landslides, drainageways and swales. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 584 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 5.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Pachic Vertic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Narraguinnep silty clay loam, on a southeast facing 20 percent slope in rangeland, at an elevation of 2,480 meters (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A1--0 to 18 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 30 cm thick)

    A2--18 to 46 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (23 to 30 cm thick)

    Bw--46 to 58 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, extremely firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary. (13 to 38 cm thick)

    Bk--58 to 76 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clay, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, extremely firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine threadlike carbonate masses and finely disseminated carbonates; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (13 to 25 cm thick)

    BCk--76 to 150 cm; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) paragravelly silty clay loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; massive; extremely hard, extremely firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine threadlike carbonate masses and finely disseminated carbonates; 25 percent paragravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).
