NODUR SERIES

The Nodur series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from granitic rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash. The Nodur soils are on erosional fan piedmont remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Durinodic Xeric Natrargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Nodur sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is partially covered with 10 percent gravel and 2 percent with cobbles.

(3 to 8 cm thick)

Btn horizons
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR.
Value: 4 through 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma: 3 or 4.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Gardnerville series. Gardnerville soils have mean annual soil temperature of less than 11 degrees C.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nodur soils are on fan piedmont remnants. These soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from granite with a component of loess and volcanic ash. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. Elevations are 1,375 to 1,925 meters. The climate is cool semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 11 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 110 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Shawave and Slipback series. Shawave and Slipback soils have fine-loamy particle-size control sections and lack silica cemented horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium runoff; low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly subspecies of low sagebrush, bluegrass and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 27.
