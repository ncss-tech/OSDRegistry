NOWOY SERIES

The Nowoy series consists of very deep, well drained soils.  that form in mixed alluvium over lacustrine deposits. Noway soils are  on relict alluvial flats. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, carbonatic, thermic Typic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Nowoy gravelly loamy fine sand - rangeland.  About 45 percent of the soil surface is covered with pebbles.  (Color are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly loamy fine sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; 15 percent pebbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (1 to 5 inches thick)

    Bk1--3 to 10 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; 50 percent pebbles; violently effervescent; few very fine lime filaments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 9 inches thick)

    Bk2--10 to 20 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and common fine roots; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; 50 percent pebbles; common fine soft lime masses; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4) abrupt wavy boundary.  (8 to 12 inches thick)

    2Bk3--20 to 36 inches; white (10YR 8/1) clay loam, very pale brown (10YR 8/3) moist; massive; very hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; few very fine interstitial pores; many thin discontinuous weakly lime-cemented plates; violently effervescent, moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual irregular boundary.  (14 to 18 inches thick)

    2Bk4--36 to 51 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay loam; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common fine roots; few very fine interstitial pores; 20 percent lime concretions; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8) clear wavy boundary.  (13 to 17 inches thick)

    2Bk5--51 to 61 inches; white (10YR 8/1) clay loam; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine interstitial pores; common discontinuous weakly lime-cemented masses; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  Nye County, Nevada; approximately 11 miles southwest of the junction of U.S. 95 and State Route 160, about 3,700 feet south and 2,600 feet east of the northwest corner of section 20, T. 17 S., R. 51 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Usually dry.  but moist in some part for short periods during winter and early spring months and for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October due to convection storms.

Soil temperature - 63 to 67 degrees F.

Depth to calcic horizon - 10 to 25 inches.

Calcium carbonate equivalent:  40 to 60 percent.


Control section - Percent clay:  5 to 10 percent in upper part, 27 to 35 percent in the lower part, average 18 to 27 percent.

Rock fragments:  35 to 50 percent in upper part, 0 to 8 percent in the lower part, average 15 to 30 percent.


A horizon - Value:  5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.

Chroma:  2 through 4.


Bk horizon - Value:  5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist.

Chroma:  2 through 4.

Clay content:  5 to 10 percent.

Rock fragments:  35 to 50 percent by average.


2Bk horizon - Hue:  10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y.

Value:  6 through 8 dry, 5 through 8 moist.

Chroma:  1 through 4.

Texture:  Clay loam or silty clay loam.

Clay content:  27 to 35 percent.

Cementation:  Weak lime cementation of peds, plates or masses in some subhorizons.

Other features:  Thin stratification in most profiles.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Jal(NM) and Laveldo(NV) series.  Both these soils lack very gravelly upper profiles with less than 18 percent clay.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nowoy soils are on erosional fan remnants of fan piedmonts and on relict alluvial flats.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium over lacustrine sediments.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 2,000 to 4,000 feet.  The climate is arid with cool winters and  dry summers.  Distribution of precipitation is relatively even with slight peaks in January and August.  The mean annual precipitation is between 3 and 5 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 60 to 65 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 210 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Canutio and Weiser soils.  These soils have a loamy-skeletal control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Very slow or slow runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly shockley goldenhead, shadscale and wolfberry with a few creosotebush, and desertlilly.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 30.
