NEWTONIA SERIES

The Newtonia series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in loess and residuum of the Cherokee Prairies (MLRA 112).  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 99 centimeters (39 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C. (60 degrees F.)

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Paleudolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Newtonia silt loam--rangeland. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A--0 to 28 centimeters (0 to 11 inches); dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) silt loam; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (15 to 36 centimeters (6 to 14 inches) thick)

     BA--28 to 46 centimeters (11 to 18 inches); dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) silt loam; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; few wormcasts; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (10 to 30 centimeters (4 to 12 inches) thick)

     Bt1--46 to 66 centimeters (18 to 26 inches); dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) silty clay loam; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; few wormcasts; nearly continuous clay films on faces of peds; strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (15 to 30 centimeters (6 to 12 inches) thick)

     Bt2--66 to 117 centimeters (26 to 46 inches); dark red (2.5YR 3/6) silty clay loam; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; nearly continuous clay films on faces of peds; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (25 to 51 centimeters (10 to 20 inches) thick)

     Bt3--117 to 157 centimeters (46 to 62 inches); red (2.5YR 4/6) silty clay loam; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; nearly continuous clay films on faces of peds; slightly acid.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loess, loamy and clayey sediments, and residuum

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used for small grains and grain sorghum.  
Small grains are used for pastures.  
The native vegetation is mid and tall grasses.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Lawrence County, Missouri; 1923.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: 46 to 97 centimeters (18 to 38 inches) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Mollic epipedon: The zone from 0 to 46 centimeters (0 to 18 inches) (A and BA horizons)
Agrillic horizon: The zone from 46 to 117 centimeters (18 to 46 inches) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)

Remarks: Newtonia soils were formerly classified in the Reddish Prairie great soil group.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
