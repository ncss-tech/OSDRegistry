NAVINA SERIES

The Navina series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium of Pleistocene age.  These soils are on treads and risers of stream terraces in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A).  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 840 millimeters (33 inches).  Mean annual temperature is 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chickasha, Madge, Milan, Naron, Ravia, Stoneburg, Teller, and Zaneis series.  
Chickasha, Stoneburg, and Zaneis soils: have a solum less than 60 inches thick over sandstone bedrock.  
Madge soils: are dry for longer periods 
Milan and Naron soils: have more than 20 percent sand coarser than fine in the particle size control section.  
Ravia soils: less than 60 inches thick and has more coarse fragments in the lower Bt horizon than the Navina soils.  
Teller soils: have Bt horizons with hue of 5YR or redder

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: loamy alluvium of Pleistocene age
Landform: treads and risers of stream terraces
Slope: 0 to 5 percent, but are dominantly less than 2 percent
Mean Annual Precipitation: 660 to 970 millimeters (26 to 38 inches)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Teller and Vanoss  soils and the associated Dougherty, Konawa, and Pond Creek soils.  
Dougherty and Konawa soils: do not have a mollic epipedon and occur on landscapes that are slightly lower in the landscape than the Navina soils.  
Pond Creek and Vanoss soils: occur on slightly higher landscapes. Pond Creek soils have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick and Vanoss has a fine-silty control section.  
Teller soils: are on similar landscapes and have a redder argillic horizon.

Saturated hydraulic conductivity: moderately high
Runoff: negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes and low on 1 to 5 percent slopes. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly cultivated to small grains, grain sorghum and alfalfa.  Some areas are used for improved pasture or rangeland.  Native vegetation is tall prairie grasses.  The typical ecological site is Loamy Prairie PE 44-64, (R080AY056OK).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Oklahoma; Land Resource Region H; MLRA 80A; moderately extensive.
