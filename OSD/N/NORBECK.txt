NORBECK SERIES

The Norbeck series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum or colluvium derived from granite.  Norbeck soils are on mountains.  Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

Some pedons have a C horizon with properties similar to the BC horizon.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ribhill and Rumplecreek series.  Ribhill soils are moderately deep.  Rumplecreek soils have a frost-free period of less than 90 days and formed in till.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  Residuum or colluvium derived from granite or mixed granite and metamorphic sources such as metaquartzite and siliceous schist.
Landform:  Mountain tops, flanks, and bases
Slopes:  2 to 60 percent
Elevation:  4,600 to 7,200 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  41 to 45 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation:  20 to 26 inches
Precipitation pattern:  In most years, half or more of the annual precipitation occurs as snow and rain from March through July.
Frost-free period:  90 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Buska, Cordeston (micaceous), Pactola and Virkula soils.  Buska soils contain 25 to 40 percent mica (in the 0.02 to 2.0 mm fraction) by weight in the particle size control section and are on similar positions as Norbeck soils.  Cordeston (micaceous) and Virkula soils contain less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section and are below Norbeck soils on the landscape.  Pactola soils formed in residuum or colluvium derived from metamorphic rocks (primarily schist and slate), contain flat rock fragments (channers and flagstones), and typically contain less than 15 percent fine and coarser sand in the fine-earth fraction.  They occur on similar landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, slow to medium runoff, moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Norbeck soils are used for timber production, wildlife habitat, recreation, and livestock grazing.  Native vegetation consists of an overstory of ponderosa pine and aspen; understory species consist of bearberry, common juniper, Oregon grape, bluegrass, Columbia needlegrass, and sedges.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Norbeck soils occur in the Black Hills of South Dakota and Wyoming.  The series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Denver, Colorado

SERIES PROPOSED:  Update Soil Survey of Lawrence County, South Dakota, 2005.  The name is taken from the wildlife preserve in the vicinity of the type location.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 13 to 33 inches.  (Bt/E, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 13 inches.  (Oi,A and E horizon)
Albic horizon:  The zone from 3 to 13 inches.  (E horizon)
Glossic horizon:  The zone from 13 to 19 inches.  (Bt/E horizon)
Argillic horizon:  The zone from 13 to 51 inches.  (Bt/E, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and Bt4 horizons)

Remarks:  The Norbeck series replaces the Mocmont series mapped in the Black Hills parts of Custer and Pennington Counties in South Dakota

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
