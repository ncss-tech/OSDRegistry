NEDSGULCH SERIES

The Nedsgulch series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from schist. The Nedsgulch soils are on side slopes of high hills and mountain. Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 14 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Nedsgulch soils are on backslopes and side slopes of hills. Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from schist. Elevation is 390 to 1175 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 800 to 1225 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 12 to 16 degrees C. The frost free season is 180 to 285 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Arpatutu, Sites, and Wallyhill soils. The Arpatutu soils are on concave hillslopes, are loamy-skeletal and moderately deep to a lithic contact. The Sites soils are on mountains and ridges and are fine, with a percent base saturation of less than 35 percent. The Wallyhill soils are on convex hillslopes and are moderately deep to a paralithic contact.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity in the zone from 0 to 148 cm and moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity in the zone from 148 to 185 cm.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for watershed, wildlife habitat and some home site development. Vegetation includes whiteleaf manzanita, toyon, interior live oak, ponderosa pine, California black oak, Pacific poison oak, California buckthorn, mountain misery, incense cedar, deerbrush, and blue oak.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A.  The series is moderately extensive.
