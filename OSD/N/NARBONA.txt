NARBONA SERIES

The Narbona series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from sandstone on ridges of stable landslides and on backslopes of escarpments. Permeability is rapid in the upper part and moderate below. Slopes are 15 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Arenic Haplustalfs

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competitors.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Narbona soils are on ridges of broad stable landslides and on small landslides of escarpments. These soils formed in colluvium derived from Tertiary sandstone. Slopes are 15 to 70 percent.  Elevations are 7,600 to 9,000 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches with more than 50 percent falling as snow from winter storms; mean annual temperature is 40 to 43 degrees F.; and the average frost-free period is 80 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Deza and Zilditloi soils.  Deza soils are non-skeletal, have an argillic horizon composed of lamellae and occur on adjacent toeslopes and footslopes. Zilditloi soils are non-skeletal and lack argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; rapid permeability in the epipedon and moderate in the subsoil.

USE AND VEGETATION: Narbona soils are used for timber production and limited livestock grazing. Present vegetation is ponderosa pine and Douglas fir with an understory of Gambel oak, nodding bromegrass, earth sedge, silvery lupine, and Oregon-grape.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Narbona soils are of moderate extent on the Defiance Upwarp-Chuska Mountains portion of the Colorado Plateau province in northwest New Mexico and northeast Arizona.  MLRA 35.
