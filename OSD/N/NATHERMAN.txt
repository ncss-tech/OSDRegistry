NATHERMAN SERIES

The NATHERMAN series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or slope alluvium derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rock.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces and eroded fan remnants. These soils are subject to prolonged saturation from flood irrigation. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 1.8 degrees C.

SERIES PROPOSED: Sublette County, Wyoming, 2016. Natherman series is a coined name.  

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon - 0 to 14 cm (Oe, A horizons)
Argillic horizon - 14 to 50 cm (Bt1, Bt2, Btk horizons)
Secondary carbonates - 35 to 200 cm (Btk, BCk1, BCk2 horizons)
Redox concentrations - 10 to 50 cm (A, Bt1, Bt2, Btk horizons) 
Particle-size control section - 14 to 50 cm (Bt1, Bt2, Btk, horizons)

Natherman soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime and an oxyaquic moisture subclass.

Additional Information: Oxyaquic condition is due to prolonged saturation from flood irrigation.
