NADRA SERIES

The Nadra series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess.  Nadra soils are on fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid, shallow Cambidic Haplodurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Nadra loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 5 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate thick platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; few fine vesicular and interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 15 cm)

    A2--5 to 18 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak thin platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many medium and fine roots; common fine and very fine interstitial and tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 15 cm thick)

    Bw--18 to 33 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many medium and fine roots; common fine and very fine interstitial and tubular pores; 15 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (13 to 20 cm thick)

    Bqk--33 to 48 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) gravelly loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; very few fine and very fine roots; very few fine and very fine interstitial and tubular pores; weakly silica and carbonate cemented, 30 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 15 cm thick)

    Bqkm--48 to 84 cm; white (10YR 8/1) strongly cemented duripan with many thin continuous strongly silica cemented laminae; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) moist; massive; very hard, very firm; few fine and very fine roots in cracks; many fine roots matted on upper laminae; few very fine interstitial pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); clear wavy boundary.  (15 to 43 cm thick)

    2Ck--84 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly loamy sand, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; massive; hard, firm, nonsticky and nonplastic, very few very fine roots; many fine and very fine interstitial pores; 70 percent gravel; thick carbonate coatings on gravel; violently effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2)

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nadra soils are on fan piedmonts. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations are 1,830 to 2,135 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 130 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free season is about 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Clowfin and Shipley soils.  Clowfin and Shipley soils lack a duripan.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow or medium runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly shadscale, low rabbitbrush, winterfat, Indian ricegrass, and bud sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.
