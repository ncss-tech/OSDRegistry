NATHAN SERIES

The Nathan series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in thick beds of loamy sediments. Permeability is moderate. These soils are on ridgetops and hillslopes in dissected interfluves of the Cretaceous Western Gulf Coastal Plain. Slopes are commonly from 1 to 8 percent but can range from 1 to 15 percent. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, semiactive, thermic Typic Paleudults 

TYPICAL PEDON: Nathan silt loam, 1 to 8 percent slopes in woodland (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

	A--0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 in); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam; moderate medium granular structure; friable; many fine and medium roots and common coarse roots; very slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.

	E--18 to 36 cm (7 to 14 in); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silt loam; moderate medium granular structure; friable; many fine, medium, and coarse roots; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.

	Bt1--36 to 48 cm (14 to 19 in); brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) silt loam; few medium distinct very pale brown (10YR 7/3) iron depletions and few medium prominent yellowish red (5YR 5/8) iron accumulations; weak and moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine and medium roots and few coarse roots; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.

	Bt2--48 to 66 cm (19 to 26 in); strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) silty clay loam; few medium distinct very pale brown (10YR 7/3) iron depletions; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; firm; medium fine and common coarse roots; many patchy distinct clay films on all faces of peds; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary.

	Bt3--66 to 89 cm (26 to 35 in); yellowish red (5YR 5/8) silty clay loam; few medium distinct dark red(2.5YR 3/6) iron accumulations; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine and medium roots and common coarse; fragments of rounded chert make up 5% by volume; many patchy distinct clay films on all faces of peds; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

	Bt4--89 to 127 cm (35 to 50 in); strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) silt loam; moderate medium few medium prominent red(2.5YR 4/8) iron accumulations, few medium prominent light gray(10YR 7/1) and few coarse and medium distinct yellow (10YR 7/6) iron depletions; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; firm; few medium and very few coarse roots; fragments of shale and soft sandstone make up 10% by volume; few patchy faint clay films on all faces of peds; strongly acid, gradual irregular boundary.

	C--127 to 203 cm (50 to 80 in); yellow (10YR 7/6) silt loam; common coarse prominent light gray(10YR 7/1), common coarse prominent red (2.5YR 4/8), and common coarse prominent yellowish red (5YR 4/6) iron accumulations; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots; few patchy distinct pressure faces on vertical faces of peds; strongly acid.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Pickwick series.
Pickwick soils are on stream terraces and formed form alluvium.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nathan soils are on hillslopes and ridgetops in dissected uplands of the Cretaceous Western Gulf Coastal Plain. The slope range is from 1 to 8 percent. These soils formed in thick beds of loamy marine or fluvial deposits. The climate is warm and humid with mean annual temperature of 60 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation of 47 inches near the type location. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Antoine, Kizzia, Peanutrock, Pikecity, and Tiak soils.
Antoine soils are moderately well drained
Kizzia and Pikecity soils have a fine-loamy control section and Kizzia soils are moderately well drained.
Peanutrock soils have a loamy-skeletal control section.
Pikecity soils are fine-loamy and have a siliceous mineralogy.
Tiak soils have a fine control section and are moderately well drained. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to very rapid runoff; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of the Biggs soils are used for woodland, principally loblolly, longleaf, and shortleaf pines. Cleared areas are used mainly for growing pasture. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Cretaceous Western Gulf Coastal Plain of Arkansas and possibly Oklahoma. The series is of moderate extent.
