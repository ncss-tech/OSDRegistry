NEWHAVEN SERIES

The Newhaven series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy and sandy outwash on low terraces and high flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquic Argiudolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Newhaven loam, in a nearly level area in a cultivated field at an elevation of about 112 meters (368 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

  Ap--0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; moderate fine granular structure; friable; few fine roots; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.

  Bt3-- 76 to 102 cm (30 to 40 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam; moderate coarse prismatic structure; firm; few very fine roots; many faint dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay films on faces of peds; many medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) and common medium faint brown (10YR 5/3) masses of oxidized iron; 4 percent gravel; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary. 

  2Bt4--102 to 119 cm (40 to 47 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few faint dark brown (10YR 3/3) clay films on faces of peds; few medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bt and 2Bt horizons is 30 to 114 cm (15 to 45 inches).]

  2E and Bt-- 119 to 203 cm (47 to 80 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) loamy sand (E) and dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) sandy loam (Bt); weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable (E); moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable (Bt); few distinct dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) clay films on faces of peds and bridging sand grains (Bt); lamella are 1 to 5 cm (1/2 to 2 inches) thick; moderately acid. 

TYPE LOCATION: White County, Illinois; 7 miles south of Carmi; 1,620 feet west and 1,680 feet south of the northeast corner of sec. 20, T. 6 S., R. 10 E.; USGS Emma, Illinois topographic quadrangle; lat. 37 degrees 59 minutes 27 seconds N. and long. 88 degrees 07 minutes 26 seconds W.; UTM Zone 16, 401320 easting and 4205403 northing; NAD 83.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Andres, Aztalan, Darroch, Francesville, Gilboa, Houstenader, La Hogue, Lahoguess, Le Sueur, Marcellon, Odell, and Protivin series. Andres, Aztalan, Gilboa, Houstenader, Le Sueur, Marcellon, Odell, and Protivin soils average more than 15 percent clay in the lower part of the control section. Darroch soils average less than 65 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Francesville soils have a densic contact between 61 and 102 cm (24 and 40 inches). La Hogue and Lahoguess soils do not have lamellae in the lower part of the control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Newhaven soils are on summits of stream terraces and on high flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Newhaven soils formed in loamy and sandy outwash of mixed mineralogy of Wisconsinan Age. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1143 mm (40 to 45 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 12 to 14 degrees C (54 to 57 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Geff, Meadowbank, and Ruark soils. Geff soils are silty in the upper part of the profile, have light colored surface layers, and are on similar positions. Meadowbank soils are better drained and are higher on the landscape. The poorly drained Ruark soils are in lower positions 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part of the profile and high or very high in the lower part. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the profile and rapid in the lower part. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used to grow to corn, soybeans, small grain, and meadow. Native vegetation is prairie grasses. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 114B and 115A in southwestern and southeastern Illinois. The series is of small extent.
