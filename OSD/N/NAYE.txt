NAYE SERIES

The Naye series consists of moderately deep to a petrocalcic, well drained soils that formed in alluvium mainly from limestone and dolomite. Naye soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, thermic Typic Petrocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Naye gravelly fine sandy loam, rangeland and wildlife habitat. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered by approximately 75 percent pebbles. 

	A--0 to 2 inches; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) gravelly fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; strong thick platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and medium and common coarse roots; few vesicular pores; 15 percent pebbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick) 

	Bw--2 to 7 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) gravelly fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and common medium roots; many fine tubular pores; 25 percent pebbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 7 inches thick) 

	Bk1--7 to 18 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very gravelly fine sandy loam, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and common medium roots; few very fine tubular pores; disseminated calcium carbonate throughout; 55 percent pebbles ; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary. 

	Bk2--18 to 25 inches; mottled pink (7.5YR 7/4) and pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) very gravelly fine sandy loam, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; few very fine tubular pores; disseminated calcium carbonate throughout; 40 percent pebbles; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bk horizons is 13 to 30 inches.) 

	Bkm--25 to 40 inches; mottled pink (7.5YR 8/4 and 7/4) stratified gravelly strongly cemented calcium carbonate hardpan with a thin laminar cap; massive; extremely hard, extremely firm, brittle; violently effervescent. 

TYPE LOCATION: Clark County, Nevada; about 15.25 miles southwest of Bunkerville, Nevada: approximately 1440 feet north and 300 feet east of the southwest corner of section 1, T. 16 S., R. 69 E; USGS Whitney Pocket, NV 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; 36 degrees, 34 minutes, 7.5 seconds north latitude, 114 degrees, 14 minutes, 13.7 seconds west longitude; UTM 11, 747237e, 4050588n; NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil moisture - Usually dry, moist in some part during winter and spring and intermittingly moist in the upper part following summer convection storms; typic aridic soil moisture regime. 

Soil temperature - 64 to 71 degrees F. 

Depth to petrocalcic - 20 to 40 inches. 

Other features - Desert pavement covers 60 to 90 percent of soil surface. 

Calcium carbonate equivalent in the fine earth fraction - 40 to 80 percent. 

Control section - Clay content: 5 to 18 percent. 

Rock fragments: 35 to 60 percent mainly gravel. 

A horizon - Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR. 

Value: 4 or 5 moist. 

Chroma: 3 through 6 dry and moist. 

Bw horizon - Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR. 

Value: 4 or 5 moist. 

Chroma: 2 through 6. 

Structure: Fine, medium and coarse subangular blocky structure. 

Consistence: Slightly hard or hard, friable or firm, nonsticky or slightly sticky, nonplastic or slightly plastic. 

Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline. 

Bk horizons - Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR. 

Value: 6 through 8 dry, 4 or 5 moist. 

Chroma: 2 through 6 dry and moist. 

Structure: Weak fine and medium subangular blocky or massive 

Bkm horizon - Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR. 

Value: 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 8 moist. 

Chroma: 0 through 4 dry and moist

Other features: The Bkm horizon ranges from 4 to 24 inches thick. 

Rupture resistance: Strongly cemented to indurated. 

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Naye soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges of 2 to 15 percent. These soils formed in alluvium weathered mainly from limestone and dolomite Elevations are 1,800 to 4,000 feet. The climate is low-latitude desert, with mild winters and very hot summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with a lesser secondary peak in summer, typical of the Mojave Desert. Mean annual precipitation is 4 to 7 inches. Mean annual temperature is 60 to 67 degrees F. Frost-free season is about 220 to 300 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Arizo, Bard, Bitter Spring and Mormon Mesa series. Arizo soils have sandy-skeletal control sections, mixed mineralogy and lack petrocalcic horizons. Bard and Mormon Mesa soils are shallow to the petrocalcic horizon. Bitter Spring soils have an argillic horizon and are very deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; very high runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is principally creosotebush, white bursage, Nevada ephedra, Mohave yucca, joshua-tree and cholla. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southern Nevada; MLRA 30. Naye soils are not extensive.
