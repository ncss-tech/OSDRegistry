NAVILLETON SERIES

The Navilleton series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and the underlying paleosol in clayey residuum. They are on hills and sinkholes underlain with limestone. Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 109 cm (43 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Crider, Hootentown, Peridge, Ryker, Stinesville, and Winnipeg series. All these competing soils are more permeable in the lower part of the series control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Navilleton soils are on summits, shoulders and back slopes of hills and sinkholes underlain with limestone of Mississippian Age. Slopes are 2 to 12 percent. They formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess and the underlying paleosol in clayey residuum. Mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 102 to 117 cm (40 to 46 inches). Frost free days range from 170 to 200; elevation ranges from 152 to 274 meters (500 to 900 feet). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bedford, Crider, Knobcreek, and Haggatt soils. The moderately well drained Bedford soils are on summits. The well drained, more permeable Crider soils are on similar landform positions. The well drained Knobcreek and Haggatt soils are on shoulders and back slopes. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/s) in the upper part of the solum and moderately low or moderately high (0.42 to 1.41 micrometers/s) in the lower part. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and slow in the lower part. The potential for surface water runoff is medium or high. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are typically used to grow crops. Principal crops are corn, soybeans, winter wheat, and grasses and legumes for hay and pasture. A few areas are in forest. Native vegetation is mixed deciduous hardwood forest. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South central Indiana. This series is of small extent in MLRA 122. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Floyd County, Indiana, 2000. 

REMARKS: This soil was included with Crider soils in the 1974 Clark and Floyd Counties, Indiana soil survey, and is identified in the updating of Floyd County. Some data shows the family particle-size class to be contrasting (fine-silty over clayey), but as of 03/2006 this soil is considered dominantly to be in the fine-silty class. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
1) Ochric epipedon: 0 to 20 cm or 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon) 
2) Argillic horizon: 20 to 183 cm or 8 to 72 inches (Bt and 2Bt horizons)
3) Lithic contact: 183 to 203 cm or 72 to 80 inches 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Data for the typical pedon S97IN-043-5 and a similar pedon S97IN-043-2 is available at the NSSL in Lincoln, NE.
