NEZ SERIES

The Nez series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvial deposits derived from igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rock of Pleistocene age.  These soils are mainly on stream terraces on coastal plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 21 degrees C (70 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 1041 mm (41 in).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Colorado County, Texas; 1997.

REMARKS:  These soils were formerly included in the Inez series.  This soil does not have an aquic moisture regime.  These soils were formerly classified as Aquertic Chromic Hapludalfs.  This classification was based on a preliminary analysis of soil moisture data collected on a similar soil.  Further analysis of these data indicate these soils do not have aquic conditions in the upper part in years of normal precipitation.  The gray matrix colors are considered a result of a much wetter climate or abnormally wet years. The vertic feature was dropped from the classification from these soils during 2019 due to lab tests showing low linear extensibility and no visible vertic soil features.  

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 33 cm (0 to 13 in) (A and E horizons)

Argillic horizon: 33 to 203 cm (13 to 80 in) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, and Bt5 horizons).

Additional Comments: The series classification of mixed mineralogy is based on a mineralogy study on similar soils.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Particle-size anlaysis, salinity, and cation exchange capacity tests were performed at the project office on pedon S2019TX2854000.
