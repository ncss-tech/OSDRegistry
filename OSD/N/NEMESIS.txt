NEMESIS SERIES

The Nemesis series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in slide deposits and colluvium derived from mixed metamorphic and sedimentary rock.  These soils occur on avalanche chutes and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 40 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 800 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal over fragmental, mixed, superactive Pachic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Nemesis gravelly loam, in forest on a 65 percent north slope at an elevation of 2317 meters (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

   Oi--0 to 3 cm; slightly decomposed forest litter; clear smooth boundary. (3 to 8 cm thick)

   A--3 to 21 cm; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) gravelly loam, very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 20 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (16 to 25 cm thick)

   Bw--21 to 48 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/2) very gravelly fine sandy loam, very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 40 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary. (24 to 36 cm thick)

   BC--48 to 68 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/2) extremely gravelly fine sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine, and common medium and coarse roots; common fine irregular pores; 75 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (15 to 30 cm thick)

   C--68 to 152 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/3) extremely gravelly loamy sand, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; about half of volume not occupied by rock fragments are voids; few coarse roots; 85 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.2).
