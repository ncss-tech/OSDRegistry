NOBE SERIES

The Nobe series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in clayey alluvium from sedimentary beds.  They are on till plains, alluvial fans, floodplains, stream terraces, and drainageways.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, calcareous, frigid Torrertic Ustorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Nobe silty clay, grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    E--0 to 1 inch; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; vesicular crust in upper part and weak very thin platy structure in lower part; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine and few medium roots; common fine and very fine pores; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt wavy boundary.

    Byz1--9 to 25 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; granular structure (flocculation caused by soluble salts); hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine pores; many threads and masses of gypsum and other soluble salts; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); diffuse smooth boundary. (8 to 20 inches thick)

    Byz2--25 to 66 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) stratified silty clay loam and silty clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine and very fine roots; common very fine pores; common threads and masses of gypsum and other salts; soil is moist in this horizon; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Cascade County, Montana; 50 feet east and 200 feet south of NW corner of sec. 22, T. 22 N., R. 1 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil temperature - 42 to 47 degrees F.

Moisture control section - between 4 to 12 inches; dry in all parts between four-tenths and five-tenths of the cumulative days per year when the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F.

Depth to Byz horizon - 4 to 16 inches.

Depth to saturated zone - 24 to 42 inches for 1 to 4 months in the spring.  The soil is moist below 42 inches when not saturated or frozen.



E horizon - Hue:  10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y

Value:  5, 6, or 7 dry; 3, 4, or 5 moist

Chroma:  2 or 3

Texture:  loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay

Clay content:  20 to 50 percent

EC:  4 to 8 mmhos/cm

SAR:  0 to 13

Calcium carbonate equivalent:  1 to 5 percent

Reaction:  pH 6.6 to 8.4



Bw, Bt horizons - Hue:  10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y

Gypsum:  1 to 6 percent

SAR:  13 to 40 percent

Calcium carbonate equivalent:  1 to 5 percent

Reaction:  pH 7.9 to 10.0



Byz2 horizon - Hue:  10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y

Value:  5, 6, or 7 dry; 4, 5, or 6 moist

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - alluvial fans; stream terraces; floodplains, drainageways.

Elevation - 2,000 to 4,500 feet.

Slope - 0 to 15 percent.

Parent material - clayey alluvium derived locally from sedimentary bedrock and glaciofluvial deposits.

Climate - cool with long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers.

Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 19 inches, more than 70 percent of which falls in spring and early summer.

Mean annual air temperature - 40 to 45 degrees F.

Frost-free period - 100 to 135 days.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; very slow permeability.  Soil is saturated within 60 inches during the spring.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Nobe soils are used mainly for grassland but a few small areas are cultivated along with other soils.  Potential native vegetation is inland saltgrass, alkali grass, western wheatgrass, and greasewood.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Nobe series are of moderate extent and widely distributed throughout Montana and adjacent areas of North Dakota and South Dakota.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Big Horn County (Big Horn Area), Montana; 1970.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT0014, MT0472.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
a.vesicular surface crust of 1/2-inch thick (E horizon); an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches (mixed)(E, Bw, By horizons); a horizon of gypsum accumulation from 4 to 9 inches (By horizon); accumulation of gypsum and other salts from 9 to 60 inches (Byz1, Byz2 horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Byz1, Byz2 horizons).  Nobe soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.

Series will be reclassified to the proposed Torrertic subgroup when it is approved.
