NEVADANILE SERIES

The Nevadanile series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Nevadanile soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Oxyaquic Torrifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Nevadanile loam--cropland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    C1--46 to 81 cm; light gray (5Y 7/2) silt loam, olive gray (5Y 4/2) moist; few fine and medium prominent brown (7.5YR 4/4) masses of iron accumulation; massive; very hard, weakly brittle, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; few thin very dark gray (5Y 3/1), black (5Y 2.5/1) moist, horizontal and vertical bands of soil material; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (12 to 46 cm thick)

    2C2--81 to 152 cm; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) stratified sand and coarse sand, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family..

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nevadanile soils are on filled in stream and river channels on flood plains.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent and are dominantly less than 0.5 percent.  Elevations are 1,190 to 1,250 meters.  The climate is cool, arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm; mean annual air temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C.; and the frost-free season is 120 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Humboldt, Placeritos, Sondoa, Sonoma, and Toy series.  All these soils lack sandy textures above 100 cm.  Humboldt soils have dark-colored surface horizons and averages 35 to 45 percent clay in the textural-control section.  Placeritos, Sondoa and Sonoma soils have less than 15 percent sand that is fine sand or coarser.  Toy soils have dark-colored surface horizons and 60 to 80 percent clay in the natric horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; very slow runoff; permeability moderately slow; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity in the upper part and rapid permeability; high saturated hydraulic conductivity in the lower part.  Saturated within 100 cm for one month or more during February through August unless drained, The water table is at 90 to 150 cm from February through August.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for rangeland, wildlife and cropland.  Areas that are nonsaline are cropped for alfalfa hay and small grain.  The present vegetation on strongly saline areas is inland saltgrass and black greasewood vegetation.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North central Nevada. MLRA 27  These soils are not extensive with about 1325 acres mapped.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Pershing County, (Lovelock Area), Nevada, 1985.

REMARKS:  Name is coined.  This soil was formerly mapped as Placeritos series, over sand in the Lovelock Soil Survey Area.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the surface to about 18 cm (Ap and part of Bk1 horizons).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (C horizon and parts of the Bk2 and 2C horizons).
