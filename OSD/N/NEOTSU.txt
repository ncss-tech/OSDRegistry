NEOTSU SERIES

The Neotsu series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or residuum derived from igneous rock and in some areas basaltic sandstone. Neotsu soils are on summits, benches, shoulder slopes, and backslopes of coastal hills and mountains. Slopes are 0 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 85 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is usually moist but is dry less than 45 consecutive days between the depths of 4 and 12 inches following the summer solstice. The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F. The difference between the mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F under canopy cover. The umbric epipedon is 12 to 20 inches thick. Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches. The solum is weakly to moderately smeary.  It has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.70 to 0.90 g/cubic centimeter, phosphate retention of 95 to 100 percent, Alox +  Feox of 2 to 4 percent, and 15-bar moisture (dried) of 20 to 35 percent. The texture control section averages less than 35 percent rock fragments.  Reaction is extremely acid or very strongly acid.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Neotsu soils formed in colluvium and residuum from basic igneous rock and in some areas basaltic sandstone. They are on summits, benches, and side slopes of coastal hills and mountains at elevations of 50 to 1,800 feet. Slopes are 0 to 90 percent. The soils The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and cool moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 70 to 130 inches. The mean annual temperature is 44 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free period is 100 to 260 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Necanicum and the competing Klootchie, Knappton, Neskowin, and Salander soils. Necanicum soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock.  All of these soils are on summits, shoulders and side slopes of coastal hills and mountains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation includes western hemlock, Douglas fir, Sitka spruce, western redcedar, red alder, cascara, vine maple, salal, evergreen huckleberry, red huckleberry, red elderberry, deer fern, false azalea, western swordfern, and cascade Oregongrape.
