NAMBE SERIES

The Nambre series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material derived from granite, gneiss and schist.  Nambre soils are on mountain sideslopes and have slopes of 20 to 100 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 112 cm and the mean annual air temperature is about 0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, isotic Entic Haplocryods

TYPICAL PEDON:  Nambe loam, spruce forest.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 3 cm; slightly decomposed organic matter consisting principally of needles, twigs and bark.

    Oe--3 to 6 cm; partially decomposed organic matter.

    A--6 to 14 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine crumb structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and medium roots; many very fine to medium pores; approximately 10 percent stones; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 10 cm thick)

    E--14 to 26 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common medium and fine roots; many fine to medium pores; approximately 15 percent stones; very strongly acid (pH 4.5); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 15 cm thick)

    Bs1--26 to 52 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; common fine pores; approximately 30 percent stones; undersides of the stones have dark coatings presumed to be humus and iron oxides; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (20 to 36 cm thick)

    Bs2--52 to 67 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; approximately 60 percent stones; the stones have reddish brown coatings presumed to be humus and iron oxides; cementation in places; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (13 to 30 cm thick)

    C--67 to 158 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; approximately 60 percent stones; very strongly acid (pH 5.0).
