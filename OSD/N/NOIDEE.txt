NOIDEE SERIES

The Noidee series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in loess derived from mixed rocks over residuum derived from basalt. Noidee soils are on plateaus and hills. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, smectitic, frigid Lithic Xeric Natrargids 

TYPICAL PEDON: Noidee extremely stony fine sandy loam--on a southwest facing slope of 4 percent at an elevation of about 1,770 meters--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     Btn2--13 to 23 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; common faint and few distinct clay films on faces of peds; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); gradual smooth boundary. (10 to 20 cm thick) 

     Btnk--23 to 41 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; secondary carbonates segregated as common fine masses in the matrix; strongly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (5 to 18 cm thick) 

     2R--41 cm; hard fractured basalt.

COMPETING SERIES: There are currently no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Noidee soils are on plateaus and hills. They typically occur on summit and shoulder positions. These soils formed in loess derived from mixed sources over residuum derived from basalt. These soils occur downwind of a salty playa (Summer Lake) and frequently receive new deposits of loess high in sodium salts. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,335 to 1,830 meters. The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 330 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Diablopeak, Lonegrave, and Yankeewell soils. Diablopeak soils are clayey, shallow to lithic contacts, and have a typic aridic moisture regime. Lonegrave soils are loamy-skeletal, moderately deep to lithic contacts, have cambic horizons, and a mesic temperature regime. Yankeewell soils are loamy and shallow to duripans. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very high surface runoff; slow permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Noidee soils are used for livestock grazing. The present vegetation is black sagebrush, shadscale, Wyoming big sagebrush, bud sagebrush, Sandberg's bluegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Oregon. These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 23.
