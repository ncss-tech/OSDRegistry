NEWETT SERIES

The Newett series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from limestone and sandstone.  Newett soils are on hills.  Slopes range from 1 to 10 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 305 mm (12 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 3.9 degrees C (39 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy, mixed, superactive, shallow Ustic Calcicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Newett loam, on a south facing, 2 percent slope in grassland at an elevation of 2,761 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

       A1--0 to 8 cm (0 to 3 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, and slightly plastic; 10 percent parachanners; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary.

       A2--8 to 18 cm (3 to 7 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) very parachannery loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, and slightly plastic; 45 percent parachanners; 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the A horizons is 18 to 25 cm)

       Bk1--18 to 30 cm (7 to 12 inches); light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) very parachannery loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky, and slightly plastic; 50 percent parachanners; strongly effervescent; common fine carbonate masses in the matrix; 23 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.

       Bk2--30 to 48 cm (12 to 19 inches); light gray (2.5Y 7/2) extremely parachannery loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; massive; hard, very friable, slightly sticky, and slightly plastic; 70 percent parachanners; strongly effervescent; common fine carbonate masses in the matrix; 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (combined thickness of the Bk horizons is 15 to 30 cm)

       Cr--48 to 74 cm (19 to 29 inches); moderately cemented limestone

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series. A similar soil in a closely related family is the Kenosha series. Kenosha soils are deeper than 50 cm to a paralithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium derived from Pennsylvanian age limestone and sandstone, commonly associated with the Minturn and Belden Formations
Landform:  hills
Slopes:  1 to 10 percent
Elevation:  2,713 to 2,774 meters (8,900 to 9,100 feet)
Mean annual temperature:  1.7 to 3.9 degrees C (35 to 39 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation:  254 to 356 mm (10 to 14 inches)
Precipitation pattern:  Monthly precipitation is lowest in winter and greatest in July and August.
Frost-free period:  50 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Kenosha series.  The Kenosha soils are moderately deep and are on hills.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, moderate permeability

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation consists of Arizona fescue, Indian ricegrass, blue grama, mountain muhly, needleandthread, and western wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Colorado; LRR E, MLRA 48B; small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Park County, Colorado, Teller-Park soil survey area, Colorado, 2010.  The name is from an old townsite in nearby Chaffee County.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 74 cm.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 25 to 48 cm.  (Bk1, Bk2 horizons)
Mollic epipedon:  from 0 to 18 cm.  (A1, A2 horizons)
Calcic horizon:  from 18 to 48 cm.  (Bk1, Bk2 horizons)
Paralithic contact:  The contact with limestone at 48 cm.  (Cr layer)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
