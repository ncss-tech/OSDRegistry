NOSRAC SERIES

The Nosrac series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from andesite and schist.  Nosrac soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ashue, Badena, Badenaugh, Eaglerock, Gitabyte, Grinrod, Ister, Lemm, Leviathan, Oest, Searles, Searvar, Shawmount, Shree, Shroe, Tollgate, Trid, and Tristan series.

Ashue soils have a combined thickness of the A and Bt horizons that is less than 84 cm with mollic epipedons 18 to 30 cm thick, and contrasting very gravelly sand below 76 cm.  Badena soils have 60 to 85 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and September due to convection storms.  Badenaugh soils have A and Bt horizons 69 to 109 cm thick, mollic epipedons less than 36 cm thick, are neutral or slightly acid in the upper part decreasing to slightly acid or moderately acid in the lower part.  Eaglerock, Trid, and Searvar soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Gitabyte, Grinrod, Ister, and Searles soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Lemm soils have A and Bt horizons 76 to 122 cm thick and sandy loam argillic horizons with less than 18 clay.  Leviathan soils have mollic epipedons 23 to 36 cm thick and subhorizons of sandy clay loam or sandy clay in the argillic horizon.  Oest soils have A and Bt horizons 76 to 127 cm thick, sandy loam or sandy clay loam argillic horizons with 18 to 27 percent clay, and very gravelly loamy sand or very gravelly sand below 100 cm.  Shawmount soils have argillic horizons with more than 45 percent sand, depth to base of the argillic horizon of 50 to 100 cm, and have a horizon with lamellae below the argillic horizon.  Shree soils have depth to base of the argillic horizon of 60 to 90 cm.  Shroe soils have depth to base of the argillic horizon of 50 to 100 cm, mollic epipedons 18 to 30 cm thick, and subhorizons of the argillic horizon with 35 to 45 percent clay.  Tollgate soils have a mollic epipedon 20 to 36 cm thick. Tristan soils are 100 to 150 cm deep to bedrock, have strong grade of structure and unweathered stones and cobbles.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nosrac soils are on hills and mountains.  They typically occur on north-facing backslope positions.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from andesite and schist.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,525 to 2,320 meters.  The climate is semiarid.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cagle soils.  Cagle soils are fine textured and moderately deep to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Nosrac soils are used for forest land, livestock grazing, and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is mainly singleleaf pinyon and Utah juniper, Wyoming big sagebrush, prickly currant, Sandberg's bluegrass, cheatgrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail. This pedon is correlated to ecological site R026XY005NV, Loamy 12-14"PZ.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada and eastern California.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 26.
