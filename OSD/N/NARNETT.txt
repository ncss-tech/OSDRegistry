NARNETT SERIES

The Narnett series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources, dominated by loess, with a thin mantle of volcanic ash.  The Narnett soils are on stream terraces and mountain footslopes.  Slopes are 5 to 30 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The mean annual precipitation is about 47 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Meadowport series. Meadowport soils do not have a 3C horizon and have Btb horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Narnett soils are on old stream terraces and mountain footslopes.  These soils formed in alluvium from mixed sources, dominated by loess, with a thin mantle of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 5 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 3,200 to 4,400 feet.  The climate is cool and moist.  The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches; mean annual temperature is 38 to 41 degrees F.; and the frost-free season is 30 to 100 days (9 in 10 years to 1 in 10 years, respectively).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Mushel and Dullaxe soils.  These soils are frigid and on mountain slopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing, homesites, recreation, and wildlife habitat.  Potential natural vegetation is subalpine fir, douglas fir, grand fir, western white pine, western larch, and lodgepole pine, with an understory of wild ginger, greencup beadlily, beargrass, bunchberry dogwood, myrtle pachystima, goldthread, violet, common princes pine, longtube twinflower, starry false-Solomons-seal, western rattlesnake plantain, American trailplant, shinyleaf spirea, labrador tea, and huckleberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Idaho.  This soil is not extensive.
