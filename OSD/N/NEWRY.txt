NEWRY SERIES

The Newry series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in 35 to 60 centimeters of silty or loamy sediments and the underlying calcareous, loamy glacial till. These soils are on linear and slightly convex slopes on ground moraines. Slope ranges from 1 to 4 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 30 to 80 centimeters (Bt1, 2Bt2, and 2Bt3 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (Ap, BE, Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3, 2Bt4, 2BC, and 2C horizons). 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 20 centimeters (Ap horizon);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 30 to 102 centimeters (Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3, and 2Bt4 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
