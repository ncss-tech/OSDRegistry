NORMANIA SERIES

The Normania series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loamy calcareous till.  These soils are on slightly concave to slightly convex slopes on upper parts of drainageways and swales on ground moraines and till plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 610 to 930 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lyon County, Minnesota, 1976.

REMARKS:  
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 cm;
Series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 cm.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 43 centimeters (Ap, A and AB horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from 43 to 66 centimeters (Bw horizon);
calcic horizon--the zone from 66 to 127 centimeters (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons);
udic moisture regime;
aquic subgroup--iron depletions in calcic horizon (Bk)

Drainage and saturation was revised to align with historical series concept following an analysis of Taxonomic Unit Description pedons throughout MLRA 103.
