NEWFLAT SERIES

Soils of the Newflat series are very deep and somewhat poorly drained with very slow permeability.  They formed in clayey fluvial sediments on Coastal Plain river terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches and mean annual temperature is about 59 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, subactive, thermic Aeric Endoaquults

TYPICAL PEDON:  Newflat silt loam - on a 1 percent slope in woodland.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

A--0 to 2 inches; very dark gray (1OYR 3/1) silt loam; moderate fine granular structure; very friable; many fine and common medium roots; extremely acid; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 4 inches thick)

(0 to 4 inches thick)

Bt--5 to 10 inches; light yellowish brown (1OYR 6/4) clay loam; few fine distinct light gray (1OYR 7/1) iron depletions and many coarse faint brownish yellow (1OYR 6/6) masses of iron accumulation; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few fine roots; few distinct clay films on faces of peds; extremely acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 6 inches thick)

Btg2--20 to 35 inches; gray (1OYR 6/1) clay loam; common medium distinct yellowish brown (1OYR 5/6) and strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine and medium angular blocky; firm, very sticky, very plastic; few fine roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; extremely acid; gradual smooth boundary.

Btg3--35 to 75 inches; light gray (1OYR 6/1) silty clay; common medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm, very plastic; thin patchy clay films on faces of peds; extremely acid.  (Combined thickness of the Btg horizon is 55 to more than 90 inches thick)

TYPE LOCATION:  Prince George County, Virginia; approximately 550 yards southwest of intersection of VA-10 and VA-616, 25 yards south of VA-616.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness ranges from 60 to 90 inches or more.  The soil is extremely acid through strongly acid unless limed.  Quartz gravel make up 0 to 2 percent of the solum.  The particle-size control section has more than 30 percent silt.  Aluminum saturation on the exchange complex is commonly greater than 50 percent and ranges from 10 to 20 meq/100 grams of soil.  Fine flakes of mica range from few to common in some pedons.

The A horizon has hue of 1OYR or 2.5Y or it is neutral, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 0 through 2. Horizons with value of 3 are 6 inches or less thick.  The A horizon is very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.

The Ap horizon has hue of 1OYR or 2.5Y or it is neutral, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 0 through 2. Horizons with value of 3 are 6 inches or less thick.  The Ap horizon is very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.

The E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 4.  The E horizon is very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.

The BE horizon, where present, has hue of 1OYR through 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.  In some pedons, it is mottled with gray.  It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.

The Bt horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 through 6. It has common to many high and low chroma redox features.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.

The Btg horizon has hue of 1OYR through 5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 0 through 2.  It has common to many high chroma redox features.  The Btg horizon is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.

The BC horizon where present, has hue of 10YR through 5Y or it is neutral, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 0 through 2.  It is loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or clay.

The C horizon has hue of 1OYR through 5Y or it is neutral, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 0 through 2.  It ranges from fine sandy loam through clay.

COMPETING SERIES:  (This section not checked this date; particle-size and activity class changes) Wahee is the only known series in this family. Wahee soils have slow permeability and COLE of .09 or less throughout the argillic horizon.  Similar soils in related families include Dunbar, Lenoir, and Smithboro.  Dunbar and Smithboro soils have kaolinitic mineralogy.  Lenoir soils have less than 10 percent weatherable minerals in the sand and silt fraction of the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Newflat soils are on nearly level areas of Coastal Plain stream terraces.  The soils formed in clayey fluvial sediments of low energy deposition.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 49 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 64 degrees F near the type location.  Elevation at the type location is about 60 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Augusta, Chickahominy, Peawick, Tetotum, and Wickham soils.  Augusta soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section.  Chickahominy soils are poorly drained and are on slightly lower landscape positions.  Peawick, Tetotum, and Wickham soils are better drained and are on higher landscape positions.  In addition, Tetotum and Wickham soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; slow runoff; very slow permeability.  A water table is at a depth of 6 to 18 inches below the surface from November to April.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Newflat soils are mostly in woodland. Dominant tree species include white oak, southern red oak, water oak, sweetgum, and loblolly pine.  Farmed areas are used for corn, soybeans, or hay and pasture.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Coastal Plain in Virginia and possibly North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama.  The series is of moderate extent.

ESTABLISHED SERIES:  Prince George County, Virginia, 1980.

REMARKS:  Newflat soils have previously been included with Wahee and Lenoir soils.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 5 inches (A and E)

2.  Argillic horizon - the zone between 5 and 75 inches (Bt, Btg1, Btg2, and Btg3)

3.  Clayey - more than 35 percent clay in the partical-size control section.

4.  Base saturation - Is less than 35 percent at 55 inches.

5.  Aeric - 4 chroma dominant below the E horizon (2 chroma or less is present)

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Particle-size, chemical, and engineering data from VPI & SU is available for the typical pedon (79VA-149-50). Additional chemical data is available for 1 pedon from James City County, Virginia.
