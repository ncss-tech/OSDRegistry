NOCA SERIES

The Noca series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and reworked glacial drift on debris aprons, valley walls, and Pleistocene moraines.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent on debris aprons and Pleistocene moraines, and 25 to 65 percent on valley walls.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1,800 millimeters.  The mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, amorphic over isotic Spodic Vitricryands

TYPICAL PEDON:  Noca gravelly ashy sandy loam, on a valley wall landform with a NW facing slope of 60 percent at 1670 meters elevation under coniferous forest vegetation.  When described on September 18, 2007 the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Doubtful (T), Line, and Spickard (T) series.  Doubtful soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 50 to 100 cm and lack an albic horizon.  Line soils have 2C horizons in the lower part of the particle-size control section that are sand or coarse sand in the fine earth fraction.  Spickard soils lack an albic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Noca soils are on debris aprons, valley walls, and Pleistocene moraines at elevations of 1060 to 1930 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in mixed volcanic ash and reworked glacial drift.  The climate consists of cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1,800 to 3,300 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 2 to 6 degrees C. Frost free season is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chilliwack (T) and competing Spickard (T) soils.  All of these soils are found on the same landforms and under very similar conditions.  Chilliwack soils are Spodosols. Spickard soils lack albic horizons. Noca is a common transition soil between Chilliwack and Spickard, where time has been insufficient to form a well-developed Spodosol.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for watershed, recreation, woodland, and wildlife habitat.  Potential natural vegetation consists of Pacific silver fir, subalpine fir, mountain hemlock and potentially minor amounts of Douglas-fir at lower elevations, with an understory of prince's pine, pachistima, queen's cup bead lily, western rattlesnake plantain, dwarf bramble, and black huckleberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western slopes of the North Cascade Mountains, Washington.  MLRA 3.  Series is of moderate extent.
