SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Middlesex County, Virginia, 1982.

REMARKS: 1.  In the past Nevarc soils have been included with higher units of taxonomic classification. 2. Nevarc soils have also been part of the Craven soils concept in the past.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 14 inches (A and E horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 14 to 42 inches (Bt horizons)
Aquic conditions--the soil has redox depletions and concentrations within the upper 24 inches of the argillic horizon, with periodic saturation and reduction at some time during the year
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches
