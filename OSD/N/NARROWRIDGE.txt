NARROWRIDGE SERIES

The Narrowridge series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium and mass movement deposits derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rocks.  These soils are on hillslopes, mountain slopes, eroded fan remnants and landslides.  Slopes are 4 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 450 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 1.2 degrees C.
