NARLON SERIES

The Narlon series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in old eolian deposits over clayey marine deposits. Narlon soils are on marine terraces and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 415 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 14 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, semiactive, isomesic Typic Albaquults
