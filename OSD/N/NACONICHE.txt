NACONICHE SERIES

The Naconiche series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, nearly level soils on flood plains.  These soils formed in stratfied sandy and loamy alluvial sediments.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, siliceous, thermic Cumulic Humaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Naconiche mucky sandy loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes in a forested flood plain.
          (colors are for moist soil conditions)

   A1--0 to 12 inches; very dark gray (7.5YR 3/0) mucky sandy loam; many medium white (10YR 8/2) spots of sand; massive; many fine, medium and coarse roots; about 20 percent decomposing leaves, roots, and twigs; extremely acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (6 to 16 inches thick)

   A2--12 to 19 inches; black (7.5YR 2/0) mucky fine sandy loam; massive; few fine and medium roots; about 10 percent decomposing leaves, roots, and twigs; extremely acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick)

   A3--19 to 29 inches; very dark gray (7.5YR 3/0)  sand; single grained; common fine and medium roots; extremely acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (6 to 16 inches thick)

   A4--29 to 32 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) sand; single grained; common white (10YR 8/2) spots of loamy fine sand; few fine and medium roots; extremely acid; abrupt smooth boundary.(0 to 8 inches thick)

   A5--32 to 36 inches; black (10YR 2/1) loamy sand; massive; few white (10YR 8/2) spots of sand; few fine and medium roots; extremely acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick)

   Cg--36 to 40 inches; light gray (10YR 7/1) sand; single grained; few fine and medium roots; few medium rounded masses of iron-manganese; very strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick)

   Ab1--40 to 45 inches; black (10YR 2/1) sand; single grained; few fine and medium roots; few medium rounded masses of iron-manganese; extremely acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick)

   Ab2--45 to 52 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) mucky fine sandy loam; massive; few streaks and spots of dark brown (10YR 4/3) and black (10YR 2/1); few fine and medium roots; extremely acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick)

   C'g--52 to 57 inches; light gray (10YR 7/1) sand; single grained; few fine and medium roots; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 20 inches thick)

   A'b--57 to 67 inches; black (N 2/0), very dark gray (10YR 3/1), and white (10YR 8/2) loamy fine sand; massive; few fine and medium roots; extremely acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 12 inches thick)

   C''g--67 to 73 inches; white (10YR 8/2) fine sand; single grained; few fine and medium roots; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary.(0 to 10 inches thick)

   A''b--73 to 80 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2)  fine sand; single grained; few fine and medium roots; very strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Rusk County, Texas; From the intersection of U.S.  Highway 259 and U.S. Highway 84 in Mt. Enterprise, 5.0 miles south on U.S. Highway 259, 1.5 miles east on Old Prospect Road to Morrow Creek, 400 feet south in wooded flood plain.  (Latitude: 31 degrees, 50 minutes, 46 seconds north; Longitude: 94 degrees, 39 minutes, 5 seconds west)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Stratified sandy and loamy sediments are more than 80 inches thick. Organic matter content ranges from 2 to 15 percent in the upper 16 inches and averages more than 1 percent throughout the upper 20 inches.  Iron manganese concretions and masses range from none to few.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid throughout.

The A horizon including buried A horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of N to 3.  Texture is sand, loamy sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand, mucky loamy sand, mucky sandy loam, and mucky fine sandy loam.  Streaks and spots of black, white, gray, or brown range from none to common.

The Cg horizons have hue of 10YR, value 6 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redox concentrations in shades of brown and yellow range from none to common.  Texture is sand or fine sand.
COMPETING SERIES:  The Pickney series is the only competing series in this family.  Series in similar families include Englehard, Elkins, Melhomes, and Osier.  The Pickney series does not have buried A horizons and formed in marine sediments.  Englehard soils have coarse-silty control sections.  Elkins soils have fine-silty control sections.  Melhomes soils have sandy textures throughout and have a regular decrease in organic matter with depth.  Osier soils have an argillic horizon below a depth of 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Naconiche soils are on nearly level flood plains with poorly defined stream channels and in depressional areas.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in stratified  sandy and loamy alluvial sediments.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 65 to 67 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 50 inches.  Elevation ranges from 420 to 450 feet above sea level.  Growing season ranges from 235 to 250 days. The Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 66 to 74.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Tonkawa, Betis, Kawah, Darco, Tenaha and Iulus soils.  The Tonkawa, Betis, Darco, and Tenaha soils are on higher upland positions.  These soils are well drained or excessively drained.  Kawah soils are in depressional upland positions.  They do not have buried A horizons and their water table is typically below a depth of 18 inches. Iuka soils are on adjacent flood plains and they have coarse-loamy control sections and are moderately well drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Naconiche soils are very poorly drained.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  Runoff is negligible.  The water table is at or within 12 inches of the surface for 12 months in most years.  These soils are frequently flooded or they pond water for long or very long durations.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are forested.  However they are used mainly for wildlife habitat.  Forest vegetation includes sweetbay, black gum, red maple, red bay, water oak, willow oak and scattered lobolly pine.  The understory is mainly water tolerant shrubs and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: East Texas and possibly Southwest Louisiana.  The series is of moderate extent.
