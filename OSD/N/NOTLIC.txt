NOTLIC SERIES

The Notlic series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks.  Notlic soils are on alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 5 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Ustic Torriorthents
  
TYPICAL PEDON:  Notlic very cobbly loam, on a south facing, linear to concave, 9 percent slope in Utah juniper and pinyon pine at an elevation of 5,740 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    The surface is covered by 20 percent gravel and channers, 10 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones.

    A--0 to 4 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) very cobbly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak thin platy structure parting to weak fine and very fine subangular blocky; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine, few medium roots; many very fine, few fine and medium tubular pores; 20 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, 10 percent channers, 5 percent stones; very slightly effervescent; calcium carbonate is disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 5 inches thick)

    C1--4 to 13 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely gravelly fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine, few medium roots; many very fine, common fine, few medium tubular and interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, 10 percent channers, 5 percent stones; slightly effervescent; calcium carbonate is disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary.

    C2--13 to 29 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) extremely gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, few fine roots; many very fine, common fine, few medium tubular and interstitial pores; 30 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, 10 percent channers, 15 percent stones; slightly effervescent; calcium carbonate is disseminated; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual wavy boundary.

    C3--29 to 48 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, few fine roots; many very fine, few fine and medium tubular and interstitial pores; 45 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, 10 percent channers; slightly effervescent; calcium carbonate is disseminated; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual wavy boundary.

    C4--48 to 60 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely cobbly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine, few fine tubular pores; 35 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, 10 percent channers, 10 percent stones; slightly effervescent; calcium carbonate is disseminated; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  Uintah County, Utah; along Jones Hole Creek about 1 miles north of the confluence with Ely Creek; located about 700 feet south and 1,500 feet west of the northeast corner of sec. 12, T.3 S., R.25 E., SLBM; Jones Hole, Utah-Colo. USGS quad; lat. 40 degrees 34 minutes 41 seconds N. and long. 109 degrees 3 minutes 12 seconds W., NAD 27

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture regime:  Aridic bording ustic.  The moisture control section is affected by precipitation that falls evenly through the year with a slight increase in late summer and fall.
Mean annual soil temperature:  47 to 51 degrees F.
Surface rock fragments:  30 to 50 percent predominantly subrounded gravel and cobbles of sedimentary origin.
Particle-size control section:  18 to 27 percent clay; 50 to 80 percent subrounded rock fragments (predominantly gravel, some cobbles - of sedimentary origin)
Calcium Carbonate Equivalent:  5 to 15 percent

A horizon:
Reaction:  moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline

C horizon:
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma:  3 or 4
Texture:  SCL, L, or FSL with GRX, GRV and CBX modifiers
Rock fragments:  45 to 80 percent total; 25 to 35 percent gravel, 10 to 20 percent cobbles, 5 to 10 percent channers, 5 to 10 percent stones 
Reaction:  moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline 

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chalkcliff (T) and Polychrome series and possibly the Chilton, Happle, and Nihill series not yet updated to the Seventh Edition keys.
Polychrome:  moderately deep to paralithic contact.
Chalkcliff, Happle, and Nihill:  have hues yellower than 7.5YR.
Chilton:  has moisture control sections affected by significant peak periods of precipitation in the late spring and early summer.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Notlic soils.
Parent material:  alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks.
Landform:  alluvial fans.
Slopes:  5 to 15 percent
Elevation:  5,000 to 5,800 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  45 to 49 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  8 to 12 inches.
Frost-free period:  110 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Iogoon, Labyrinth, Pensore, and Wildmount series.  
Iogoon and Labyrinth soils occur on flood plains and are subject to rare flooding and seasonal high water tables at 40 to 60 inches in depth.
Pensore soils occur on hillslopes and are shallow.
Wildmount soils occur on fan remnants and have a calcic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, low to medium runoff, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major uses are livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  The native plant community is Utah juniper, pinyon pine, galleta, needleandthread, black sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Mormon tea.  This soil has been correlated to the Semidesert Stony Loam (Utah Juniper-Pinyon) - 034XY247UT range site at the type location in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeast Utah.  LRR D, MLRA 34.  This series is of small extent.
