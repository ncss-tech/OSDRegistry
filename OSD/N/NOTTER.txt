NOTTER SERIES

Notter series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately or moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium or slope alluvium from intermediate and basic igneous and sedimentary rocks.  Notter soils occur on alluvial fans, mountainsides and structural benches.  Slope ranges from 2 to 40 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture:  Soil moisture control section is usually moist in some part during summer and early fall, and intermittently dry in late fall.  Ustic moisture regime bordering on Aridic.  
Mean annual soil temperature:  40 to 47 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cortyzack, Eldgin, Emlin, Hysoop, Morval, Nuley, Thunderhead, Varney and Villa Grove series.  Cortyzack and Emlin soils have a 25% decline in precipitation in July and August rather than an increase.  Eldgin soils has rock fragments derived from andesite, dacite, basalt, and tuft. Hysoop soils has 0 to 15 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section and hue ranges to 5YR. Morval soils have combined A and Bt horizons that are 24 to 35 inches thick, have fewer rock fragments in the Bk horizon, have a lithologic discontinuity below 46 inches, and occur in a climate that has 16 to 18 inches precipitation.  Nuley soils have gneiss bedrock at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Thunderhead soils have sedimentary bedrock at depths of 22 to 40 inches.  Varney soils do not have peak periods of precipitation in late summer and fall.  Villa Grove soils have a horizon of gypsum accumulation below 44 inches, have exchangeable sodium percentage of 5 to 20% in the argillic horizon and have mean annual precipitation of about 7 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Notter soils are on old alluvial fans, mountainsides and structural benches at elevations of 6,400 to 7,800 feet.  Slopes are 2 to 40 percent.  Notter soils formed in alluvium or slope alluvium from intermediate and basic igneous and sedimentary rocks.  The climate is semiarid.  The mean annual air temperature is 38 to 45 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is 10 to 16 inches.  The freeze-free period is 80 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Glendive, Grimm, and Mauser soils.  Glendive and Grimm soils have an ochric epipedon, and do not have both argillic and calcic horizons.  Glendive soils are coarse-loamy and Grimm soils are sandy-skeletal.  Mauser soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the Bt horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; low to high runoff; moderate and moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is dominantly black sagebrush, blue grama, yellowbrush, pinyon pine, juniper, pigmy sagebrush, Wyoming big sagebrush and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Foothill areas of southern Utah.  The series is inextensive.  MLRA E47 and D34.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 3 to 15 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 15 inches (A, Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Argillic horizon:  The zone from 3 to 15 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Calcic horizon:  The zone from 22 to 60 inches (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)

The assignment of the cation-exchange capacity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
