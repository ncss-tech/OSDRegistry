COMPETING SERIES:
These are Aquapaug soils.
Aquapaug soils--are formed in sandy outwash material and are found on submerged outwash landscapes of freshwater ponds, lakes, and reservoirs in Rhode Island.  Aquapaug soils also do not have hypersulfidic soil materials.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are Gillette Castle, Nott Island, and Thames soils.
Gillette Castle soils--formed in loamy and sandy subaqueous alluvium and are found on river channels and coves in tidal rivers; they are typically in high-energy, freshwater-dominant riverine settings and include an irregular decrease in carbon with depth and have finer textures in the upper part.
Nott Island soils--formed in sulfide-enriched sandy subaqueous alluvium, have electrical conductivity values above 0.6 dS/m, and are found on river channels, shoals, and bars in tidal rivers; typically found near the lower extent of tidal rivers where saltwater influence is greater
Thames soils--are formed in sulfide-enriched mixed coarse-loamy subaqueous alluvium or estuarine deposits, have finer textures, and found on river channels and shoals in tidal rivers

Soil is continuously inundated with brackish or fresh water.

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major uses--Areas of this soil are used for recreational fishing and swimming. Commercial uses include shell fishing and aquaculture. Wildlife use and benthic fauna associated with this soil includes tubeworms, clams, juvenile blue crabs, scallops, and juvenile finfish.
Native vegetation--Eelgrass (Zostera marina) and widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima) may occur on these soils.

REMARKS: This subaqueous series is mapped in areas previously published as water in Connecticut Soil Survey publications.

Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include--
Peraquic feature--Positive soil water potential (permanently submerged) at the soil surface. (under 2 meters of salt water).
Frasi- taxonomic great group--Electrical conductivity (EC 1:5) is less than 0.6 dS/m throughout
Particle-size control section--The zone from 0 to 100 centimeters (0 to 40 inches).
Hypersulfidic materials--The zone from 32 to 128 centimeters (Cseg horizons) have oxidized reactions with pH values less than 4 after 16 weeks.
