NANNYTON SERIES

The Nannyton series consists of very deep, well drained soils with moderte permeability formed in alluvium dominantly from rhyolite, granite and basalt.  They are on in valleys.  Average annual precipitation is about 7 inches and average annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Calciargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Nannyton fine gravelly sandy loam -- on a nearly level remnant fan at 2,425 feet elevation in rangeland (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 2 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine gravelly sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) when moist; weak, fine, granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; 20 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline; abrupt broken boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)

    A2--2 to 7 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) when moist; moderate, thin and very thin platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine vesicular pores; 5 percent gravel; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (1 to 5 inches thick)

    Bt--7 to 14 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) when moist; weak, medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; faint patchy clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent gravel; moderately alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Bk1--14 to 17 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) when moist; weak, medium, subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 7 inches thick)

    Bk2--17 to 23 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) fine sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) when moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; few fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 8 inches thick)

    2Bk3--23 to 27 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) gravelly coarse sandy loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) when moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; 25 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 12 inches thick)

    2Bk4--27 to 39 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) gravelly loamy coarse sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) when moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; 30 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; smooth boundary.  (0 to 20 inches thick)

    3Bk5--39 to 60 inches; grayish-brown (10YR 5/2) fine sand and fine gravel, brown (10YR 4/3) when moist in the fine or matrix portion; much black basalt and other dark minerals in fine gravel and sand; single grain; loose; few fine roots; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cataract, Chattin (T), Grieta, Mack, Mesa, Neiber and Saddle series. Neiber and Saddle soils are 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact.  Cataract soils are 20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact. Grieta soils are 20 to 40 inches to the calcic horizon.  Chattin, Mack and Mesa soils lack sand and/or loamy sand textures above 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nannyton soils are on level to moderately sloping alluvial fans and terraces at elevations of 2,300 to 2,500 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The soils formed in alluvium dominantly from rhyolitic, granitic, and basaltic sources. The climate is arid with very dry summers. Average annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches, including a little snowfall.  Average annual temperature is 53 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 145 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Marsing and Vanderoff soils.  These soils lack argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very slow or slow runoff; moderately permeable.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mannyton soils are used for rangeland, irrigated cropland and pasture.  Crops include corn, small grains and sugar beets. The natural vegetation is mainly shadscale, with some budsage, spiny hopsage, squirreltail, and horsebrush, and in places greasewood.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Idaho; MLRA 11.  Not extensive.
