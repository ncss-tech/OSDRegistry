NUTMEG SERIES

The Nutmeg series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on stream terraces and in drainageways.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rock or tephra.  Slopes are 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

Climate - cold wet winters, cool dry summers
Mean annual air temperature - 39 to 45 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation - 22 to 68 inches
Frost-free period - 5 to 35 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Anniecreek, Oatman, Pokegema and Woodcock soils.  
Anniecreek soils are somewhat poorly drained, have an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth and lack andic soil properties.  
Oatman soils are well drained and have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the thickest portion of the particle-size control section.  
Pokegema soils are well drained and lack redoximorphic concentrations.  
Woodcock soils are well drained and have an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage - moderately well
Permeability - moderately rapid
Watertable - a seasonal water table is at its uppermost limit in May or June, and present May to August

USE AND VEGETATION:  Nutmeg soils are used for wildlife habitat, watershed and recreation.  The potential natural plant community is the Engelmann spruce/bride's bonnet plant association.  Common overstory species include Engelmann spruce, lodgepole pine, white fir, black cottonwood or quaking aspen.  Common understory species include bride's bonnet, common snowberry, gray alder, Saskatoon serviceberry or rose spirea.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Klamath County, Oregon; MLRA 3.  Series is of small extent.
