NOWACK SERIES

The Nowack series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and colluvium over residuum derived from andesite or tuff. Nowack soils are on mountains. Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TYPE LOCATION: Modoc County, California; on the Modoc National Forest in the Warner Mountains; 2,100 feet north and 1,100 feet west of the southeast corner of section 21, T 47N, R 15E; Willow Ranch USGS  7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; 41 degrees 55 minutes 38.4 seconds north latitude and 120 degrees 15 minutes 12.5 seconds west longitude, NAD27. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture - These soils are usually moist in winter, spring, and early summer, dry later in summer and fall; xeric soil moisture regime. 
Mean annual soil temperature - 41 to 45 degrees F.
Mean summer soil temperature - 47 to 54 degrees F. 
Oxalate extractable Al + 1/2 Fe: 0.4 to 1 percent.
Volcanic glass content - 50 to 80 percent in the coarse silt through fine sand fractions. 
Umbric epipedon thickness - 14 to 20 inches. 
Depth to bedrock - 40 to 60 inches to a paralithic contact. The paralithic materials below the contact are weathered pyroclastic andesite, andesitic tuff or tuff-breccia. 
Profile reaction - Moderately acid or slightly acid.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 18 to 27 percent, (field estimates).
Rock fragments: Average 35 to 60 percent, mainly gravel or cobbles. 

A horizon - Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR.
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.
Rock fragments: Averages 35 to 60 percent, mainly gravel or cobbles.
Organic matter content: 1 to 4 percent.
 
Bt horizon - Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR.
Texture: Ashy loam or ashy sandy clay loam.
Clay content: 18 to 27 percent.
Rock fragments: Averages 35 to 60 percent, some subhorizons have more than 60 percent rock fragments in the lower part.
Structure: Moderate or strong, fine to coarse subangular blocky.
 
COMPETING SERIES: There are currently no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nowack soils are on mountains. They formed in volcanic ash and colluvium over residuum derived from andesite, tuff-breccia or andesitic tuff. Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 5,130 to 8,450 feet. The climate is subhumid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 40 inches, most of which comes as snow. The mean annual temperature is 38 to 44 degrees F. The frost-free period is 50 to 80 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Lyonman and Paynepeak series. Lyonman soils have bedrock within 20 to 40 inches. Paynepeak soils have a mollic epipedon and cryic soil temperature regime. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium or high surface runoff; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Nowack soils are used for timber production, watershed, wildlife habitat, and limited livestock grazing. The vegetation consists of a closed forest canopy of white fir with an understory of perennial forbs, bluegrass, sedge and currant. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern California. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 21.
