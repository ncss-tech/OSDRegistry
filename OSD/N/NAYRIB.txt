NAYRIB SERIES

The Nayrib series consists of very shallow, well drained soils on pressure ridges of basalt plains.  These soils have formed in eolian deposits from mixed sources.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Nayrib very cobbly fine sandy loam - on a 4 percent convex slope.  When described on August 27, l980, the profile was moist throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A1--0 to 4 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 7 percent stones, 25 percent cobbles, and 20 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)

     A2--4 to 8 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 5 percent stones, 25 percent cobbles, and 20 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 4 inches thick)

     2R--8 inches; unweathered vesicular basalt.

TYPE LOCATION:  Fremont County, Idaho; about 12 miles northwest of St.  Anthony; 2,170 feet east and 100 feet south of the northwest corner of sec. 26, T.9N., R.38E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Depth to bedrock and thickness of mollic epipedon - 6 to 10 inches

Clay content of control section - 12 to 18 percent

Rock fragments in control section - 35 to 80 percent

Average annual soil temperature - about 43 to 45 degrees F

Summer soil temperature - 60 to 63 degrees F

A horizon

Color value, dry - 4 or 5

value, moist - 2 or 3

chroma - 2 or 3, dry or moist

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Agassiz, Anatone, Bocker, Cedaran, Falula, Foxol, Gando, Little Pole, Rexmont, Swanner, and Van Wagoner series.  All of these soils, except Bocker, are deeper than 10 inches.  Agassiz, Cedaran, Foxol, and Little Pole soils have a cambic horizon.  Falula, Gando, and Grink soils have lime in the lower part of the profile.   Bocker soils have a B horizon and more than 18 percent clay in the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nayrib soils are on pressure ridges of undulating basalt plains.  The soils formed in eolian deposits.  Frost free season is 80 to 100 days.  Average annual temperature is 41 to 43 degrees F.  Elevation is 5,000 to 5,500 feet.  Average annual precipitation is 12 to 17 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Blacknoll, Jipper, Snowshoe, Stipe and Wolverine soils.  All of these soils are deeper than 10 inches.  All of these soils except Wolverine have a cambic horizon.  Wolverine soils are fine sand throughout.  Blacknoll, Jipper and Stipe are adjacent soils on the basalt plains.  Snowshoe and Wolverine soils are on stabilized dunes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; permeability is
moderately rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Principal vegetation consists of mountain big sagebrush, needleandthread grass, bitterbrush, rabbitbrush, and pricklypear cactus.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Nayrib soils are of small extent.   They are in eastern Idaho.
