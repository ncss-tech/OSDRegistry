Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include--Peraquic feature--The zone from 0 to 200 centimeters has positive soil water potential (permanently submerged) at the soil surface (under 2 meters of salt water).
Particle--size control section-The zone from 0 to 100 centimeters (0 to 40 inches)
Ochric epipedon--0 to 14 centimeters (0 to 6 inches, A horizon).
Sulfidic soil materials--within 100 centimeters of the mineral soil surface, 41 to 54 centimeters and 69 to 74 centimeters (Aseb and A'seb horizons).

ADDITIONAL DATA:
