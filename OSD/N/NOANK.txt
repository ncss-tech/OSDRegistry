USE AND VEGETATION:
Major uses--The area is used for recreational fishing and swimming. Commercial uses include shell fishing and aquaculture.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: New London County, Connecticut, 2024.

REMARKS: This subaqueous series is mapped in areas previously mapped as water in the soil survey publications of Connecticut.

Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include-
Peraquic feature--The zone from 0 to 200 centimeters has positive soil water potential (permanently submerged) at the soil surface (under 2 meters of salt water).
Particle-size control section--The zone from 0 to 100 centimeters (0 to 40 inches)
Sulfidic soil materials--Within 100 centimeters of the mineral soil surface, 78 to 200 centimeters (Cseg4, Cseg5, Cseg6, and Cseg7 horizons).
