NGERUNGOR SERIES

The Ngerungor series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils in depressions on wet coastal bottom lands. These soils formed in deposits of organic material overlying coral sand. Slope is 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual rainfall ranges about 3683 millimeters (145 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 27 degrees C. (81 degrees F.) 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Euic, isohyperthermic Typic Haplohemists

TYPICAL PEDON: Ngerungor peaty muck - in a level area supporting wetland taro, hydrophytic grass, and sedge vegetation. When described (2/6/80), the soil was saturated throughout. The water table was at the surface. (Colors are for moist soil). 

 Oe1--0 to 38 centimeters (0 to 15 inches); dark reddish brown (5YR 2.5/2) hemic material; 55 percent fiber, 25 percent rubbed; massive; nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots and few medium and coarse roots; color is 7.5YR 7/4 in pyrophosphate; very strongly acid (pH 4.5, 1:1 in calcium chloride); gradual wavy boundary. 30 to 79 centimeters (12 to 31 inches) thick} 

 Oe2--38 to 102 centimeters (15 to 40 inches); black (10YR 2/1) hemic material; about 58 percent fiber; 33 percent rubbed; massive; nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots and few medium and coarse roots; color is 7.5YR 7/4 in pyrophosphate; moderately acid (pH 5.9, 1:1 in calcium chloride); gradual smooth boundary. 89 to 130 centimeters (35 to 51 inches) thick} 

 Oe3--102 to 150 centimeters (40 to 59 inches); dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) hemic material; about 68 percent fiber, 30 percent rubbed; massive; nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots and few medium and coarse roots; color is 7.5YR 7/4 color by pyrophosphate test; moderately acid (pH 5.6, 1:1 in calcium chloride). 

TYPE LOCATION: Peleliu Municipality, Island of Palau, Western Caroline Islands, about .2 mile NNE. of Peleliu airstrip, turn left at road junction and proceed 623 feet NNW. Site is 98 feet SW. of roadway; lat. 7 degrees 0 minutes 15 seconds N. and long. 134 degrees 15 minutes 2.5 seconds E. (WGS 84 datum) 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the water table ranges from 0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches). 

Thickness of the O horizon ranges from 127 centimeters (50 inches) to more than 150 centimeters (59 inches). This horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Rubbed fiber content throughout the profile ranges from 20 to 40 percent by volume. Reaction in calcium chloride ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid, but maybe neutral next to the sandy substratum. 

A 2C horizon may be present in some pedons and has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8, and chroma of 1 through 4. It is sand or loamy sand and is gravelly in some pedons. It is 0 to 15 percent gravel up to 8 centimeters (3 inches) in size. A thin mucky transitional layer is present in some pedons. Reaction in 1:1 water is neutral through moderately alkaline. 

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ngerungor soils are in depressions and on wet coastal bottom lands. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. They formed in deposits of organic material overlying coral sand. Elevation is sea level to 10 meters (33 feet). The mean annual rainfall is from 3,150 millimeters to 4,978 millimeters (124 to 196 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 27 degrees C. (81 degrees F.) 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Dublon series. Dublon soils are sandy, carbonatic throughout the profile and have a freshwater table ranging from 38 to 91 centimeters (15 to 36 inches). 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained; ponded or very slow runoff; rapid permeability. A fluctuating water table ranges from 0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches) below the surface. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of these soils are used for the production of wetland taro. Unused areas are in hydrophytic grasses (Phraymytes sp.) and sedges. The dominant vegetation in Kosrae is swamp forest, consisting mainly of Barringtonia racemosa, Horsfieldia nunu and Terminalia carolinensis. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Ngerungor soils are on Angaur and Peleliu islands in Palau, on the Truk Islands, and on the island of Kosrae. The series is of small extent.
