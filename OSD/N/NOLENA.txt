NOLENA SERIES

The Nolena series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from granite or altered granite rock sources. Nolena soils are on mountains, hills and rock pediments. Slope ranges from 4 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, nonacid, thermic, shallow Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Nolena extremely gravelly sandy loam, wildlife habitat. (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered with approximately 60 percent pebbles and 15 percent cobbles. 

	A--0 to 2 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial and few fine tubular pores; 60 percent pebbles and 10 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick) 

	C--2 to 5 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; common fine interstitial and few fine tubular pores; 70 percent pebbles; few faint colloidal stains on sand grains; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual smooth boundary. (3 to 12 inches thick) 

	Cr--5 to 11 inches; weathered granite bedrock, 70 percent rock structure; gradual wavy boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick) 

	R--11 inches; hard granite bedrock. 

TYPE LOCATION: Clark County, Nevada; about 8 miles west of Laughlin, NV, in the southern end of the Newberry Mountains; about 1,970 feet north and 70 feet west of the southeast corner of section 19, T. 32 S., R. 64 E.; 35 degrees, 8 minutes, 36 seconds north latitude and 114 degrees, 45 minutes, 39 seconds west longitude; USGS Juniper Mine, NV 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle. UTM zone 11, 702282e, 3890534n. NAD27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil moisture - Usually dry, moist in some part for short periods during winter and early spring and for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July to October following convection storms. Has an aridic moisture regime. 

Soil temperature - 59 to 65 degrees F. 

Depth to paralithic contact - 4 to 14 inches. 

Depth to lithic contact - 10 to 20 inches. 

Reaction - Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. 

Control section - Clay content: Averages 8 to 18 percent. 

Rock fragments: Averages 60 to 70 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent stones, with half of the pebbles in the 2 to 5 millimeter fraction. 

A horizon - Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist. 

Chroma: 3 or 4. 

Other features - Noneffervescent in some pedons. 

C horizon - Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR. 

Value: 5 or 6 dry. 

Chroma: 3 or 4. 

Structure: Subangular blocky or massive. 

Texture of fine earth: Coarse sandy loam or sandy loam. 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Fig (AZ) and Wikieup(T AZ) series. The Fig soils lack a lithic contact. Wikieup soils contain 35 to 60 percent rock fragment in the control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nolena soils are on mountains, hills and rock pediments. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from granite and altered granitic rock sources. Slope ranges from 4 to 75 percent. Elevations are 2,500 to 5,300 feet. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and hot, intermittently moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 7 inches. The mean annual temperature is 57 to 63 degrees F., and the frost free season is 180 to 240 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Cetrepas soil. Cetrepas soils have argillic horizons and mean annual soil temperature of 55 to 58 degrees F. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; very high runoff; moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly blackbrush, Mojave buckwheat, range ratany and creosotebush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southern Nevada; MLRA 30. These soils are moderately extensive.
