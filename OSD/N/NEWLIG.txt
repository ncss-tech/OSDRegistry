NEWLIG SERIES

The Newlig series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in Missoula Flood deposits with an admixture of loess. Newlig soils are on terraces and footslopes above terraces and have slopes of 5 to 20 percent. Permeability is moderate.  The average annual precipitation is about 26 inches and the average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Pachic Ultic Argixerolls  

TYPICAL PEDON:  Newlig silt loam, forested, - on a 9 percent slope at an elevation of 1,150 feet. Aspect is southwest. When described on December 1, 1999, the soil was moist throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Aptos, Buckeye, Campfour, Cartwright (T), Elmore, Hyprairie, Kiakus, Lauby, Nisene, Paragon, Roseburg, Rudo (T), Swalecreek (T), and Yaxing series. Aptos and Paragon soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Buckeye and Kiakus soils are moderatley deep to a lithic contact. Campfour soils formed in residuum or colluvium from andesite or basalt, and have moist hues of 5YR or 2.5YR, have 27 to 35 percent clay and 5 to 30 percent gravel in the argillic horizon. Cartwright soils have 5 to 25 percent gravel in the argillic horizon, are in a 15 to 22 inch precipitation zone, and formed in colluvium and alluvium from granite. Elmore soils are deep to a lithic contact. Hyprairie soils have a lithologic discontinuity. Lauby soils have buried argillic horizons. Nisene and Rudo soils are deep to a paralithic contact. Roseburg soils have a BCt horizon and are in a 30 to 60 inch precipitation zone. Swalecreek soils have Bat and Btc horizons. Yaxing soils are slightly alkaline in the particle-size control section, are in a 16 to 18 inch precipitation zone, and formed in material weathered from sandstone.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Newlig  soils are on terraces and footslopes above terraces at elevations of 920 feet to 1,240 feet and have slopes of 5 to 20 percent.  These soils developed in Missoula Flood deposits with an admixture of loess. The average annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 23 to 28 inches and the frost-free season is 110 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Gwin, Longpen, Kettenbach, Keuterville and Seddow soils. Gwin, Kettenbach and Keuterville soils are found on canyon sideslopes and are loamy-skeletal.  Longpen and Seddow soils are found on canyon benches and plateaus and have ochric epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; runoff is medium to rapid; permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION:  This soil is primarily used for cropland, pasture, homesite development, wildlife habitat and limited timber production.  The natural vegetation is mainly ponderosa pine, black hawthorn, and scattered Douglas-fir with an understory of common snowberry, bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, pine reedgrass, elksedge, Columbia brome and low Oregon grape.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Clearwater County, Idaho.  The series is of small extent.
