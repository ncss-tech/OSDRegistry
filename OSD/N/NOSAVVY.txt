NOSAVVY SERIES

The Nosavvy series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and colluvium from volcanic rocks. Nosavvy soils are on plateaus and escartments. Slopes are 30 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nosavvy soils are on plateau sideslopes and escarpments. These soils formed in volcanic ash and colluvium from volcanic rocks. Slopes are 30 to 50 percent. Elevations are 1,375 to 2,010 meters. The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 7.2 to 10.0 degrees C. and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Saraph and Tuffo series. Saraph soils are shallow to tuff. Tuffo soils are shallow to tuff and lack argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium or high runoff; moderate saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Rangeland and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is Lahontan sagebrush and Thurber's needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Washoe County, Nevada, Surprise Valley-Home Camp Area; MLRA 23. These soils are not extensive.
