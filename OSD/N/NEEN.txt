NEEN SERIES 

The Neen series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, saline soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains, stream terraces and drainageways.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Calciustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Neen silty clay loam, native grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).
