NITPAC SERIES

The Nitpac series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Nitpac soils are on plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7.8 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  At present, there are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nitpac soils are on plateaus.  They formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 4,800 to 6,310 feet. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7.2 to 8.3 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bidrim, Devada, Jaybee, Uhaldi, and Tunnison soils.  Bidrim and Devada soils are clayey, shallow to lithic contacts, and have Mollic epipedons and argillic horizons.  Jaybee soils are loamy, very shallow and shallow to lithic contacts, and have ochric epipedons and argillic horizons.  Uhaldi soils are fine-loamy, moderately deep to paralithic contacts, and have Mollic epipedons and argillic horizons.  Tunnison soils are very-fine, moderately deep to paralithic contacts, and have deep vertical cracks that extend to the soil surface.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high surface runoff; very slow saturated hydraulic conductivity (low or moderately low saturated hydraulic saturated hydraulic conductivity).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Nitpac soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is dominantly low sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Thurber's needlegrass, and antelope bitterbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Nevada and northeastern California.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 23.
