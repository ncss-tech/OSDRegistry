Numa soils are on terraces and paleoterraces. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 305 millimeters (12 inches). The mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C. (52 degrees F).

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Prowers County, Colorado, 1963.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section: 0 to 200 centimeters
Particle size control section: 25 to 100 centimeters (10 to 40 inches)
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 25 centimeters (0 to 10 inches). (Ap1 horizon)
Calcic horizon: 48 to 87 centimeters (19 to 34 inches). (Bk1 horizon)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

LAN 3/2013 The previous classification of Ustic Haplocalcids became obsolete after a field project indicated that these soils had mollic epipedons.  Based on this project the type location was moved from Prowers County, Colorado to Otero County, Colorado and changes the Taxonomic class to Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Calciustolls.
