NARON SERIES

The Naron series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy eolian sediments. These soils are on rolling small dunes on paleoterraces in river valleys of the Great Bend Sand Plains, MLRA 79. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 700 millimeters (28 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 14 degrees C (57 degrees F), at the type location.
