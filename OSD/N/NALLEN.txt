MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Fayette County, West Virginia, 2009. 

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 20 cm (A and BA horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 23 to 48 cm (Bt horizon) 
Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 86 cm 
This series is proposed to cover areas in MLRA 127 previously mapped as Lily in published surveys, or Dekalb in out-of-date surveys. The preponderance of data from a variety of pedons sampled as Lily or Clymer in MLRA 127 indicated a need for the establishment of this series. 

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Characterization data from the NSSL is available for this pedon: Pedon ID: 01N1148 (S01WV019003). Other valuable reference pedons available from the NSSL (http://ssldata.nrcs.usda.gov/querypage.asp): 01N1140, 01N1150, 01N1155, 01N1156, 40A4070, 80PO351, 80PO352.
