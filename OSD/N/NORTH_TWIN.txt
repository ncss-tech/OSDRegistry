DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--moderately well drained--a frequently saturated zone occurs between depths of 0.6 and 1.0 meter during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of 30 year mean of annual precipitation, this saturation is both perched and apparent based on the season and intensity of rainfall during a given period

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters; series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 25 centimeters (Ap horizon);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 25 to 46 centimeters and the zone from a depth of 79 to 203 centimeters (Bt, BCkg, BCk1, and BCk2 horizons); 
calcic horizon--the zone from a depth of 46 to 79 centimeters (Bk horizon).

Some pedons have a sandy or coarse-loamy lag line about 10 centimeters thick with or without gravel at the base of the solum.
 
The BC horizon is defined by having prismatic primary structure parting to angular or subangular blocky.  This structure is evident in pits and cutbanks and rarely observed by boring tubes. The change to moist bulk density of 1.45 to 1.65 g/cc was based on lab data and field investigations by soil scientists of similar soils on this geomorphic landform of the Coteau des Prairies bench".

Based on current investigations, elevation ranges in MLRA 103 is about 270 to 480 meter above sea level. However, the elevation data in the 2006 issue of USDA Handbook 296, has not been changed to agree with this elevation data.
 
Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

Oxyaquic subgroup based on a zone of saturation within 100 centimeters for 20 or more consecutive days or 30 or more cumulative days in normal years.
