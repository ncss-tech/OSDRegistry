NEW CAMBRIA SERIES

The New Cambria series consists of deep moderately well drained soils.  These soils formed in alluvium on stream terraces or flood plains in the Rolling Plains and Breaks, MLRA 73. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 12 degrees C (53 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is 685 millimeters (27 inches).  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Cumulic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  New Cambria silty clay is in a cultivated field.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

(Combined thickness of the Bw horizon is 40 to 90 centimeters (16 to 35 inches) thick)

  C1--81 to 109 centimeters (32 to 43 inches); gray (10YR 5/1) silty clay loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; structureless massive; very hard, firm; many very-fine pores; few fine roots; many films and threads of calcium carbonate; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  

  C2--109 to 200 centimeters (43 to 80 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; structureless massive; very hard, firm; many films and threads of calcium carbonate, many fine non-cemented calcium carbonate masses; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Shay series.
Shay soils are somewhat poorly drained and have an Aridic soil moisture regime. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform: stream terraces or floodplains
Slope: 0 to 2 percent

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are Bogue, Detroit, Muir and Roxbury soils. 
Bogue soils are on adjacent uplands and are underlain by clayey shales.
Detroit soils are on similar landforms and have an increase in illuvial clay in the particle size control section (an argillic horizon). 
Muir and Roxbury soils are on similar landforms and have less than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage: moderately well
