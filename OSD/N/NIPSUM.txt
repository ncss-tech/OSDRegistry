NIPSUM SERIES

The Nipsum series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey and loamy alluvium and colluvium. These soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping drainageways and terraces on uplands in the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78B, 78C). Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 610 mm (24 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 17 degrees C (62 degrees F)

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, thermic Cumulic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Nipsum clay--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  A--10 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in); brown (10YR 4/3) clay, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky and weak fine granular structure; hard, friable; few fine and medium roots; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (Thickness is 18 to 38 cm [7 to 15 in]).

  A2--25 to 76 cm (10 to 30 in); brown (7.5YR 5/2) clay, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; common roots; many very fine pores; common wormcasts; few films and threads of calcium carbonate; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (Thickness is 25 to 61 cm [10 to 24 in]).

  Bk1--76 to 122 cm (30 to 48 in); reddish brown (5YR 5/4) clay, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; about 3 percent by volume of calcium carbonate concretions; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (Thickness is 20 to 76 cm [8 to 30 in]).

  Bk2--122 to 152  cm (48 to 60 in); reddish brown (5YR 5/4) clay, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; common fine concretions and masses of calcium carbonate and gypsum crystals; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Clearfork and Westfork series. Similar soils include the Frio, Krum, Miller, Nukrum, Rioconcho, and Volente series.
Clearfork and Westfork soils are on floodplains. Westfork soils are in areas of higher precipitation.
Frio soils are on floodplains in areas of higher precipitation and have smectitic mineralogy.
Krum and Nukrum soils have vertic properties and smectitic mineralogy.
Miller and Rioconcho soils are on floodplains and have vertic properties.
Volente soils have a solum thickness less than 60 inches, a regular decrease in organic carbon, and fragments of limestone within 122 to 183 cm (48 to 72 in).
