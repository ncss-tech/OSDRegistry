NEZ PERCE SERIES

The Nez Perce series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed mainly in loess. Nez Perce soils are on loess-covered basalt plateaus and have slopes of 0 to 25 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 21 inches.  The average annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chicane, Conley, Kooskia, Lookingglass, and Shebang series. Chicane soils have a mollic  epipedon more than 20 inches thick, a cambic horizon above the albic horizon, and lack iron-manganese concretions larger than 2mm in the albic horizon and above a depth of about 40 inches. Conley soils have A1 or Ap horizons 10 inches or less thick, an E horizon that separates horizons making up the mollic epipedon, are somewhat poorly drained, and may have mottles in the E and B2 horizons. Kooskia soils have chroma of 1.5 or more in the upper 7 inches and lack chroma of 2 or mottles or iron-manganese concretions larger than 2mm in the albic horizon.  Lookingglass soils do not have accumulations of secondary carbonates in the Bt horizon.  Shebang soils have a mollic epipedon 7 to 12 inches thick and are 8 to 14 inches deep to the argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nez Perce soils are on loess-covered  hills and basalt plateaus at elevations of 2,600 to 4,100 feet and have slopes from 0 to 25 percent. They formed in loess, although the lower part may be formed in material weathered from the underlying basalt. The climate is subhumid with an average annual precipitation of 19 to 24 inches including 4 to 7 feet of snow. Peak precipitation is in May and June and minimum precipitation in July and August. The average annual air temperature is 44 to 48 degrees F.  The average frost-free season (32 degrees F.) ranges from about 100 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Fenn and Ferdinand soils and the competing Chicane soils. Fenn soils lack an E horizon, have many slickensides and wedge-shaped aggregates in the Bt horizon, and lack an abrupt textural change. Ferdinand soils have clayey-skeletal Bt horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; medium or rapid runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Soils are cultivated. Winter wheat, winter peas, barley, hay, and pasture are the principal crops. The natural vegetation is mainly Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, sticky geranium, silky lupine, and arrowleaf balsamroot.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Idaho and eastern Washington. The series is extensive.
