NEBOPEAK SERIES

Nebopeak series consists of very deep, well-drained soils on midslopes of lateral moraines on glaciated mountains. Nebopeak soils formed in a thin mantle of volcanic ash over till predominantly from basalt. Slopes are 30 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and mean annual temperature about 37 degrees F.
