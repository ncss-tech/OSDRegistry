NIOTAZE SERIES

The Niotaze series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in residuum from weathered shale and colluvium from sandstone of Pennsylvanian age. These gently sloping to steep soils are on hillslopes of hills and cuestas in the Northern Cross Timbers (MLRA 84A). Slope ranges from 3 to 45 percent. At the type location the mean annual temperature is 15 degrees C (59 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 1067 mm (42 in).

Bates soils: are on higher summits, have mollic epipedons, are fine-loamy, and have sandstone at depths of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 in)
Bigheart and Coweta soils: are on shoulder slopes adjoining Niotaze soils but have sandstone within a depth of 51 cm (20 in); in addition, Coweta soils have mollic epipedons
Prue soils: are on colluvial footslopes below the Niotaze soils, and are fine-loamy and very deep
Steedman soils: are on similar slopes, but do not have E horizons, are more alkaline in the Bt and BC horizons, and have prairie vegetation
Wewoka soils: are on broad to narrow summits and interfluves and have a sandy-skeletal control section 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage: somewhat poorly drained 
Permeability: slow 
Runoff:  medium on slopes 1 to 3 percent and high on slopes greater than 3 percent. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Primarily as native range pasture and woodland. The native vegetation is a savannah consisting of post oak, blackjack oak, red oak, hickory, other udic trees, and an understory of tall grasses. The aspect may range from rangeland or sparse savannah to woodland, depending on management. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeast Kansas, north-central and north-eastern Oklahoma. LRR J; MLRA 84A. These soils are extensive, about 350,000 acres. About 300,000 acres is in Oklahoma with the balance in Kansas. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Chautauqua County, Kansas, March l972. 

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons recognized in the pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 10 cm (0 to 10 in) (A and E horizon) 
Argillic horizon: 25 to 46 cm (10 to 18 in) (2Bt horizon) 
Abrupt texture change: clay increase greater than 20 percent absolute within 7.5 cm (3 in) from the E to Bt horizon 
Laboratory data by Oklahoma State University and NSSL is available on these soils. 

These soils in Chautauqua County, Kansas are on hillslopes of strongly dissected landscapes of shale with lenses and outcrops of sandstone. Surface creep has distributed fragments of sandstone over the surface of the soil in most locations and the loamier A and E horizons have developed in this material while the clayey B horizons have developed in material from the underlying shale. Discontinuous stone lines are common at top of the argillic horizon. 

ADDITIONAL DATA: KSSL and Oklahoma State University indicate that the mineralogy is variable across the series and geological range. Both smectitic and mixed pedons have been sampled.
