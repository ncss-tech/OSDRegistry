NORTHCOTE SERIES

The Northcote series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in clayey calcareous lacustrine sediments on glacial lake plains.  These soils have slow permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 575 mm. Mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Very-fine, smectitic, frigid Typic Epiaquerts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Northcote clay with plane level slope on a lake plain in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

 Ap--0 to 23 centimeters; black (N 2/0) clay, very dark gray (N 3/0) dry; strong medium and fine subangular blocky structure; very sticky and very plastic; many fine and very fine roots;  many very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear irregular boundary. 

 Bg--23 to 51 centimeters; 80 percent dark gray (5Y 4/1) and 20 percent very dark gray (2.5Y 3/1) clay; strong very coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky; firm; very sticky and very plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; few tongues of black (N 2/0) A material in vertical cracks ranging from 5 to 15 mm in width; strong effervescence; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual irregular boundary.

 BCgss--122 to 145 centimeters; olive gray (5Y 4/2) clay; common medium prominent olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) redoximorphic concentrations; weak very coarse subangular blocky structure; firm; very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; few intersecting slickensides tilted 25 to 60 degrees from horizontal; strong effervescence; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary. 

 Cg--145 to 200 centimeters; dark gray (5Y 4/1) clay; common fine prominent olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) redoximorphic concentrations; massive; firm; very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; few slickensides; common fine and medium white (10YR 8/1) gypsum nests on horizontal faces of peds; few irregularly shaped white (10YR 8/1) masses of carbonates on ped faces; strong effervescence; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The Eaglepoint soils. 
Eaglepoint-- are on low convex knolls and are in a complex pattern with the Northcote soils

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class--poorly and very poorly drained--an apparent seasonal high water table is from 30 to 91 centimeters below the surface from April through July in most years. Ponded map units have a water table as high as 30 centimeters above to 30 centimeters below the surface at some time during the year. 
Runoff--very slow or ponded 
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--<0.1 micrometers per second (very low to low)  

USE AND VEGETATION: The soils are nearly all cultivated and cropped to small grains, sugar beets, and sunflowers. Native vegetation is tall grass prairie.  Crop selection is limited in some areas due to soil salinity.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Physiographic Division--Interior Plains 
Physiographic Province--Central Lowland 
Physiographic section--Western Lake section 
MLRA--Red River Valley of the North (56)
LRR-Northern Great Plains Spring Wheat Region (F)
Extent--large
