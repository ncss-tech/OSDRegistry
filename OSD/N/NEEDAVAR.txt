NEEDAVAR SERIES

The Needavar series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks with additions of aeolian volcanic ash.  Needavar soils are on lake terraces. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TYPE LOCATION: Mono County, California; in the Bodie Hills about 10 kilometers northeast of Kirkwood Spring; about 1,500 feet north and 2,100 feet east of the southwest corner, section 16, T. 4 N., T 28 E.; USGS Kirkwood Spring 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 12 minutes 11.8 seconds N and longitude 118 degrees 53 minutes 42.3 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.2032778 latitude, -118.8950833 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually moist in winter and spring, dry from July through October; aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric. 
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 25 to 36 cm thick.
Depth to moderately cemented duripan: 50 to 100 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 35 to 50 percent. 
Rock fragments: Averages 0 to 15 percent, mainly gravel.  Lithology of rock fragments is mainly andesite and related volcanic rocks.

A horizons
Value: 5 dry, 3 moist, may be 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist in A1 horizon.  High values are due to the high volume of volcanic glass.  Value is 5 or less dry and 3 or less moist in the upper 18 cm when mixed.
Chroma: 2 or 3 dry, or moist.
Organic matter content: 1 to 2 percent.
Volcanic glass content: 50 to 75 percent in coarse silt through medium sand fractions.
Reaction: Slightly acid or neutral.

Bt horizons
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR.
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 3 or 4 dry, or moist.
Texture: Clay loam, clay or gravelly clay loam.
Clay content: 35 to 50 percent.
Rock fragments: Less than 15 percent.
Organic matter content: 0.5 to 1 percent.
Reaction: Neutral or slightly alkaline.

2Bqm horizon
Cementation: Moderately cemented, but broken in some places by burrowing animals.

2Bq horizons
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR.
Texture: Very gravelly ashy sandy loam.
Clay content: Averages 8 to 12 percent.
Rock fragments: 35 to 60 percent.
Silica cementation: 30 to 50 percent moderately cemented durinodes or lenses.
Volcanic glass content: 30 to 75 percent in coarse silt through fine sand fractions.
Reaction: Neutral or slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Babala and Pinchey series. Babala soils have bedrock within depths of 56 to 160 cm, have less than 40 percent volcanic glass in their A horizons and have secondary calcium carbonate in their duripan. Pinchey soils have 25 to 35 percent rock fragments in their particle-size control section, have less than 50 percent volcanic glass in their A horizons and have an indurated duripan. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Needavar soils are on lake terraces. They typically occur on summit positions.  They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources with additions of Aeolian volcanic ash. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 2,100 to 2,320 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Adamatt, Bodiehill and Domehill series. Adamatt, Bodiehill and Domehill soils have less than 35 percent clay and more than 35 percent rock fragments in their particle-size control section, and do not have a duripan.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; high surface runoff; slow permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Needavar soils are used for livestock grazing, recreation, watershed and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, western needlegrass, basin wildrye and needleandthread.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern California, east of the Sierra Nevada Range. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 26.
