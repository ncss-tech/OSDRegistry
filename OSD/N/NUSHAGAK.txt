NUSHAGAK SERIES

The Nushagak series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in organic material over loess on talfs of plains. Slopes range from 0 to 11 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 625 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 0.6 degree C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, isotic, acid Histic Cryaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Nushagak mucky peat, located on a plain talf with a slope of 2 percent and elevation of 19 meters; when described on September 10th, 2007 the soil was moist to 26 cm and saturated below 26 cm (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted)

 Oe--0 to 26 cm; mucky peat; nonsticky, nonplastic; many fine roots, many medium roots, and many very fine roots; very strongly acid (pH 4.5); clear smooth boundary

 A--26 to 31 cm; dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) silt loam; 18 percent sand; 77 percent silt; 5 percent clay; weak medium granular structure; nonsticky, nonplastic; many fine roots, many medium roots, and many very fine roots; very strongly acid (pH 4.5); clear smooth boundary

 Cg--31 to 183 cm; dark greenish gray (5GY 4/1) very fine sandy loam; 47 percent sand; 49 percent silt; 4 percent clay; massive; nonsticky, nonplastic; 25 percent coarse brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist, masses of oxidized iron with clear boundaries; strongly acid (pH 5.3)
