NONA SERIES

The Nona series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits of the Lissie Formation of early to mid-Pleistocene age.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 19.5 degrees C (67 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1295 mm (51 in).

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle size control section: 48 to 99 cm (19 to 39 in).  (Btg/Eg1 and Btg/Eg2 horizons)

Glossic horizon: 48 to 203 cm (19 to 80 in). (Btg/Eg1, Btg/Eg2, Btg/Eg3, Btg/Eg4 horizons)

Other features: 

Vermic feature: 8 to 48 cm (3 to 19 in), 50 percent or more or crawfish bioturbation (Bg horizons)
Aquic conditions: These soils remain saturated and have aquic conditions from November to April from the surface to 30 cm (1 ft) in most years.

Additional Comments: The classification was changed in April 2000 from Typic Vermaqualfs to Natric Vermaqualfs due to lab data from the series type location from Hardin County, Texas. A study of salinity levels was conducted on this and other soils to determine the amount of seasonal variability. During the wetter time of year, ESP levels are typically 1 to 3 points lower than the drier time. 

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data number (S96TX-199-008) from series type location in Hardin County, Texas.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Data available from Texas A&M University (TAMU) Soil Characterization Lab on sample (S96TX-199-008) from the series type location in Hardin County, Texas. NSSL data from salinity study on lab samples 02N0323,02N0324, and 02N0325. Additional data from TAMU on sample S00-TX241-002 from Jasper County.
