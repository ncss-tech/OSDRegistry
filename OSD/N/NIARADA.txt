NIARADA SERIES 

The Niarada series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till, alluvium, colluvium and glacial drift.  These soils are on stream terraces, dissected alluvial fans, hills, and moraines.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Haploxerolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Niarada gravelly loam, pastureland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Ap--0 to 7 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; few pores; 25 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.

    A--7 to 14 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots, common medium roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 35 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (Combined A horizon thickness is 7 to 16 inches)

    Bw--14 to 18 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots, and common medium roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 50 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 13 inches thick) 

    Bk1--18 to 29 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) very gravelly loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots, and few medium roots; few fine and very fine tubular pores; 50 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; disseminated lime, common distinct coatings of lime on undersides and sides of gravel; violently effervescence; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary. (8 to 18 inches thick) 

    Bk2--29 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; 50 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; disseminated lime, common distinct coatings of lime covering gravel; violently effervescence; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).
