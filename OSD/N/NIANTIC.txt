SERIES ESTABLISHED: Fairfield County, Connecticut, 2024.

REMARKS: This subaqueous series is mapped in areas previously published as water in the soil survey publications of Connecticut.

Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include--
Peraquic feature--Positive soil water potential (permanently submerged) at the soil surface. (under 2 meters of salt water).
Particle-size control section--The zone from 0 to 100 centimeters (0 to 40 inches).
Hypersulfidic materials--The zone from 0 to 200 centimeters (Cseg horizons) have oxidized reactions with pH values less than 4 after 16 weeks.
