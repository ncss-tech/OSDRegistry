NOTCHKO SERIES

The Notchko series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from weakly consolidated fluvial, beach, dune and estuarine deposits derived from mixed sources. Notchko soils are on mountains and have slopes of 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2160 millimeters (85 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Mettah series. Mettah soils have an Udic soil moisture regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Notchko soils occur on moderately broad ridges and upper slopes of mountains. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. Elevations are 80 to 700 meters (260 to 2300 feet). The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from  weakly consolidated fluvial, beach, dune and estuarine deposits derived from mixed sources. The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters. Coastal influence limits the annual and diurnal range in temperature. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1780 to 2290 millimeters (70 to 90 inches). Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free season is 240 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Scaath, Rockysaddle, and Wiregrass soils.  Scaath and Rockysaddle soils have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.Wiregrass soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Scaath soils are 50 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) deep to a lithic contact.   The Scaath soils are on narrow spur ridges and convex slopes. The Wiregrass soils are alongside the Rockysaddle soils on colluvium of lower rock content.
  
DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; high to very high runoff; moderately slow to slow saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil has been used for commercial timber and is used for recreation, wildlife and watershed. Natural vegetation consists of Douglas-fir, redwood, tanoak, California huckleberry, Pacific madrone, Pacific rhododendron, salal, and brackenfern.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: California Coastal Redwood Belt; MLRA 4B. The series is not extensive.
