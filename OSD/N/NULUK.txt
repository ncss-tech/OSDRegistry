TYPICAL PEDON: Nuluk silt loam - on a slope of 1 percent willow/mixed grass-forb scrub. (All colors are for moist soil)

	Oi--0 to 1 inch; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) slightly decomposed plant material; many very fine and fine, common medium and common coarse roots; moderately acid (pH 5.8); abrupt smooth boundary.

       A--1 to 3 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silt loam; very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine, common medium and common coarse roots; moderately acid 9pH 5.8); clear wavy boundary.

COMPETING SERIES: There no competing series in this classification.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landforms: flood plains, flood plains on alluvial fans
Parent material: sandy and silty alluvium over sandy and gravelly alluvium
Elevation: 377 to 617 feet
Slope: 0 to 3 percent
Annual precipitation: 21 to 29 inches
Annual temperature: 23 to 25 degrees F
Frost-free period: 60 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Belmezok and Cassiterite soils. Belmezok soils are somewhat poorly drained, very deep, and occur on flood plains Cassiterite soils are somewhat poorly drained, very deep, and occur on flood plains on mountains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained, low runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the loamy part of the profile and high to very high in the sandy-skeletal part of the profile.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for military use and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is willow/mixed grass-forb scrub.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 240, Nulato Hills-Southern Seward Peninsula Highlands, Alaska. The series is of small extent.
