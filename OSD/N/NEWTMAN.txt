NEWTMAN SERIES

The Newtman series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains, stream terraces, depressions and marshes.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid Histic Humaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Newtman mucky peat, in pasture (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oe--0 to 9 inches; black (10YR 2/1) mucky peat, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; few fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) redox concentrations; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 16 inches thick)

    A--9 to 15 inches; black (10YR 2/1) silty clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 9 inches thick)

    Cg--15 to 24 inches; gray (5Y 5/1) silty clay loam, gray (5Y 6/1) dry; massive; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; 5 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 24 inches thick)

    2Cg--24 to 60 inches; dark gray (5Y 4/1) very gravelly sandy clay loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 40 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent, moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Newtman soils are used mainly for pasture and wildlife habitat.  Potential native vegetation may include tall reedgrasses, tall sedges and rushes, American sloughgrass, iris, willows, waterbirch, dogwood and silver buffaloberry as well as other grasses, sedges, forbs and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Newtman soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana. MLRA - 44B.
