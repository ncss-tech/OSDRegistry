NORMAUK SERIES

The Normauk Series consists of very deep, well drained soils on upland relict landslides. Normauk soils formed in volcanic ash and colluvium over clay from pyroclastic tuffs, basalt, rhyolite and mesozoic marine sediments. Slopes are 5 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches, mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: ashy over clayey-skeletal, glassy over smectitic, frigid Alfic Humic Vitrixerands

TYPICAL PEDON:  Normauk ashy sandy loam - upland forest, on a 10 percent slightly convex slope. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.  Textures are apparent field texture.)

        A1--2 to 7 inches, brown (10YR 5/3) ashy sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2), moist; moderate, medium platy structure; very soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine to medium roots; many very fine and fine vesicular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt smooth boundary.

        A2--7 to 15 inches, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) ashy sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine to medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine to medium roots; common very fine to medium tubular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt smooth boundary.

        A3--15 to 21 inches, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) ashy sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; strong fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, slightly firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine to coarse roots; common very fine to medium tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt smooth boundary.

        2Btb2-- 24 to 41 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) extremely cobbly sandy clay, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine to medium roots; few very fine to fine irregular and tubular pores; common distinct dark brown 10YR 3/3 (moist) clay bridging between sand grains; 25 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.4).

        2Btb3--41 to 63 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) extremely cobbly clay, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; strong very fine angular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds and rock fragments; 15 percent gravel and 60 percent cobbles, slightly acid (pH 6.4).  (Combined thickness of the 2Btb horizon is 40 to 60 inches)
