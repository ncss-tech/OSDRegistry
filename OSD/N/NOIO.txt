NOIO SERIES

The Noio series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils.  These soils formed in organic materials mixed with minor amounts of basic volcanic ash in `a`a lava.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 460 millimeters (18 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 27 degrees C. (81 degrees F.)

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Euic, isohyperthermic Typic Torrifolists

TYPICAL PEDON: Noio extremely cobbly highly decomposed plant material, on a west facing, slightly convex, 11 percent slope, under grasses, at an elevation of 113 meters (370 feet).  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.  All textures are "apparent field textures".  pH measured with organic dyes.  When described on October 5, 1999, the soil was dry throughout.) 

    2C1/Oa--0 to 10 centimeters (0 to 4 inches); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) extremely cobbly highly decomposed plant material, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) dry; strong very fine and fine granular structure; very hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial and common fine irregular pores; 25 percent `a`a gravel and 40 percent `a`a cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); the 2C part of this horizon consists of unconsolidated `a`a lava fragments of variable size.clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 10 centimeters {2 to 4 inches} thick)

    2C2--10 to 86 centimeters (4 to 34 inches); `a`a cobbles with very little soil material in voids. 

    2R--86 centimeters (34 inches); hard `a`a blue rock.

TYPE LOCATION: Island of Hawaii, Hawaii County, Hawaii; in Kealakehe, drive north past school, take the second left downslope and drive to the end of the road; walk about 960 meters (0.6 miles) west on 4WD road; pedon is 3 meters (10 feet) north of 4WD road at an elevation of 113 meters (370 feet).  Kailua Quadrangle; lat. 19 degrees 40 minutes 16.4 seconds N. and long. 155 degrees 59 minutes 57.6 seconds W. (Old Hawaiian Datum)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Depth to bedrock: 50 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches).
Mean annual soil temperature: 24 to 31 degrees C. (76 to 87 degrees F.)
Rock fragments: 65 to 85 percent by volume of the pedon and range in size from gravel to stone size lava rocks.
Organic Carbon (by weight): 25 to 30 percent of the less than 2.0 mm soil material.

2C1/Oa horizon
Value: 2 or 3 moist or dry.
Chroma: 1 or 2 moist or dry.
Structure: Weak to strong granular.
Soil reaction: Neutral or slightly alkaline (pH 6.6 to 7.8).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.  Similar soils include the Honokohau and Kaimu series.  Honokohau soils have a lithic contact and overlie pahoehoe lava at 5 to 25 centimeters (2 to 10 inches).  Kaimu soils have an ustic soil moisture regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Noio soils are on west slopes on the undissected low elevation, leeward slopes of Hualalai Volcano at elevations from sea level to 244 meters (0 to 800 feet).  These soils are on all hillslope positions of undulating to hilly `a`a flows.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 20 percent.  The soils formed mainly in organic material consisting of decomposed leaves, twigs and wood; and to a lesser degree basic volcanic ash, cinders, and weathered lava.  The mean annual rainfall ranges from 254 to 635 millimeters (10 to 25 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from April through October.  The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 2030 to 2540 millimeters (80 to 100 inches).  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 24 to 30 degrees C. (76 to 87 degrees F.)  The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C. (11 degrees F.)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Kiholo and Punaluu series and the similar Honokohau and Kaimu series.   Kiholo soils are clayey and have less than 25 percent organic carbon (by weight).  Punaluu soils are lithic and have an ustic soil moisture regime.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained.  Runoff is negligible to low.  Permeability is very rapid in the organic material and very slow in the underlying bedrock. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat.  The natural vegetation is koa haole (Leucaena leucocephala) and fountaingrass (Pennisetum setaceum).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North Kona District, Island of Hawaii; MLRA 157. The series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California.
