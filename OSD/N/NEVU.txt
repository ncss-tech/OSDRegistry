COMPETING SERIES: These are the Rojo, Sprauer, and Wellsdam  series. 

Rojo soils have 10 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have weathered rock underlying the duripan. Sprauer soils have cambic horizons; 5 to 14 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have basalt bedrock underlying the duripan. Wellsdam soils have cambic horizons; 8 to 10 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have weakly cemented duripans. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nevu soils are on moderately and strongly sloping fan remnants at elevations of 1,650 to 2,290 meters. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The soils formed in gravelly alluvium primarily from welded tuff with some limestone. The climate is cool, continental with a mean annual precipitation of 250 to 300 mm, with much of it coming as snow and as periodic summer thunderstorms. The mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C and the frost-free season is about 90 to 120 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Okayview and Sevenmile soils. Okayview soils are shallow to soft bedrock and contain 5 to 15 percent rock fragments. Sevenmile soils occur on inset fans, are very deep, and have 8 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well-drained; medium to high runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Nevu soils are used for wildlife habitat and livestock grazing. The potential native vegetation is bluebunch wheatgrass and mountain big sagebrush with a substantial invasion of singleleaf pinyon and Utah juniper. This pedon is correlated to Ecological Site R028AY050NV, Gravelly Clay 10-12 P.Z.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Nevada. Nevu soils are not extensive. MLRA 29 and 28A.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Lincoln County (Meadow Valley Area), Nevada, 1971. 

REMARKS: This soil was formerly classified as having a frigid temperature regime, but local temperature data supports a mesic soil temperature. Changed to mesic temperature in October 2002. Moved the type location and changed to ashy, glassy, Vitritorrandic in June 2005.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to  28 cm (A and Bt horizons).
Argillic horizon - The zone from 13 to 69 cm (Bt, Btk, and Btqk horizons).
Duripan (indurated) - The zone from 69 to 91 cm (Bqkm horizon).
Vitritorrandic feature - The zone from 13 to 63 cm with 30 to 50 percent volcanic glass in the 0.02 to 2 mm fraction and averages 0.02 to 0.04 percent Al plus 1/2Fe, extracted by ammonium oxalate (Bt, Btk, and upper part of the Btqk horizons).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 13 to 63 cm (Bt, Btk, and upper part of the Btqk horizons).
