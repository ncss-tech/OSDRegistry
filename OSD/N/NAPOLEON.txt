NAPOLEON SERIES

The Napoleon series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in organic materials. These soils are in bogs on till plains, outwash plains, lake plains, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Dysic, mesic Typic Haplohemists

TYPICAL PEDON: Napoleon muck, on a 1 percent slope in a wooded area. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

 Oa1--0 to 13 cm (5 inches); black (N 2.5/) muck (sapric material); about 5 percent fiber, 2 percent rubbed; moderate fine granular structure; very friable; many fine roots; herbaceous fibers; extremely acid [pH 4.0 in calcium chloride]; clear smooth boundary. 

 Oa2--13 to 25 cm (5 to 10 inches); dark brown (7.5YR 3/2), very dark brown (10YR 2/2) rubbed muck (sapric material); about 40 percent fiber, 10 percent rubbed; weak medium platy structure; very friable; many fine roots; herbaceous fibers; extremely acid [pH 4.0 in calcium chloride]; clear smooth boundary. 

 Oe1--25 to 66 cm (10 to 26 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4), very dark brown (10YR 2/2) rubbed mucky peat (hemic material); about 80 percent fiber, 25 percent rubbed; weak thick platy structure; friable; herbaceous fibers; extremely acid [pH 4.2 in calcium chloride]; gradual smooth boundary. 

 Oe2--66 to 152 cm (26 to 60 inches); dark brown (10YR 3/3), very dark brown (10YR 2/2) rubbed mucky peat (hemic material); about 60 percent fiber, 20 percent rubbed; massive; friable; herbaceous fibers; extremely acid [pH 4.4 in calcium chloride]. 

TYPE LOCATION: Jackson County, Michigan; about 4 miles west of Napoleon; 1310 feet south of the northeast corner of sec. 8, T. 4 S., R. 1 E. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Thickness of the organic layers: more than 130 cm (51 inches)
Organic material: primarily herbaceous in origin
Woody fragment content: 0 to 10 percent 
Control section: layers have a pH of less than 4.5 in calcium chloride.
Mean January soil temperature: minus 3.3 degrees C (26 degrees F)
Mean July temperature: 21.7 degrees C (71 degrees F)
Mean annual soil temperature: 8.3 to 15.0 degrees C (47 to 59 degrees F)

Some pedons have sphagnum moss up to 15 cm (6 inches) thick on the surface. 

Surface tier:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR or is neutral
Value: 2, 2.5, or 3, some peat layers have rubbed values up to 6
Chroma: 0 to 3
Organic material: muck (sapric material) to peat (fibric material) 

Subsurface and bottom tiers:
Hue: 10R to 10YR
Value: 2 to 5
Chroma: 1 to 4; these colors darken on exposure to air and rubbing 

Some pedons have layers of mineral material below 152 cm (60 inches).

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Mukilteo series. Mukilteo soils have a mean January temperature of about 0 degrees C (32 degrees F) and a mean July temperature of about 15.0 degrees C (59 degrees F). 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Napoleon soils are in bogs on till plains, outwash plains, lake plains, and moraines of Wisconsinan Age. Bogs range from small enclosed depressions to about 100 acres in size. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Napoleon soils formed in organic materials. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 610 to 1067 mm (24 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.2 to 10.0 degrees C (45 to 50 degrees F). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Boots and Houghton soils. Poorly drained and very poorly drained mineral soils are associated at the margins of bogs in some places. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. Depth to the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between September and June in normal years. The ponded phase has a seasonal high water table from 61 cm (2 feet) above the surface to 15 cm (.5 foot) below the surface throughout the year. Potential surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high. Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are primarily in woodland and pasture. Principal vegetation is red maple, silver maple, swamp white oak, poison sumac, alder, buttonbush, wild blueberry, dogwood, and Michigan holly in the native state. Pastured soils have reed canarygrass, sedges and some trees. Some of these soils are used for growing domestic blueberries. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 97, 98, 101, 111B, 142, 143, 144A in the southern part of the lower peninsula of Michigan, northern Indiana, and New York. The series is of moderate extent.
