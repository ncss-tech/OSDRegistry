NAGITSY SERIES

The Nagitsy series consists of moderately deep to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from igneous and quartzitic metamorphic rocks on mountains and foothills.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 500 mm and the average annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Pachic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Nagitsy gravelly loam -- on a south-facing slope of 40 percent, in rangeland, at 2286 meters elevation.  (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A1--0 to 18 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; strong very fine and fine granular structure (very weak thin platy in upper 2 inches); soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; 25 percent quartzite gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.3); clear smooth boundary.  (13 to 30 cm thick)

    A2--18 to 33 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to strong fine and medium granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine irregular and common very fine tubular pores; 35 percent angular quartzite gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 33 cm thick)

    AB--33 to 58 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) and brown (7.5YR 5/3) gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) and dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak very fine and fine subangular blocky; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; many very fine tubular pores; 35 percent angular quartzite gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 30 cm thick)

    Bw--58 to 86 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/3) and brown (10YR 5/3) crushed; very gravelly heavy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; many very fine tubular pores; 50 percent angular quartzite gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt irregular boundary.  (10 to 41 cm thick)

    R--86 cm; white (5YR 8/1) and white (10YR 8/1) fractured and slightly weathered quartzite bedrock, stained inward 1 mm and in cracks with light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) and little reddish yellow (5YR 6/6); slightly acid (pH 6.2).

TYPE LOCATION:  Bannock County, Idaho; NW 1/4 NW 1/4 of  section 33, T.5 S., R.37 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Average annual soil temperature - 2 to 6 degrees C.
Average summer soil temperature - 12 to 15 degrees C.

Reaction (pH) - moderately acid through neutral.

O horizons - if present are discontinuous.

A horizon
Value - 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma - 2 or 3 dry or moist.

Bw horizon

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Behanin, Belsac, Blanca, Busterback (T), Caballo, Compone, Croesus, Darland, Dateman, Gateview, Hapgood, Harcany, Hobacker, Lionhead (T), Lolon, Marcetta, Namela, Nazaton, Nevtah, Poleline, Povey, Prong, Snag, Spearhead, and Splitbutte (T) series.  The Behanin, Blanca, Busterback, Caballo, Compone, Darland, Gateview, Hapgood, Harcany, Hobacker, Lionhead, Lolon, Marcetta, Nazaton, Poleline, Povey, Snag, and Spearhead soils lack bedrock above 40 inches.  Belsac soils have secondary lime and lack cambic horizons.  Croesus, Prong, and Splitbutte soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Dateman soils have clay films in the cambic horizon and in fractures of the bedrock and have continuous "O" horizons.  Namela soils have channers and angular cobbles, and are not continually dry for 60 days following the summer solstice.  Nevtah soils lack cambic horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nagitsy soils are on mountains and foothills at elevation of 1220 to 2895 meters.  Slopes range from 0 to 70 percent.  The soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from quartzitic, argillaceous or acid igneous rocks.  The subhumid climate has an average annual
precipitation of 340 to 640 millimeters including 1525 to 3050 mm of snowfall, and an average annual temperature of 1 to 6 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 25 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Moohoo, Nielsen, and Tahquats soils.  Moohoo soils have a base saturation below 50 percent and a C:N ratio above 13.5 in the upper 15 cm of the umbric epipedon.   Nielsen and Tahquats soils have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to very rapid
runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Nagitsy soils are used mainly for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The dominant natural vegetation is bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, big sagebrush, snowberry, junegrass, chokecherry, and snowbrush ceanothus.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mountains of southern Idaho, Utah, and Colorado.  This series is moderately extensive.
