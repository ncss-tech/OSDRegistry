NAMMOTH SERIES

The Nammoth series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and colluvium or residuum from welded tuff, rhyolite or basalt.  They are on foothills, buttes, and basalt plains.  Permeability is slow.  Slopes range from 1 to 35 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, mesic Aridic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Nammoth extremely bouldery loam -- on a west-facing slope of 20 percent, in rangeland, at 4,300 feet elevation.  (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.  When described on May 20, 1991, the soil was moist throughout.)

(3 to 8 inches thick)

    Bt1--8 to 13 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely bouldery clay loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; few very fine, fine, medium and coarse tubular pores; many faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 20 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones and 25 percent boulders; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual wavy  boundary.  (3 to 11 inches thick)

    Bt2--13 to 23 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely bouldery clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; few very fine, fine, medium and coarse tubular pores; many faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 15 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, 20 percent stones and 25 percent boulders; slightly acid (pH 6.3); abrupt irregular boundary.  (4 to 12 inches thick)

    R--23 inches; fractured unweathered rhyolite.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cassiro, Cochran (T), Eglirim, Fivesprings (T), Hyall, Pickup and Ruclick series. Cassiro, Cochran, Eglirim, and Hyall soils lack lithic contacts above 40 inches.  Fivesprings soils are neutral or mildly alkaline in the argillic horizon and the rock fragments in the particle-size control section are dominantly gravel.  Pickup soils have a subhorizon of the argillic with greater than 50 percent clay and they are neutral to moderately alkaline in the argillic horizon. Ruclick soils are neutral to moderately alkaline in the argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nammoth soils are on foothills, buttes, and basalt plains at elevations of 4,200 to 5,000 feet.  Slopes range from 1 to 35 percent. These soils formed in loess and colluvium or residuum from welded tuff, rhyolite or basalt. The climate is cool and moist in the winter and hot and dry in the summer. Average annual precipitation ranges from 11 to 13 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 45 to 48 degrees F. The frost-free period is 85 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Quiero and Ruckles series. Quiero soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section and are on similar landscape positions. Ruckles soils are lithic and are on ridges.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very slow to very rapid runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Nammoth soils are used mainly for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The potential native vegetation is foothill sagebrush, bitterbrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Thurber's needlegrass and Sandberg bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southcentral Idaho.  Nammoth soils are of small extent.
