NEIBERGER SERIES

The Neiberger series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits over residuum derived from shale.  Neiberger soils are on summits, shoulders, sideslopes and footslopes of hills.  Slopes range from 3 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Calciargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Neiberger loam, on a northwest facing, summit, 6 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 4880 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cataract, Chattin, Mack, Mesa, and Nannyton series.   Chattin, Mack, Mesa, and Nannyton soils are very deep.  Cataract soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact with hard sandstone and have hues redder than 7.5YR.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  Eolian deposits over residuum derived from shale
Landform:  Summits, shoulders, sideslopes, and footslopes of hills
Slopes:  3 to 25 percent
Elevation:  4500 to 5000 feet
Mean annual temperature:  50 to 54 degrees F

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Killpack, Kompace, and Norkiki series.  The Killpack soils lack a calcic horizon and are on the steeper sideslopes.  The Kompace soils are shallow to a petrocalcic horizon.  The Norkiki soils lack a calcic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, medium to rapid runoff, moderately slow and slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major uses are rangeland, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  The native vegetation consists of needleandthread, Indian ricegrass, galleta, and shadscale.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  West Central, Colorado; LRR D, MLRA 34; This series is of small extent.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 5 to 20 inches.  (Bt and Btk horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 5 inches.  (A1 and A2 horizons)
Argillic horizon:  The zone from 5 to 20 inches.  (Bt and Btk horizons)
Calcic horizon:  The zone from 12 to 24 inches.  (Btk and Bk horizons)
Paralithic contact:  The contact with shale at 30 inches.  (Cr layer)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
