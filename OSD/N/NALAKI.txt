NALAKI SERIES  

The Nalaki series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in pyroclastics.  Nalaki soils are on fan terraces surrounding and extending from cinder cones and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Cindery, mixed, mesic Argiduridic Durustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Nalaki gravelly loam, rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  About 50 percent of the surface is covered with cinder gravel that is mostly 2 mm to 1/4 inch in diameter.  

    A1--0 to 3 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown  (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate, medium platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; many very fine and fine vesicular and interstitial pores; 40 percent 2 mm to 1/4 inch size cinders; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick)  

    A2--3 to 10 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few fine tubular and interstitial pores; 30 percent 2 mm to 1/4 inch size cinders; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)  

    Bw1--10 to 14 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky parting to weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many fine tubular and interstitial pores; 60 to 70 percent lime coated cinders 2 mm to 1/4 inch in size; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 14 inches thick)  

    Bw2--14 to 21 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many fine tubular and interstitial pores; 60 to 70 percent lime coated cinders 2 mm to 1/4 inch in size; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 10 inches thick)  

    Bqkm--21 to 27 inches; pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) silica-lime cemented pan, pink (7.5YR 7/4) moist; massive with thin laminar surface and having pendants on the lower surface; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick)  

    C--27 to 80 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) cinders, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; single grained; loose, with lime coatings on some of the cinders.  

TYPE LOCATION:  Coconino County, Arizona; 1,000 feet east and 1,500 feet south of the NW corner of sec. 35, T.26N., R.7E.; about 28 miles north of Flagstaff.

Air temperature:  48 to 56 degrees F. 

Depth to duripan:  20 to 40 inches  

Depth to cinders:  30 to 40 inches 

Rock fragments:  35 to 70 percent cinder pebbles

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nalaki soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping fan terraces surrounding and extending from cinder cones at elevations of 4,800 to 5,900 feet.  They formed in pyroclastics.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Average annual precipitation is 8 to 14 inches.  The average annual temperature is 52 to 55 degrees F. The frost-free season ranges from 150 to 170 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Aut, Tuweep (P) and Winona soils and the competing Lomaki (P) and Wukoki (P) soils. Aut, Tuweep and Winona soils lack duripans.  In addition, Aut soils are moderately deep to bedrock; Tuweep soils are fine-loamy, and Winona soils have limestone bedrock at shallow depths.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderately permeable.  

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mostly for grazing by livestock and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation consists of black grama, blue grama, galleta, winterfat, needlegrass, rabbitbrush and fourwing saltbush.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North central Arizona; moderately extensive. MLRAs 35 & 39.
