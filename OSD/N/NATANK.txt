NATANK SERIES 

The Natank series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and residuum from sedimentary rocks. Natank soils are on plateaus and mesas and have slopes of 1 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches (406 mm) and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F (11.1 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Calcidic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Natank extremely gravelly loam - woodland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

TYPE LOCATION: Coconino County, Arizona; on the Hualapai Indian Reservation; 2100 feet west and 800 feet south of the northeast corner of section 12, T. 29 N., R. 7 W. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: Dry in some part for 90 or more days cumulative and is moist in some part for 45 consecutive days during June through October and more than half the time that the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F (5 degrees C). The soil is driest during May and June. Aridic ustic soil moisture regime.

Soil temperature: 49 to 56 degrees F (9.4 to 13.3 degrees C). 

Rock fragments: averages less than 15 percent in the particle size control section. The surface layer can ranges up to 70 percent. 

Depth to bedrock: 20 to 40 inches (51 to 102 cm), but more commonly 26 to 38 inches (66 to 97 cm)

Reaction: neutral in the upper part to moderately alkaline in the lower part 

Depth to calcic horizon: 14 to 40 inches (36 to 102 cm)

Calcium carbonate equivalent: Averages 15 to 40 percent in the calcic horizon 

A horizon 
Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR 
Value: 3 or 5 dry, 3 to 5 moist

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Boxcanyon (CO) series. Boxcanyon soils are deep.and reside in LRR-G which has different climate and timing of precipitation.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Natank soils are on plateaus and mesas at elevations of 5800 to 6600 feet (1768 to 2012 meters). They formed in alluvium from sandstone and limestone. Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 18 inches (330 to 457 mm). The mean annual air temperature is about 47 to 54 degrees F (8.3 to12.2 degrees C). The frost-free period is 120 to 160 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Disterheff, Toqui, and Yumtheska soils. Disterheff soils are Vertic and are on fan terraces, the Toqui and Yumtheska soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 20 inches. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; slow or very slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Natank soils are used for fuelwood production and grazeable woodland. Present vegetation is muttongrass, blue grama, Utah juniper, pinyon pine and Stansbury cliffrose. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern and north central Arizona. This series is extensive. MLRA 35.
