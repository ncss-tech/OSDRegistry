NAZATON SERIES

The Nazaton series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and material weathered from granitic rocks. They are on backslopes of mountains and canyons. Permeability is moderately rapid. Slopes are 20 to 90 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 26 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Baconcamp, Beehunt, Benhanco, Behanin, Belsac (T), Bullrey, Busterback, Caballo, Croesus, Dressel, Gateview, Hapgood, Harcany, Hobacker, Lionhead (T), Lolon, Marcetta, Nagitsy, Namela, Nevtah, Papaspila, Parkcity, Poleline, Povey, Snag, Snopoc, Splitbutte, Tonigut, and Warshod series. Baconcamp and Splitbutte soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact. Beehunt, Busterback, soils have a xeric moisture regime. Behanco and Dressel soils have an albic horizon. Behanin and Marcetta soils have an E horizon. Belsac, Croesus, Namela, Nevtah, and Nagitsy soils are less than 40 inches deep to bedrock. Belsac, Gateview, Hapgood, Harcany, and Lolon soils lack Bw horizons. Belsac, Caballo, Hobacker, Lionhead, and Mundos soils have secondary carbonates. Bullrey, Poleline, and Povey soils lack an O horizon.  Papaspila soils have more than 35 percent andesite, diorite, rhyolite, tuff, basalt, and breccia fragments in the particle-size control section. Parkcity soils have more than 35 percent limestone, quartzite and sandstone fragments in the particle-size control section. Snag soils have a pH of 5.5 to 6.2 throughout and have a summer soil temperature of 60 to 62 degrees F. Snopoc soils are dominated by coarse sand fraction in the textural control section and have 60 to 80 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the control section. Tonigut soils have identifiable secondary carbonates in the lower part of the particle-size control  section and a paralithic contact within 60 inches of the mineral soil surface. Warshod soils have a xeric moisture regime and a paralithic contact within 60 inches of the mineral soil surface. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nazaton soils are dominately on north-facing slopes of canyons and mountains with slopes of 20 to 90 percent. They formed in loess mixed with colluvium and residuum from granitic rocks. Elevations are 2,400 to 7,600 feet. The average annual precipitation is 24 to 30 inches. The average January temperature is about 16 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 60 degrees F. The average annual temperature is about 38 to 44 degrees F. The frost-free season is 45 to 100 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brower, Olan, Spokel, Naz, and Suttler soils. Brower, Olan, and Spokel soils have an average annual temperature above 47 degrees F. Suttler soils lack mollic epipedons and are coarse-loamy. Naz soils lack more than 35 percent rock fragments in the 10 to 40 inch section. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; rapid or very rapid runoff; moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for production of timber, grazeable woodland, and wildlife habitat. Natural vegetation is mainly Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, snowberry, brome grass, and low Oregon-grape. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central and southwestern Idaho. This series is of small extent.
