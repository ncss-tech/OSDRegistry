NOXVILLE SERIES

The Noxville series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in residuum derived from limestone. These gently sloping soils occur on interfluves of ridges on dissected plateaus. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 17.8 degrees C (64 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, smectitic, thermic, shallow Petrocalcic Paleustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Noxville clay, 2 percent slope in rangeland; elevation is 680 m (2231 ft) (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Kerr County, Texas, 2017, Kerr County soil survey area, Texas, 2017. The name is from an USGS topographic quadrangle name Old Noxville, Texas.

REMARKS: The series was formerly included in the Purves series. The series was separated based on the presence of a petrocalcic horizon.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle size control section: 0 to 31 cm (0 to 12 in) (A and Bw horizons)
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 31 cm (0 to 12 in). (A and Bw horizons) 
Petrocalcic horizon: 31 to 100 cm (12 to 40 in). (Bkkm horizon)
