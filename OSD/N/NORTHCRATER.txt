NORTHCRATER SERIES

The Northcrater series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in volcanic tephra. Northcrater soils are on cinder cones, and have slopes of 2 to 25 percent. The permeability is very rapid. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-skeletal, glassy, nonacid, frigid Vitrandic Xerorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Northcrater gravelly loamy sand - on a 2 percent slope at an elevation of 5,600 feet in rangeland. When described on June 17, 1997, the soil was dry. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

	A1--0 to 4 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) very gravelly ashy loamy sand, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak fine granular structure; loose; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; about 40 percent gravel size cinders; neutral (pH 7.3); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 6 inches thick)

	A2--4 to 8 inches; very dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/2) very gravelly ashy loamy sand, black (10YR 2/1) moist; single grained; loose; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine to medium interstitial pores; about 50 percent gravel size cinders; neutral (pH 7.3); clear smooth. (3 to 6 inches thick)

	C1--8 to 12 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) extremely ashy gravelly loamy sand, black (10YR 2/1) moist; single grained; loose; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine to medium interstitial pores; about 65 percent gravel size cinders; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 8 inches thick)

	C2--12 to 20 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) very gravelly ashy loamy sand, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; single grained; loose; few very fine roots; common very fine to medium interstitial pores; about 45 percent gravel size cinders; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 12 inches thick)

	C3--20 to 30 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) very gravelly ashy loamy sand, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; single grained; loose; few very fine roots; common very fine to medium interstitial pores; about 50 percent gravel size cinders; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 15 inches thick)

	C4--30 to 60 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) very gravelly ashy loamy sand, black (10YR 2/1) moist; single grained; loose; common very fine to medium interstitial pores; about 55 percent gravel size cinders; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Northcrater soils are on recent cinder cones and associated with nonvegative cinder land. Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,400 to 6,500 feet. The soil formed in wind deposited volcanic tephra. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches, most of which falls as snow and early spring rain. The mean annual air temperature is about 40 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is 60 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Echocrater and Silentcone soils and cinderland.  Echocrater and Silentcone soils are sandy loam or loam textures and have andic soil properties.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Excessively drained. Very slow runoff. Very rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used for wildlife and limited rangeland. Vegetation is dwarf buckwheat and monkey flower with widely spaced individual plants.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Idaho. This series is moderately extensive.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

The material is to young for andic soil properties to develop.
The soil contains over 35 percent cinders throughout the profile (Vitrandic)
