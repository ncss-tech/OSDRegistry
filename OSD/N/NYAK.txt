NYAK SERIES

The Nyak series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks over lacustrine sediments.  The Nyak soils are on lake plains, beach plains and alluvial flats.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Beryl, Blimo, Bubus, Coldent, Linco, Okan and Valmy series.  

Beryl and Bubus soils are slightly through strongly saline-alkaline.  Blimo soils have continuous weakly cemented subhorizons. Coldent soils have 4 to 10 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Linco soils are 10 to 20 cm to duric horizons and have 20 to 35 percent rock fragments. Okan soils have sandy or sandy-skeletal horizons within 100 cm. Valmy lacks gypsum crystals.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nyak soils are on lake plains, beach plains and alluvial flats.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium over lacustrine sediments. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations are 1,830 to 2,020 meters.  The climate is cool, semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C.; and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Heist and Uwell series.  Heist soils lack cementation. Uwell soils are fine-loamy and lack cementation.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; slow runoff;   moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East Central Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28B.
