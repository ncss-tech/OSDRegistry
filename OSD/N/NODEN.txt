NODEN SERIES

The Noden series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium over residuum weathered from fine-grained sandstone and occasionally in slide deposits. They occur on dissected fan aprons, terraces, pediments, and rotational slides. Slopes are 0 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Noden fine sandy loam-rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 13 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium and fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 18 cm thick)

    BA--13 to 23 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots; neutral (pH 7.3); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 15 cm thick) 

    Bt--23 to 41 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong medium and fine prismatic structure parting to strong medium and fine subangular blocky; very hard, firm, sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots along ped faces; many prominent clay films on faces of peds; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 42 cm thick)

    BC--41 to 51 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); gradual wavy boundary. (8 to 25 cm thick)

    C--51 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).
