NUECES SERIES

The Nueces series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately slow permeable soils that formed in sandy eolian deposits over loamy Quaternary age alluvium.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on the Sandsheet Prairie of the South Texas Coastal Plain.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm (25 in).

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mostly for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Vegetation is grasses such as seacoast bluestem, fringeleaf paspalum, switchgrass, threeawn, grassbur,and fall witchgrass. Invading vegetation such as scattered mesquite, pricklypear, and catclaw are common. A few areas of this soil are used for crop and forage production. Cotton, vegetables, and watermelons are the principal crops. The ecological site is Sandy 25-35 PZ (R083EY706TX).
