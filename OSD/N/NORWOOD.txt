DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mainly along the lower Brazos and Colorado River systems and their tributaries.  The series is extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED: McLennan County, Texas, 1947.

REMARKS: Classification change from Typic Udifluvents to Fluventic Eutrudepts (1998) based on recognition that the majority of pedons have a weak cambic horizon as evidenced by removal of carbonates, slight color change in the Bw horizon, and landscape position conducive to the development of a cambic horizon.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon:0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in). (Ap horizons)
Cambic horizon: 25 to 46 cm (10 to 18 in). (Bw horizon)
Calcic horizon: 46 to 71 cm (18 to 28 in). (Bk horizon)
Fluventic feature: bedding planes and irregular organic carbon distribution

ADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL data from the type location in Colorado County, TX (S93TX-089-001).  Data for THD from Brazoria County, Texas (S76TX039-008).
