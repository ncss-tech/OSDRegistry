NOSKI SERIES

The Noski series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from fanglomerate, consisting of limestone, dolomite, and minor amounts of quartzite. Noski soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 4 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 450 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, frigid Lithic Calcixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Noski gravelly loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is partially covered with approximately 50 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones. The biological crust cover consists of 2 percent cyanobacteria, 2 percent lichens, and 1 percent moss

(10 to 20 cm thick)

    Bk2--28 to 38 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) extremely gravelly sandy loam, light gray (10YR 7/2) moist; strong thick platy structure; very hard, extremely firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine, and few fine interstitial pores; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; many prominent (30 percent) secondary calcium carbonate concretions around rock fragments and common prominent (10 percent) secondary calcium carbonate concretions on bottom of rock fragments forming 2 mm pendants; 52 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 60 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5).  (8 to 20 cm thick)

    R--38 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) indurated fanglomerate, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist.

TYPE LOCATION: White Pine County, Nevada; in the Snake Range, BLM Ely District, about 1.5 mile east of Big Spring Wash and 0.3 miles east of a jeep trail, which is now in the Highland Ridge Wilderness Area; USGS Big Spring 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 44 minutes 45 seconds N and longitude 114 degrees 13 minutes 34 seconds W; UTM zone 11, 0741073e, 4292233n, NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture - Usually moist in winter, spring, and early summer, dry in all parts at least 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice (July and August), but intermittently moist in the upper part for 10 to 20 days cumulative due to convection storms between July and September; Xeric soil moisture regime bordering aridic.
Mean annual soil temperature - 5.5 to 7 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness - 18 to 30 cm.
Depth to lithic contact - 36 to 50 cm.
Depth to calcic horizon - 18 to 30 cm.
Thickness of the calcic horizon - 15 to 32 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 12 to 18 percent.
Rock fragments: Averages 50 to 75 percent mainly gravel. Lithology of the fragments is mainly limestone.

A and ABk horizons - Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist. 
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.
Organic matter content: 2 to 3 percent.
Structure: Granular or subangular blocky.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 15 to 30 percent.
Effervescence: Strongly effervescent or violently effervescent.
Reaction: Slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.

Bk horizons - Value: 5 through 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist.
Chroma: 2 through 4, dry and moist.
Texture: Sandy loam or fine sandy loam. 
Clay content: 12 to 18 percent.
Rock fragments: 50 to 75 percent, mainly as gravel.
Structure: Weak to moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky or platy in the Bk2.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 40 to 60 percent, in the fine earth.
Secondary calcium carbonates: Common to many (10 to 40 percent) secondary calcium carbonate concretions around and on the bottom of rock fragments, increasing with depth.
Reaction: Moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Amene, Lundy, Monarch, and Streuling series.

Amene soils contain 20 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Lundy soils have rock fragments that are mainly limestone flagstones, channers or cobbles.
Monarch soils have a calcium carbonate equivalent of 5 to 15 in the A horizons and the mollic epipedon includes all or part of the Bk horizon.
Streuling soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Noski soils are on fan remnants, generally occurring on south- and west-facing aspects. 
These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from fanglomerate, consisting of limestone, dolomite, and minor amounts of quartzite. 
Slopes are 4 to 75 percent. 
Elevations range from 1,950 to 2,560 meters. 
The climate is dry-subhumid, cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. 
The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 500 mm.
The mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C.
The frost-free period is 40 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bigwash, Canyonfork, and Cedarcabin soils. 
Bigwash, and Canyonfork soils are very deep.
Cedarcabin soils are moderately deep to indurated fanglomerate.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately rapid permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Noski soils are used for recreation, livestock grazing, and wildlife habitat. The potential native vegetation is mainly scattered singleleaf pinyon and Utah juniper with bluebunch wheatgrass, Indian ricegrass, and black sagebrush. This pedon is correlated to Ecological Site R028AY0102NV, Shallow Calcareous Hill 10-14" P.Z. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28A.
