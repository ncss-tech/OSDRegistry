NEWCOMB SERIES

The Newcomb series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in glacial drift, derived mainly from granite and schist.  Newcomb soils are on mountain slopes, alluvial fans, and old high terraces and have slopes of 0 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 36 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed Lamellic Haplocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Newcomb gravelly sandy loam, forest land.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; slightly decomposed organic material, mostly needles and twigs.

    E--2 to 14 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) gravelly sandy loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; weak medium granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 30 percent gravel; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary.   (9 to 19 inches thick)

    E and Bt1--14 to 24 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly loamy sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; 5 percent light brown (7.5YR 6/4) sandy loam and clay loam lamellae 0.5 to 1.0 cm thick; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 40 percent gravel; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 15 inches thick)

    E and Bt2--24 to 36 inches; 80 percent light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly loamy sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist and 20 percent light brown (7.5YR 6/4) sandy clay loam lamellae 0.5 to 1.5 cm thick; light sandy loam texture after mixing; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 50 percent gravel; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 16 inches thick)

    E and Bt3--36 to 48 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly loamy sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; 5 percent light brown (7.5YR 6/4) sandy loam and sandy clay loam lamellae 0.5 to 1.0 cm thick; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 50 percent gravel; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 20 inches thick)

    C--48 to 62 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very gravelly sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; single grain; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 60 percent gravel; slightly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Grand County, Colorado; about 12 miles south of Parshall; approximately 2,000 feet south and 500 feet west of the NE corner of Sec. 11, T. 2 S., R. 78 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: (Depths given are measured from the mineral soil surface)
Soil moisture regime: udic
Mean annual soil temperature: about 34 degrees F.
Mean summer soil temperature: about 45 degrees F.
Base saturation: 30 to 70 percent, greater than 60 percent in some subhorizon above 30 inches

Particle-size control section:
Rock fragment content: 35 to 80 percent, dominantly gravel and cobble

A horizon (present in some pedons)
Hue: 7.5YR to 5Y
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 1 through 3
Reaction: moderately acid to neutral.

E horizon
Hue: 7.5YR to 5Y
Value: 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist
Chroma: 1 through 6
Texture (fine earth fraction): sandy loam or loam

Value: 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist
Chroma: 1 through 6
Total thickness of lamellae: 4 to 6 inches
Reaction: moderately acid to neutral.

C horizon

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.  When reclassified, the Meadowlake and Ohman series may be competing. Meadowlake soils have a lithic contact within 40 inches.  Ohman soils have a paralithic contact within 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on mountain slopes, alluvial fans, and old high terraces.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 75 percent.  These soils formed in glacial drift, derived mainly from granite and schist.  Much of these materials has been moved by gravitational forces since deposition.  Some areas have a thin capping of eolian sediments or finer textured wash.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring during the winter and spring, and is in the form of snow.  The average annual temperature is 36 degrees F., and the average summer temperature is about 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is generally less than 50 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Leighcan, Upson, Grenadier, and Frisco soils.  Leighcan and Grenadier soils have low base saturation and a loamy-skeletal control section.  Upson soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Frisco soils have an argillic horizon and a loamy-skeletal control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; slow runoff; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for forestry and for recreation.  Principal vegetation is lodgepole pine, and a sparse understory of grasses and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  High mountains of north central Colorado.  LRR E, MLRA 48A.  The series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Jackson County, Colorado, 1973.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon: from 2 to 14 inches (E horizon)
Cambic horizon: from 2 to 14 inches (E horizon)
Particle-size control section: The zone from 12 to 42 inches (part of the E, the E and Bt1, E and Bt2, and part of the E and Bt3 horizon)

Keys to Soil Taxonomy:  Series classified according to Eighth Edition, 1998.

The base saturation status needs further study.  The mineralogy family is being evaluated and may be paramicaceous.
