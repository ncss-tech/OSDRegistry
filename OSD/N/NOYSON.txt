NOYSON SERIES

The Noyson series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from rhyolite, andesite, and some granite.  Noyson soils are on fan piedmonts and fan skirts.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Cambidic Haplodurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Noyson sand--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise indicated.)

   A1--0 to 5 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; single grain, loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine interstitial pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 10 cm thick)

   A2--5 to 15 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many fine vesicular pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (3 to 15 cm thick)

   Bk--15 to 25 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak very thin platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; common soft carbonate masses; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to 30 cm thick)

   Bqk1--25 to 53 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) discontinuous weakly cemented sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; few fine distinct black (10YR 2/1) manganese mottles, and white (10YR 8/1) and brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) carbonate and silica coating underside of plates; moderate thin platy structure; hard, firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, and few medium roots matting between plates; few very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (13 to 38 cm thick)

   Bqk2--53 to 79 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) stratified gravelly coarse sandy loam, gravelly loamy sand and gravelly sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine tubular pores; 25 percent gravel; matrix is noneffervescent but is violently effervescent in horizontal seams and coating underside of gravel; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to 50 cm thick)

   Bqkm--79 to 117 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) strongly cemented lenticular duripan 2 to 5 mm thick, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; white (10YR 8/1) carbonate coating underside of pan fragments; massive; hard and very hard, firm and extremely firm; root mats on pan faces; violently effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  Nye County, Nevada; 100 feet south of the N 1/4 corner of section 18, T. 7 N., R. 40 E.; USGS Rainier Mountain 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 28 minutes 30 seconds N and longitude 117 degrees 31 minutes 33 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.4750000  latitude, -117.5258333 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in some part for short periods during winter and early spring months and for l0 to 20 days cumulative between July and October due to convection storms; typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 15 degrees C.
Depth to Bqk horizon: 15 to 46 cm.
Depth to duripan: 50 to 40 cm.
Carbonates:  Noneffervescent through violently effervescent depending on stratification.

Particle-size control section - Clay content 5 to l5 percent.  
Rock fragments:  Averages less than 30 percent gravel but may be very gravelly in any one horizon.

A horizon
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Structure:  Single grained, platy or massive.
Carbonates:  Noneffervescent through strongly effervescent.
Reaction:  Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

Bk & Bqk horizons
Value:  3 through 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Texture: Stratified sand, loamy sand, and sandy loam. Averages sandy loam.
Structure:  Massive or platy.
Reaction:  Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.
Carbonates:  Strongly effervescent or violently effervescent.

Bqkm horizon
Value:  6 through 8 dry; 4 through 6 moist.
Chroma:  l through 3.
Rock fragments:  Up to 30 percent gravel in some pedons.
Consistence:  Extremely firm or very firm in one or more horizons.
Reaction:  Strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Blacka series.  Blacka soils lack Bk and Bqk horizons above the duripan and have a cambic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Noyson soils are on fans piedmonts and fan skirts.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium derived primarily from rhyolite, andesite, basalt and tuff.  Elevations are 1,470 to 1,680 meters.  The climate is warm arid with a mean annual precipitation of 100 to 150 mm.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C.  The average frost-free season is l30 to l50 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dobel and Izo soils.  Dobel soils have an argillic horizon and a duripan within a depth of 50 cm. Izo soils have a sandy-skeletal particle-size control section.  

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is principally Bailey greasewood, shadscale, bud sagebrush and Anderson wolfberry with some Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Nevada.  These soils are of small extent, MLRA 29.
