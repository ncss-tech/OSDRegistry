NINEPOINT SERIES

The Ninepoint series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable calcareous soils. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on alluvial flats. They developed in silty, calcareous alluvium predominantly from limestone and mudstone. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 70 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, hyperthermic Ustic Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON: Ninepoint clay loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ninepoint soils are on broad, nearly level alluvial flats in a semi-bolson landscape.  They formed in fine-silty alluvium of Holocene age, derived mainly from Cretaceous limestone and mudstone.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent, mostly less than 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 68 to 72 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches, and occurs as high intensity rainfall during convectional afternoon thunderstorms from June through September. Frost-free period is 240 to 280 days.  Elevation is 1,800 to 3,500 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Blackgap (TX) and Vieja (TX) series. Blackgap soils are less than 20 inches to limestone bedrock and occur on surrounding hills and mountains. Vieja soils are less than 20 inches to densic shale and are on low hills.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderate. Runoff is negligible on slopes less than 1 percent, and very low on 1 to 2 percent slopes. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for livestock grazing. Vegetation physiognomy is desert shrubland. Dominant woody plants are creosotebush, western honey mesquite, tarbush, whitebrush, wolfberry, allthorn, and pitaya.  Grasses include tobosa, burrograss, plains bristlegrass, blue panic, and annuals.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Big Bend region of Trans-Pecos Texas; LRR D, MLRA 42, Southern Desertic Basins, Plains, and Mountains, Hot Desert Shrub LRU. The series is moderately extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Big Bend National Park ,Brewster County, Texas, 2010. The name is from a drainageway near the type location.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 4 inches (A horizon)

Cambic horizon - the zone from 4 to 80 inches (Bw1, Bw2, Bw3, Bw4, and Bw5 horizons)

These soils were previously included in the Tornillo and Mimbres series.
