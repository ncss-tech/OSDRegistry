GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ironcreek, Rocklake, and Taral
soils.
Ironcreek soils are well drained, lack a mollic epipedon, texture, and occur in river valleys and flood plains
Rocklake soils are shallow to bedrock, and typically occur on ridge lines and escarpments. 
Taral soils are well drained, have deep (>40 cm, 16 in thick) mollic epipedons, and occur on mountain and hill slopes greater than 25 percent.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class: well drained
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: very high in the Oi horizon, moderately high in the A, B and C horizons.
Permeability: very rapid in the Oi horizon, moderate in the A, B and C horizons.
Runoff: high

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Use: wildlife habitat, recreation, and subsistence
