NALA SERIES

The Nala series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from mixed sources. Nala soils are on footslopes on interfluves of undulating plains. Slopes are 3 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Nala gravelly sandy loam--on a footslope of an undulating plain sloping 12 percent to the south at 6,636 feet elevation--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. When described on September 12, 2002, the soil was moist 0 to 2 inches and otherwise dry throughout.)

(Combined thickness of the Bk horizons is 35 to 50 inches)

    2Ck--49 to 82 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely gravelly coarse sand, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; 80 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent, secondary calcium carbonate segregated as common fine concretions; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

COMPETING SERIES: Current competitors are the Abracon, ThumbRock, Chroder, Chugcity, Chupadera, Cobbra, Harvey, Milok, Mivida, Sazi and Yattle. 

Abracon, Chroder, Cobbra, Harvey, Milok, Mivida and Yattle soils have less than 15% rock fragments in the particle size control section.  In addition, Chroder and Yattle soils are more moist during spring months. 
ThumbRock, Chugcity, Chupadera, and Sazi soils are moderately deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nala soils are on footslopes on interfluves of undulating plains. They formed in slope alluvium derived from mixed sources. Slopes are 3 to 15 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,200 to 7,200 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Arojomil, Pastura, and Tapia soils.  Arojomil soils are fine-loamy, have petrocalcic and argillic horizons, and are on summits and shoulders of undulating plains.  Pastura soils are loamy, have petrocalcic horizons, and are on shoulders and beveled summits.  Tapia soils are fine-silty, have an argillic horizon, and are on summits.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; runoff is low; permeability is moderately rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION: Nala soils are used for livestock grazing and farming. Present vegetation is blue grama, sand dropseed, and winterfat.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Nala soils are of small extent in the northern part of the Estancia Basin in the Mexican Highland section of the Basin and Range physiographic province in northcentral New Mexico, MLRA 70C.
