DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class--Subaqueous
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--High or Very High
Soil moisture regime--Peraquic
Soil is continuously inundated with salt or brackish water.
The potential for submarine fresh ground water discharge zones are high given the geomorphic position and high through very high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major uses--These soils are used for recreation and aquatic habitat. Shellfish cultivation, which includes lobsters, hard-clams, and oysters, is very important in these soils. In addition, fishing is commonplace, and the species found in the area include smelt, small cod, flounder, scup, menhaden, and white perch.
Native vegetation--Some areas are vegetated with native floating algae and rooted vegetation such as eelgrass (Zostera marina). Rooted green algae (Codium) also occurs on Napatree soils.  Vegetative cover ranges from 0 through 15 percent.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
General area--These soils are located along Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island coasts.
Land Resource Regions--R - Northeastern Forage and Forest Region and S - Northern Atlantic Slope Diversified Farming Region
MLRA(s)--144A, 145, and 149B
Extent--Small
