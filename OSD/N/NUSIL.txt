GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: loamy alluvium of Quaternary age

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the competing Leming soils and the Rhymes, Papalote, Poth, and Wilco soils. 
Leming and Poth soils are on slightly higher positions and have a clayey particle-size control section. 
Papalote and Wilco soils are on slightly higher positions, have a clayey particle-size control section, and have sandy surfaces less then 51 cm (20 in) thick. 
Rhymes soils are on similar to slightly higher positions and have sandy surface horizons more than 102 cm (40 in) thick. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: The soil is somewhat excessively drained in the A and E horizons and moderately well drained in Bt horizons. Runoff is negligible on slopes of less than 1 percent, low on 1 to 5 percent slopes. Permeability is rapid in the fine sand A and E horizons, moderately rapid in the loamy fine sand A and E horizons, slow in the upper part of the Bt horizon and moderately slow in the lower part of the Bt horizon. A perched water table is at the contact of the Bt horizon is some years. After heavy rainfalls during the winter and spring months the water table is usually less than 15 cm (6 in) thick and persists for very brief or brief periods. A water table more than 13 cm (5 in) thick exists for less than 1 week. 

USE AND VEGETATION: The soil is used mainly for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. A few areas are used for crop production and forage production. The most common crops grown are peanuts, watermelons or vegetables. Native vegetation consist of grasses such as little bluestem, brownseed paspalum, Indiangrass, switchgrass, tanglehead, fringeleaf paspalum, and hooded windmillgrass. Woody vegetation consists mainly of live oaks, mesquite, pricklypear, and catclaw acacia. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Northern Rio Grande Plain; LRR I; MLRA 83A; moderate extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Karnes County, Texas; 1992. The name is coined from Nueces with siliceous mineralogy. 

REMARKS: These soils were formerly included in the Nueces series. Iron depletions are considered relic and not due to present day moisture conditions. Water table studies on similar soils indicate that there is minimal to no water saturation. These soils may have been deposited from a sandy source material by two different episodes comprising fairly uniform parent materials. 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon - 0 to 91 cm (0 to 36 in). (A and E horizons) 
Arenic feature - 0 to 91 cm (0 to 36 in). (A and E horizons) 
Argillic horizon - 91 to 183 cm (36 to 72 in). (Bt horizons)
