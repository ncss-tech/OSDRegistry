NOBSCOT SERIES

The Nobscot series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in wind-modified loamy and sandy sediments of Pleistocene age. These soils occur on undulating to hilly stream terraces of the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78B, 78C). Slope ranges from 0 to 20 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm (25 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Arenic Paleustalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON: Nobscot fine sand, on a convex 4 percent slope, in range, at an elevation of 535 m (1755 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Delwin, Devol, Eda, Grandfield, Springer, and Tivoli series. 
Delwin and Grandfield series: occur on adjacent or slightly lower areas that are slightly concave, have a sandy clay loam argillic horizon, and do not have a sandy surface layer greater than 50 cm (20 in)
Devol and Springer series: occur on slightly lower undulating to hummocky areas and do not have a sandy surface layer greater than 50 cm (20 in)
Eda and Tivoli series: occur on slightly higher hummocky or dune areas, do not have an argillic horizon, and are sandy throughout 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage class: well drained
Permeability: moderately rapid
Runoff: negligible on slopes less than 1 percent, very low on 1 to 5 percent slopes, and low on 5 to 20 percent slopes 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly as native range for beef cattle. Some of the undulating and hummocky areas are cultivated to sorghums, small grains, and alfalfa. Some areas are used for improved pasture. Native vegetation consists of shinnery oak with an understory of tall grasses. Near the eastern extent of these soils, the shinnery oak ranges up to 8 m (25 ft) tall and are in small circular areas intermingled with shrubby plants 1 to 1.5 m (2 to 5 ft) tall. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range
Region; Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78B, 78C) of Oklahoma and Texas. The series is extensive.
