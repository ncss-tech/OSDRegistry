NYTHAR SERIES 

The Nythar series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on glacial outwash plains, stream terraces, drainageways, alluvial fans and flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Cumulic Endoaquolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Nythar silty clay loam, in pasture (colors are for moist colors unless otherwise noted). 

     Oi--0 to 2 inches; partially decomposed organic matter 

     A--2 to 16 inches; black (N 2/0) silty clay loam, black (N 2/0) dry; moderate medium granular structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; common fine tubular pores; 5 percent cobbles, 5 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy  boundary. (8 to 15 inches thick) 

     Bg1--16 to 25 inches; very dark gray (N 3/0) silty clay loam, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; common fine and medium pores; 5 percent cobbles, 5 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary. 

     Bg2--25 to 36 inches; very dark gray (5Y 3/1) silty clay loam, gray (N 5/0) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common fine and medium pores; 5 percent cobbles, 5 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of Bg1 and Bg2 horizons is 15 to 25 inches) 

     Bg3--36 to 46 inches; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) silt loam, light gray (5Y 7/1) dry; many medium brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) redox concentrations; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common fine pores; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick) 

     Cg--46 to 60 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) cobbly silty clay loam, pale yellow (2.5Y 8/2) dry; many medium yellow (10YR 7/6) redox concentrations; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common fine pores; 15 percent cobbles and 10 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.2).
