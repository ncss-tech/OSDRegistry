NATICK SERIES

The Natick series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvial sands on stream terraces of valleys dissecting the Nebraska Sandhills (MLRA 65). Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C. (48 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 56 centimeters (22 inches) at the type location.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ipage and Saxman series. 
Ipage soils average less than 25 percent medium sand and 50 percent or more fine sand in the 25 to 100 centimeters (10 to 39 inches) control section. 
Saxman soils do not have carbonates. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Calamus, Thedford, Pivot and Valentine soils. 
Calamus soils are on floodplains and have an irregular decrease in organic matter between 25 and 125 centimeters (10 and 49 inches). 
Thedford (tentative) soils are on similar stream terraces and have mollic epipedons and an irregular decrease in organic matter between 25 and 125 centimeters (10 and 49 inches). 
Pivot soils are on lower stream terraces and are somewhat excessively drained having no seasonal zone of saturation or aquic conditions. 
Valentine soils are on dunes and are excessively drained having no seasonal zone of saturation or aquic conditions. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage: Moderately well drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: very high
Runoff: negligible 
Seasonal high water table: 61 to 183 centimeters ( 24 to 72 inches) to greater than 200 centimeters (80 inches).

USE AND VEGETATION: The major use is livestock grazing. Some areas are cultivated or hayed. Irrigated corn and alfalfa are the major crops. The rangeland native plant community for the sandy lowland ecological site (R065XY029NE) is principally sand bluestem, little bluestem, prairie sandreed, needle and thread, and blue grama. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Natick series is of small extent in and near the sandhills of Nebraska and South Dakota and mostly in LRR G, MLRA 65.. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Thomas County, Nebraska, 2010. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Aquic conditions: 67 centimeters to 200 centimeters (26 to 79 inches) (C2, 2C3, 2C4, and 2C5 horizons)
Lithologic Discontinuity: 93 to 200 centimeters (37 to 79 inches) (2C3, 2C4, and 2C5 horizons)
A calcareous phase of the Natick series may be needed. 
These soils were included with the Dunday, Ipage, and Valentine soils in older surveys. 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Data is available from the National Soil Survey Center, Soil Survey Laboratory for the typical pedon, Pedon ID 09NE171014.
