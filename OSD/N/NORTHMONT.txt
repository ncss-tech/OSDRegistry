DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage Class--moderately well drained

Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity Class--moderately high to high in the human-transported materials; high to very high in the fluviomarine deposits higher in areas where compacted mechanically (vibratory) or static (heavy traffic).

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses--These soils are used for residential, commercial, and recreational development in an urban or suburban setting.
Vegetation--Vegetation may include a mix of managed and unmanaged plant communities with a mix of native and non-native species. Many areas are vegetated with non-native ornamental landscaping and/or turfgrass associated with developed land uses. Some areas may exhibit weedy, invasive, and/or primary succession vegetation communities (e.g., abandoned lots and other unmanaged areas). Some small patches of mixed native hardwood forest may be present in undisturbed areas.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
General Area--Urban corridors of the Northern Coastal Plain with anthropogenic landscapes
Land Resource Regions--S - North Atlantic Slope Diversified Farming Region MLRA--149A
Extent--small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Camden County, New Jersey, 2024.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from a depth of 0 to 17 centimeters (^A horizon)
Cambic horizons--the zone from a depth of 17 to 56 centimeters (^Bw horizons)
Argillic horizons-the zone from a depth of 56 to 88 centimeters (2Btb horizons)
Aquic conditions-the zone from a depth of 65 to 203 centimeters. (2Btb2, 2BCb, and 2C horizons)
Lithologic discontinuity-- change of parent material from human-transported materials to fluviomarine deposits at a depth of 56 centimeters
Human-transported materials--the zone from a depth of 0 to 56 centimeters. (^A and ^Bw horizons)

This soil series classifies as an Ultisol due to diagnostic horizons that typically occur at the base of the human-transported materials and the whole soil profile is considered for classification.  Some pedons have an argillic horizons in a buried soil and are included in this concept at this time.

Some pedons have redoximorphic features in the human transported materials, these are thought to be relict features not indicative of a water table.
