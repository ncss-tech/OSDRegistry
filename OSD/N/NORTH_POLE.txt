.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, nonacid Aeric Cryaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON: North Pole very fine sandy loam - on a level plain at 540 feet elevation under tamarack and black spruce forest. (All colors are for moist soil)

    Oi--0 to 2 inches (0 to 6 cm); very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) slightly decomposed moss; common very fine to coarse roots; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary.
