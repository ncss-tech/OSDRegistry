NILESVAL SERIES

The Nilesval series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone. Nilesval soils are on inset fans. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 295 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series at this time. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nilesval soils are on inset fans. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent. These soils formed in alluvium derived from limestone. Elevations are 1,790 to 1,980 meters (5,870 to 6,500 feet). The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, intermittently moist summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with lesser secondary peak in the summer, typical of the Mojave Desert transitional to Great Basin. The mean annual precipitation is 260 to 330 millimeters; mean annual air temperature is 8 to 12 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 90 to 135 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Boxspring and Wamp soils. Wamp soils occur on fan remnants and have shallow, strongly cemented to indurated petrocalcic horizons. Boxspring soils are shallow to a lithic contact of limestone bedrock. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; low runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly fourwing saltbush, mountain big sagebrush, winterfat, threadleaf snakeweed, needle and thread, Indian ricegrass, blue grama and squirreltail. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southern Nevada, U.S.A.; MLRA 30. These soils are not extensive. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: PHOENIX, ARIZONA

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Desert National Wildlife Refuge Area, Nevada, South Part; Clark County, Nevada 2011. The name is coined from the common use name, Niles Valley, where the proposed series is located. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the profile are: 

Ochric epipedon - 0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches) (A and Bw horizons). 
Cambic horizon - 8 to 80 centimeters (3 to 31 inches) (Bw, Bk1 and Bk2). 
Particle-size control section - 25 to 100 centimeters (10 to 40 inches) (Part of the Bk1, Bk2 and part of the 2Bk1 horizons). 

Responsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 12/2015. The last revision to the series was 6/2011. ET
