MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Cecil County, Maryland; 1900.

REMARKS: The June, 1988 revision recognized the low activity clay properties of this soil as defined in the low activity clay amendment of Soil Taxonomy, August
1986. 10/2004, changed water table from 4.0-6.0 ft to 3.3-6.0 ft to cover depth that would be included in the typic subgroup versus associated soils in the Oxyaquic subgroup. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 14 inches (A and E horizons)
Kandic horizon--the zone between 14 and 70 inches (Bt horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone between depths of 14 and 70 inches (Bt horizon)
