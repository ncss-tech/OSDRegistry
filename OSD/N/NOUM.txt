NOUM SERIES

The Noum series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed from mixed sandy eolian deposits overlying gypsiferous eolian sands. These undulating soils are on dunes, interdunes, and fan piedmonts.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches (229 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F (18 degrees C).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy over coarse-gypseous, mixed over hypergypsic, superactive, thermic Typic Haplogypsids

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Slickcity series.  These soils

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Noum soils are on dunes, indterdunes, and fan piedmonts. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. These soils formed in mixed sandy eolian deposits overlying gypsiferous eolian sands. Elevation ranges from 3,940 to 5,020 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 64 to 70 degrees F. The frost-free period is 180 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Copia (NM), Wink (NM) and Pajarito (NM) series. Copia soils are sandy and do not have an underlying gypsic horizon. Wink soils are coarse-loamy and have a moderately deep calcic horizon. Pajarito soils are coarse loamy and do not have an underlying gypsic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat excessively drained; very low runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: The major uses are military exercises and wildlife habitat. Vegetation is mesa dropseed, giant dropseed, sand sagebrush, and soaptree yucca.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South central New Mexico, MLRA 42. The soils are of moderate extent.
