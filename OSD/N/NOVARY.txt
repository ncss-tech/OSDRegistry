NOVARY SERIES

The Novary series consists of very deep, poorly drained   soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on floodplains, drainageways, swales, and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous Cumulic Cryaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Novary silt loam, native cover (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A1--0 to 6 inches; dark gray (N 4/0) silt loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate fine crumb structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine to very fine and few medium roots; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.

    A2--6 to 26 inches; gray (N 5/0) silt loam, few thin 1/4- to 1-inch bands of sandy loam, black (10YR 2/1) and very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate thin platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of A horizons is 24 to 36 inches)

    Cg1--26 to 32 inches; gray (5Y 5/1) stratified silt loam and silty clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; few fine faint pale olive (5Y 6/3) redox concentrations, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium platy structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; few fine masses of lime; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.

    Cg2--32 to 42 inches; gray (5Y 5/1) stratified silt loam and silty clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; many fine distinct pale olive (5Y 6/4) redox concentrations, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; moderate medium platy structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.

    Cg3--42 to 60 inches; gray (5Y 6/1) gravelly clay loam, olive gray (5Y 5/2) moist; many coarse distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) redox concentrations, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) moist; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; 25 percent pebbles; moderately alkaline.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - flood plains, drainageways, stream terraces and swales.
Elevation - 4,200 to 7,500 feet.
Slope - 0 to 6 percent.
Parent material - alluvium.
Climate - long, cold winters; cool springs and summers.  Mean annual precipitation - 15 to 25 inches.
Mean annual temperature - 37 to 41 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 50 to 70 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Novary soils are used mainly for native pasture of sedge, baltic rush, muhly, timothy and iris; some areas are cut for hay.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Novary soils are inextensive distributed along the major drainageways in the intermountain valleys of the northern Rocky Mountains and in south central Colorado.
