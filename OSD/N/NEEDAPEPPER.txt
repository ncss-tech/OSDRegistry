NEEDAPEPPER SERIES 


The Needapepper series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in dominantly volcanic alluvium derived from mixed sources. Needapepper soils are on fan piedmont remnants. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 356 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Carey Lake, Dunford, Hades, Hurryback, Krueger, Lagnaf, Mahogan, Marotz, Moffspring, Nagle, Sag, Strom and Tusk series. Carey Lake soils are less than 76 centimeters to the base of their Bt horizons and have 2C horizons. Dunford and Mahogan soils have lithic contacts at depths of 50 to 100 centimeters. Hades soils have secondary carbonates at depths of 137 to 152 centimeters and 25 to 35 percent clay in their Bt horizons.

Hurryback, Krueger, Moffspring, Nagle, Sag, Strom and Tusk soils have a mollic epipedon 50 to 100 centimeters thick. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Needapepper soils are on Fan piedmont remnants. They formed in dominantly volcanic alluvium derived from mixed rock sources. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 1,676 to 1,981 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 400 millimeters, mean annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 60 to 80 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium surface runoff; moderate permeability (moderately high and high saturated hyraulic conductivity).

USE AND VEGETATION: Needapepper soils are used for rangeland, livestock grazing, watershed and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush and western needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern California, east of the Sierra Nevada Range in the western part of the Great Basin. These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 22.
