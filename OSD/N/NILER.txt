NILER SERIES

The Niler series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material derived from semiconsolidated shale.  These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid, shallow Gypsic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Niler silty clay loam, grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 3 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silty clay loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; weak fine platy structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine pores; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick)

    By--3 to 13 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silty clay loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; massive; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; few fine pores; 70 percent fine soft shale fragments; common fine nests of gypsum; disseminated lime; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 16 inches thick)

    Cr--13 to 60 inches; semiconsolidated shale that crushes to silty clay loam; few very fine roots in cracks; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Rosebud County, Montana; 100 feet north and 1,800 feet east of the SW corner of sec. 17, T. 9 N., R. 39 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil temperature - 41 to 47 degrees F.

Moisture control section - between 4 and 12 inches; dry in all parts between four-tenths and five-tenths of the cumulative days when the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. The soil has a ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.

Depth to By horizon - 2 to 4 inches.

Depth to semiconsolidated shale - 10 to 20 inches.

Some pedons have a C horizon above the By horizon.


A horizon - Texture:  clay loam or silty clay loam

Clay content:  27 to 35 percent

EC:  2 to 4 mmhos/cm

Reaction:  pH 7.9 to 8.4


Cy horizon - Texture:  clay loam or silty clay loam

Clay content:  27 to 35 percent

Rock fragments:  50 to 80 percent soft shale fragments

EC:  2 to 4 mmhos/cm

SAR:  3 to 10

Gypsum:  5 to 18 percent

Reaction:  pH 7.9 to 8.4


Cr horizon - EC:  8 to 20 mmhos/cm

SAR:  1 to 10

Reaction:  pH 7.9 to 8.4

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  (The Cabbart soils do not have a horizon of gypsum accumulation.)

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - sedimentary plains; hills.

Elevation - 2,700 to 3,000 feet.

Slope - 2 to 35 percent.

Parent material - residuum derived from semiconsolidated shale.

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; hot summers.

Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 14 inches.

Mean annual temperature - 39 to 45 degrees F.

Frost-free period - 100 to 135 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Niler soils are used mainly for rangeland.  Potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, western wheatgrass, needleandthread, forbs, and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Niler soils are of limited extent in southeastern Montana.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Rosebud County, Montana, 1985.  The name is that of an abandoned town in northern Rosebud County.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT0585.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches, mixed (A, By horizons); a gypsic horizon from 3 to 13 inches (By horizon); a paralithic contact at a depth of 13 inches (Cr horizon). Niler soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.
