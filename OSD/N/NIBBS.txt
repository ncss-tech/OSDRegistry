NIBBS SERIES



The Nibbs series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately

permeable soils on coalesced fan terraces.  They formed in mixed

alluvium of quartz latite and quartzite with some loess influence.

Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent.  The average annual temperature is

about 46 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 11

inches.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Haplocambids



TYPICAL PEDON: Nibbs gravelly silt loam--range.  On a 5 percent, single

slope, east aspect, 5000 feet elevation.  (The profile was moist below

4 inches when described on June 29, 1982.  Colors are for air-dry soil

unless otherwise stated.)

dark grayish brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak very fine granular structure;

soft, very friable and slightly plastic; 30 percent pebbles; mildly

alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 4 inches thick)



    A2--2 to 7 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, very dark

grayish brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak very thick platy structure parting

to moderate fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable,

slightly sticky, and plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many

very fine tubular pores; 10 percent pebbles; mildly alkaline (pH 7.8);

fine and fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 5 percent cobbles,

10 percent pebbles; mildly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (2

to 5 inches thick)

loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular

blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky, and

plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine and few fine tubular

pores; slightly effervescent; 20 percent pebbles; moderately alkaline

(pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 13 inches thick)



    2Bk1--18 to 31 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) very gravelly

loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky

structure; hard, very friable, sticky and plastic; few very fine roots;

many very fine and few fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; many

violently effervescent fine and medium irregularly shaped soft lime

seams and masses; 5 percent cobbles, 45 percent pebbles; rock fragments

coated with lime on all sides; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); clear wavy

boundary.  (8 to 19 inches thick)



    2Bk2--31 to 41 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) extremely

gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; hard and very

friable; few very fine roots; many very fine and few fine tubular

pores; 10 percent cobbles, 60 percent pebbles; rock fragments coated

with lime on all sides; strongly effervescent; common violently

effervescent fine and medium irregularly shaped, soft, lime seams and

masses; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 15

inches thick)



    3C--41 to 60 inches; multicolored stratified extremely gravelly

loamy coarse sand; single-grained; loose; few very fine roots; many

very fine irregular pores; 5 percent stones, 15 percent cobbles, 60

percent pebbles; rock fragments coated with lime on undersides;

strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bluegulch (T), Finley, Kiona, Mackey,

Minat, Veet and Veta series.  Bluegulch soils are deep to a lithic

contact, are over 18 inches to secondary lime, and have average annual

soil temperature greater than 51 degrees F.  Finley and Kiona soils

have an average annual soil temperature greater than 50 degrees F.

Mackey soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact.  Minat soils have

15 to 27 percent clay throughout the profile and lack very coarse

textures in the lower part of the profile.  Veet soils are moderately

coarse to coarse textured in the upper 24 inches.  Veta soils lack

secondary lime above 15 inches and lack a discontinuity within the

control section.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nibbs soils are on coalesced fan terraces.  Slopes

range from 2 to 8 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4800 to 5500 feet.

The soils formed in mixed alluvium with some loess influence.  The

average annual precipitation is about 8 to 12 inches and the average

annual air temperature is about 45 to 47 degrees F.  The frost free

season is 95 to 115 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Darkbull, Gunnell (T),

Kancan (T), and Womack (T) series.  Darkbull soils are calcareous to

the surface and lack a cambic horizon.  Gunnell soils have a duripan at

10 to 20 inches.  Kancan soils have a mollic epipedon.  Womack soils

have an argillic horizon and a duripan at 20 to 40 inches.  These soils

occur on coalesced fan terraces.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderately

permeable in the upper part and rapid to very rapid below.



USE AND VEGETATION: Nibbs soils are used for range and wildlife

habitat.  The potential natural vegetation is low sagebrush, bluebunch

wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass and bottlebrush squirriltail.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The soils of this series are inextensive in

southern Idaho.
