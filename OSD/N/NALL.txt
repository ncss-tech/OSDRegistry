NALL SERIES

The Nall series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in granitic residuum, colluvium, and local alluvium on uplands and have slopes of 8 to 30 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.; mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Aridic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Nall gravelly loam sand - woodland. (Colors are for dry soil unless, otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 5 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly loamy sand, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 20 percent fine gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 10 cm thick)

    A2--5 to 13 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and many very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 15 percent fine gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 20 cm thick)

    A3--13 to 20 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly coarse sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few medium, common fine and many very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 30 percent fine gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 20 cm thick)

    Cr--20 to 51 cm; decomposed granitic bedrock with some roots in fractures.

    R--51 cm; hard granitic bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION: Lyon County, Nevada, 4.2 miles east of the junction of State Highway 20 and the Sand Canyon road; 2,900 feet north and 1,500 feet east o; the SW corner of section 27, T. 9 N., R. 25 E.; USGS Nye Canyon 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 36 minutes 49 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 10 minutes 44 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.6136111 latitude, -119.1788889 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist in winter and early spring, dry late spring and through fall, aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C.
Depth to paralithic contact: 18 to 50 cm.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 18 to 30 cm.
Reaction:  Slightly acid or neutral.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  4 to 10 percent.
Rock fragments:  15 to 35 percent fine gravel.

A horizon 
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3.
Texture:  Gravelly sandy loam to gravelly loamy coarse sand.

C horizon 
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4.
Texture:  Gravelly sandy loam to gravelly loamy coarse sand.

COMPETING SERIES: These is the McCoin and Tincan series. 

McCoin and Tincan soils have more than 20 percent clay in the particle-size control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nall soils are on uplands with convex surfaces. The slopes are 8 to 30 percent. The soils formed in residuum, local alluvium, and colluvium derived from granitic bedrock. Elevations are 1,677 to 2,286 meters. The mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C.; and the mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm. Frost-free season is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hotsprings and Luppino series. Hotsprings soils are in concave areas and drainage channels.  They are very deep and have sandy textures throughout. Luppino soils have an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for woodland, wildlife habitat, watershed, and for limited grazing. Vegetation is principally pinyon pine with a sparse understory of big sagebrush, bitterbrush, green ephedra, Indian ricegrass and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Nevada. These soils are not extensive.
