NOVACAN SERIES

The Novacan series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed volcanic rocks.  Novacan soils are on fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Abruptic Xeric Argidurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Novacan cobbly loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The surface is covered by approximately 10 percent gravel and 25 percent cobbles.

    A1--0 to 8 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) cobbly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak thin platy structure parting to moderate fine granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 15 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (5 to 13 cm thick)

    A2--8 to 13 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very cobbly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine, common fine and medium roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 15 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 8 cm thick)

    Bt1--13 to 28 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/4) gravelly clay, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium angular blocky; hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine exped roots and few fine and medium roots; common fine interstitial pores; common distinct clay films on ped faces; 25 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 28 cm thick)

    Bt2--28 to 46 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; strong medium prismatic structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; common fine interstitial pores; common distinct clay films on ped faces and lining pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.  (13 to 28 cm thick)

    Btk--46 to 61 cm; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) moist; massive; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common faint clay films bridging mineral grains; 30 percent gravel; common fine carbonate in seams and as filaments or threads; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 25 cm thick)

    Bqkm--61 to 114 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) continuous strongly cemented duripan, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; massive; very hard, very firm; 15 percent gravel, 35 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones; patchy discontinuous thin laminar cap; common medium silica and carbonate coats and pendants on undersides of rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (18 to 53 cm thick)

    Bqk--114 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very cobbly loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; hard, firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine pores; 20 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; 50 percent discontinuous strong cementation; carbonate occurs in common fine concretions and seams; common medium silica and carbonate coats and pendants on undersides of rock fragments; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  Lander County, Nevada; about 18 miles east of Austin in Monitor Valley; approximately 1,900 feet south and 3,650 feet east of the northwest corner of section 6, T. l7 N., R. 47 E.; USGS Potts Well 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 20 minutes 40 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 42 minutes 41 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.3444444 latitude, -116.7113889 longitude. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in some part from November through June.  Dry July through October; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C.
Depth to duripan and base of argillic horizon: 50 to 76 cm.
Depth to carbonates: 36 to 60 cm.
Other features: These soils have an abrupt textural change at the A - B horizon boundary.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  45 to 60 percent. 
Rock fragments:  10 to 25 percent, mainly gravel.

A horizons
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Reaction:  Neutral or slightly alkaline.

Bt horizons
Hue:  10YR or 7.5YR.
Value:  4 through dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  4 or 6.
Reaction:  Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bogusrim, Catchell, Chilcott, Lockout, Lovejoy, Pigtail, Reno and Suncold series. 

Bogusrim, Catchell, Lookout and Suncold soils have a lithic contact within 152 cm. Chilcott soils have less than 5 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Lovejoy and Pigtail soils have an indurated duripan. Reno soils have an E horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Novacan soils are on fan piedmonts.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 1,895 to 2,135 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 cm; mean annual temperature is 6 to 9 degrees C; and the frost-free season is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Barrier, Glyphs, Muni and Orovada series.  These soils have less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Additionally, Glyphs and Orovada soils lack continuously strongly cemented duripans.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow or medium runoff; low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly black sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, Sandberg bluegrass, pine bluegrass, and littleleaf horsebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Nevada.  These soils are of small extent. MLRA 24, 28B.
