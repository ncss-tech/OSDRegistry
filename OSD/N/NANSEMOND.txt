MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  City of Suffolk, Virginia, 1979.

REMARKS: 1.  Nansemond soils were formerly mapped as Dragston soils until the Dragston classification was officially changed from Aquic Hapludults to Aeric Ochraquults.  2.  Differentiae between Foreston and Nansemond soils are not clean because of a difference in interpretation of the "pockets" and lenses of clean sand grains in Nansemond soils versus "skeletans" for these same features in Foreston soils.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 8 to 29 inches (Bt horizons)
Aquic conditions--the soil has redox depletions and concentrations within the upper 24 inches of the argillic horizon, with periodic saturation and reduction at some time during the year
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches

ADDITIONAL DATA: This pedon sampled as S95XX003-003.  Additional reference samples...
