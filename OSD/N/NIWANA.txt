NIWANA SERIES

The Niwana series consists of very deep, well drained soils.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits of the Lissie Formation of Pleistocene age.  These soils occupy mounds 50 to 200 feet in diameter and are 1/2 to 1 meter (1 to 3 ft) above the intermound landscape.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 19.4 degrees C (67 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1295 mm (51 in).

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Jasper County, Texas; 1980.

REMARKS:  This soil was formerly included with Elysian and Besner series.  The drainage class was changed from moderately well drained to well drained due to soil moisture monitoring on the map unit type location in Hardin County, Texas. The series type location was moved to Tyler County, Texas due to the availability of characterization data.

Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 35 cm (0 to 14 in) (A and E horizon)

Glossic horizon:35 to 203 (14 to 80 in (Btc/E and Btc/E horizons)

Argillic horizon:35 to 203 (14 to 80 in (Btc/E and Btcv/E horizons
