NORTHRIM SERIES

The Northrim series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Northrim soils are on hills, ridges, and in canyons.  Slopes range from 15 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Northrim cobbly loam, on a west facing, 30 percent slope, in Gambel oak at an elevation of 8,080 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on July 1 the soil profile was moist from 0 to 40 inches.

    The surface is covered by 5 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones, and 1 percent boulders.

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; partially decomposed litter consisting of oak leaves and twigs.

    A1--2 to 4 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) cobbly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots throughout; noneffervescent; 5 percent sandstone gravel, 20 cobbles, and 1 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary. 

    A2--4 to 9 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) cobbly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate very fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots throughout; few very fine discontinuous tubular pores; noneffervescent; 5 percent sandstone gravel, 20 percent cobbles, and 1 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary. 

    Bt1--9 to 22 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) cobbly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and common fine roots throughout; few very fine discontinuous tubular pores; many faint continuous clay films on the faces of peds; noneffervescent; 10 percent sandstone gravel, 15 percent cobbles, and 1 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. 

    Bt2--22 to 40 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and medium roots throughout; few very fine discontinuous tubular pores; common faint patchy clay films on the faces of peds; noneffervescent; 10 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles from sandstone; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual smooth boundary. 

    Bt3--40 to 48 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) clay loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots throughout; few very fine discontinuous tubular pores; few faint patchy clay films on the faces of peds; noneffervescent; 10 percent sandstone gravel and 2 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual smooth boundary. 

    Bt4--48 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) clay loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots throughout; few faint patchy clay films on the faces of peds; noneffervescent; 10 percent gravel and 2 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Alderon, Allens Park, Bayerton, Belltower, Elbeth, Elbuck, Elmark, Hoyt, Jemco, Kunz, Losindios, Lumpgulch, Plome, Rule, Shoemaker, Sweetweed, and Tunitcha series. Potential competitors still classified as Eutroboralfs are Eaglecreek, Fairport, Haugan, and Jemez series. Alderon, Allens Park, Bayerton, Belltower, Eaglecreek, Elmark, Fairport, Jemco, Jemez, Lumpgulch, Rule and Shoemaker soils are moderately deep. Elbeth soils are weathered from schist and granite and have albic horizons. Elbuck soils receive 24 to 26 inches of precipitation. Haugan soils have visible secondary carbonates. Hoyt soils are moist in the spring and have more influence from granite and till material. Kunz soils are dry in any part of the moisture control section for 90 or more cumulative days in most years.  Losindios soils contain more than 50 percent sand in the argillic horizon.  Plome soils are redder than 7.5YR in the Bt horizon. Sweetwater soils have glossic horizons, are more moist in the spring, and formed in colluvium from volcanic mudflow breccia. Tunitcha soils have a C horizon with less than 15 percent clay.    

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 

Parent material: slope alluvium, and colluvium derived from sandstone and shale

Landform: hills, canyons, and ridges

Slopes: 15 to 40 percent

Elevation: 7,800 to 8,300 feet

Mean annual temperature: 43 to 47 degrees F

Mean annual precipitation: 17 to 22 inches

Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year with July and August being slightly wetter and June being slightly dryer. 

Frost-free period: 80 to 100 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Trag, Sheek and Beje soils.  Trag soils have a mollic epipedon.  Sheek soils are skeletal. Beje soils have a mollic epipedon and are shallow.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: well drained, very high runoff, slow permeability

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for grazing, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  Native vegetation is Gambel's oak, snowberry, serviceberry, fendlerbush, grasses and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwest Colorado.  LRR D, MLRA 39.  This series is of small extent.
