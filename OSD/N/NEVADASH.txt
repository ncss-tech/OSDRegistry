NEVADASH SERIES

The Nevadash series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium. Nevadash soils are on fan piedmonts, basins, and fan aprons. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Qwynn and Watoopah series. Qwynn and Watoopah soils have a soil temperature warmer than 11.1 degrees C. and are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days between July and October.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nevadash soils are on fan piedmonts, fan aprons and basins. These soils formed in mixed alluvium of mostly volcanic origin, high in pyroclastic materials. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Elevations are 1,368 to 1,814 meters. The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 7.2 to 10.0 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Couch, Gorzell and Saraph series. Couch soils have clayey natric horizons. Gorzell soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal. Saraph soils are shallow over tuff.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very low runoff; moderate saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Rangeland and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is mainly big sagebrush, spiny hopsage, basin wildrye, and thickspike wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Washoe County, Nevada, Surprise Valley-Home Camp Area. MLRA 23. These soils are not extensive.
