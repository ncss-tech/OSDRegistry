NAMLOT SERIES

The Namlot series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from sandstone.  Namlot soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 3 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, siliceous, superactive, frigid Lithic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Namlot extremely cobbly sandy loam, on a southwest facing, 15 percent slope in a ponderosa pine forest at an elevation of 7,900 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    The surface is covered by forest letter of needles, twigs, and cones about 0.5 to 2 inches thick; and by 5 percent stones, 15 percent gravel, and 25 percent cobbles.

    A1--0 to 1 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) extremely cobbly sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak thin platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine roots; common very fine and fine, few medium tubular pores; 5 percent stones, 15 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary.

    A2--1 to 3 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/3) extremely cobbly sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to medium very fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine roots; many very fine, common fine, few medium tubular pores; 5 percent stones, 25 percent gravel, 40 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (combined thickness of A horizon is 2 to 9 inches)

    Bt1--3 to 7 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very cobbly sandy clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure parting to moderate very fine and fine subangular blocky; hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine, common medium tubular pores; 5 percent stones, 20 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; neutral (pH 7.3); clear wavy boundary.

    Bt2--7 to 17 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) extremely cobbly sandy clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine and fine, common medium tubular pores; 5 percent stones, 25 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles; few distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (combined thickness of Bt horizon is 8 to 11 inches)

    R--17 inches; unweathered sandstone bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Uintah County, Utah; about 1 mile south of Warren Peak; located about 200 feet west and 2,500 feet north of the southeast corner of sec. 19, T. 1 S., R. 24 E.; Blair Basin USGS quad; lat. 40 degrees 43 minutes 17 seconds N. and long. 109 degrees 15 minutes 36 seconds W., NAD 27

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture: The moisture control section is affected by precipitation that is distributed evenly throughout the year with a slight increase in late summer and early fall.  Typic Ustic moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature:  42 to 45 degrees F.
Depth to lithic contact:  10 to 20 inches to sandstone bedrock
Thickness of the mollic epipedon:  7 to 17 inches

Particle-size control section:  18 to 27 percent clay, 40 to 80 percent rock fragments

A horizon:
Hue:  5YR or 7.5YR
Value:  3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma:  1 to 3 moist
Rock fragments:  60 to 75 percent sandstone fragments, predominantly cobble, with gravel and stones

Bt horizon:
Hue:  5YR or 7.5YR
Value:  3 to 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma:  2 to 4
Texture:  very cobbly sandy loam, extremely cobbly sandy loam, very cobbly sandy clay loam, extremely cobbly sandy clay loam
Rock fragments:  40 to 80 percent sandstone fragments, predominantly cobble with gravel and stones
Reaction:  neutral or slightly alkaline 

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no current competitors.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from sandstone
Landform:  mountain slopes
Slopes:  3 to 40 percent
Elevation: 6,800 to 8,600 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  40 to 43 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  16 to 22 inches.
Frost-free period:  70 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bigtom, Cortyzack, Clyl, Flynncove, and Dokie series.  

Bigtom, Cortyzack, Clyl, Flynncove, and Dokie soils are very deep.

Clyl soils have a calcic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  well drained, medium and high runoff, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major uses are woodland, rangeland, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  The native plant community consists of ponderosa pine, bluegrass, elk sedge, needleandthread, mountain big sagebrush, and antelope bitterbrush.  These soils have been correlated to a Mountain Shallow Sandy Loam (Ponderosa Pine) - 047CY453UT range site in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Utah.  LRR E, MLRA 47.  This series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Uintah County, Uintah Area Soil Survey, Utah, 1998.  The name is coined.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section:  The zone from 3 to 17 inches.  (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 17 inches.  (A and  Bt horizons)
Argillic horizon:  The zone from 3 to 17 inches.  (Bt horizons)
Lithic contact:  The contact with sandstone bedrock at 17 inches.  (R layer)
Siliceous mineralogy:  Mineralogy is inferred from lab samples taken on similar geology and landforms in the area.

The cation exchange activity class was inferred from laboratory data from similar soils in the Uintah Area Soil Survey.

The surface texture modifier was determined following the guidelines outlined in the Utah document, "Procedures for Distributing Rock Fragments on the Surface Layer into the Upper 6 inches of Soil and Subsequent Naming of Map Units, April 1979."

The classification was changed from Lithic Argiborolls to frigid Lithic Argistolls 8/98.
