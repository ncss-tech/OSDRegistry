NISSLER SERIES

The Nissler series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium from rhyolite and other moderately fine-grained igneous rocks.  These soils are on mountains, hills and ridges.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 432 millimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Ashy, glassy Vitrandic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Nissler gravelly ashy loam, in rangeland on a 17 percent slope at 1,768 meters elevation (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise indicated).

    A--0 to 23 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly ashy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; very friable, soft, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, few medium roots; many fine interstitial and irregular pores; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (18 to 30 cm thick)

    Bt--23 to 71 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly ashy sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable, hard, moderately sticky and very plastic; common fine roots; common fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.  (15 to 70 cm thick)

    BC--71 to 153 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) very gravelly ashy sandy clay loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; common fine irregular pores; 30 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary.

    R--153 cm; indurated tuffaceous rhyolite.

COMPETING SERIES:
Hashwoods (NV) - is deep to a paralithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - mountain slopes, hills and ridges 
Elevation - 1,585 to 2,220 meters
Slope - 4 to 30 percent 
Parent material - alluvium and or colluvium derived from rhyolite, rhyodacite, or rhyolitic tuff
Climate - long, cold winters; cold, moist springs; short, cool summers
Mean annual precipitation - 305 to 508 millimeters, much of which falls as snow and as spring rain
Mean annual air temperature - 1 to 6 degrees centigrade
Frost-free period - 30 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chinaspring, Euell and Brownsgulch soil series which occur on similar landforms.  Chinaspring soils have horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation..  Euell soils are deep to a lithic contact.  Brownsgulch soils are coarse-loamy and have a mollic epipedon that is greater than 40 cm thick.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Nissler soils are used mainly for timber production and understory grazing. Potential native vegetation is Douglas-fir, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, rough fescue, prairie junegrass, big sagebrush and common juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Nissler soils are of small extent in the intermontane basins of central Montana. MLRA 43B.
