NARROWS SERIES

The Narrows series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium or lacustrine deposits.  These soils occur on flood plains, stream terraces, drainageways, depressional areas and lakebeds.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic Vertic Cryaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Narrows silty clay, grassland (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted).

   Oi--0 to 5 cm; organic layer consisting mainly of slightly decomposed grass roots. (0 to 8 cm thick)

(15 to 50 cm thick)

   BCkg2--76 to 152 cm; mixed colors, dark gray (5Y 4/1) and brown (7.5YR 4/2) gravelly clay loam, gray (5Y 5/1) and brown (7.5YR 5/2) dry; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; accumulation of finely disseminated calcium carbonate; 20 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3).
