NESSEN SERIES

The Nessen series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils on lake plains, outwash plains, and moraines. These soils formed in sandy material overlying calcareous sand and gravelly material. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Typic Haplorthods

TYPICAL PEDON: Nessen sand, on a slope of less than 1 percent in a woodland setting at an elevation of 248 meters (815 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 A--0 to10 cm (4 inches); black (5YR 2.5/1) sand, dark gray (5YR 4/1) dry; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many very fine and fine and common medium and coarse roots; about 5 percent gravel; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. [2 to 13 cm (1 to 5 inches) thick]

 E--10 to 28 cm (4 to 11 inches); reddish gray (5YR 5/2) sand, pinkish gray (5YR 7/2) dry; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; many very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; about 5 percent gravel; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. [10 to 25 cm (4 to 10 inches) thick]

 Bhs--28 to 38 cm (11 to 15 inches); dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) sand; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; common fine and many medium and coarse roots; about 5 percent gravel; moderately acid; clear irregular boundary. [8 to 15 cm (3 to 6 inches) thick]

 Bs1--38 to 61 cm (15 to 24 inches); reddish brown (5YR 4/4) sand; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; very friable, common medium and coarse roots; about 5 percent gravel; moderately acid; gradual irregular boundary.   

 Bs2--61 to 99 cm (24 to 39 inches); strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) sand; single grain; loose; few medium and coarse roots; 8 percent gravel; moderately acid; clear irregular boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bs horizon is 51 to 89 cm (20 to 35 inches).]

 Bt--99 to 112 cm (39 to 44 inches); dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) gravelly sand; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; common very fine and fine and few medium and coarse roots; patchy faint clay bridging between sand grains; 20 percent gravel; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. [2 to 13 cm (1 to 5 inches) thick]

 2C--112 to 203 cm (44 to 80 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) stratified sand (5 percent gravel) and gravelly sand (20 percent gravel); single grain; loose; few medium and coarse roots in the upper 30 cm (12 inches); slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline. 

TYPE LOCATION: Benzie County, Michigan about 4 miles east of the village of Honor; 2480 feet south and 1800 feet west of the northeast corner of sec. 18, T. 26 N., R. 13 W., Inland Township; USGS Platte River, Michigan 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; lat. 44 degrees 39 minutes 07.1 seconds N. and long. 85 degrees 55 minutes 33.5 seconds W., NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Kaleva and Lynden series. Kaleva soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 140 cm (55 inches). Lynden soils are in areas that receive more than 813 mm (32 inches) of mean annual precipitation. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nessen soils are on lake plains, outwash plains, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. These soils formed in sandy material overlying calcareous sand and gravelly material. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 813 mm (30 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.3 to 8.9 degrees C (47 to 48 degrees F). Elevation is 183 to 305 meters (600 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kaleva, Benzonia, Brethren, Coverts, Pipestone, and Dair soils. The Kaleva and somewhat excessively drained Benzonia soils are on landform positions similar to those of the Nessen soils. The Brethren and Covert soils are moderately well drained; the Pipestone soils are somewhat poorly drained; and the Dair soils are poorly drained or very poorly drained.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Excessively drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to low depending on the slope. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high. Permeability is rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of the Nessen soils are forested or are idle. Some areas are used for orchard crops, small grains and hay.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 96 in northwestern lower peninsula of Michigan. The series is of moderate extent.
