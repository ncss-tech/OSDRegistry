 Cg1--25 to 61 cm (10 to 24 inches); dark greenish gray (5GY 3/1) silt loam; massive; friable; slightly sticky, slightly plastic; n-value greater than 1.0, material flows easily between the fingers when squeezed; common fine faint light gray (10YR 7/2) iron depletions; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary. 

 Cg2--61 to 203 cm (24 to 80 inches); dark greenish gray (5GY 4/1) silty clay loam; massive; firm; moderately sticky, moderately plastic; n-value greater than 1.0, material flows easily between the fingers when squeezed; common fine faint light gray (10YR 7/2) iron depletions; moderately acid. 

TYPE LOCATION: Dorchester County, Maryland, about 5,000 feet NNW of Brookview, Maryland and Route 14; about 3,000 feet west of Puckum Road on the west side of the Marshyhope Creek, 30 feet into the tidal marsh; USGS Rhodesdale topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 35 minutes 19 seconds N. and longitude 75 degrees 48 minutes 9 seconds W., NAD 83; Major Land Resource Area 153D

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Dorchester County, Maryland, 1992 

REMARKS: Nanicoke soils were formerly included in tidal marsh miscellaneous area. 

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 25 cm (Ag horizon)
High n-value--the zone from 0 to 200 cm has an n-value greater than 1.0, the material flows easily between the fingers
Aquic conditions--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 200 cm is periodically saturated (endosaturation)
