NUNACHUAK SERIES

The Nunachuak series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in organic material over silty and loamy alluvium on flood plains. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 630 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 0.6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, isotic, acid Typic Cryaquents

TYPICAL PEDON: Nunachuak mucky silt, located on a flood plain with a slope of 1 percent and elevation of 10 meters; when described on August 30th, 2009 the soil was saturated from 50 to 183 cm (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted)

 Oi--0 to 9 cm; peat; nonsticky, nonplastic; many fine roots, many medium roots, and few coarse roots; very strongly acid (pH 4.6); clear smooth boundary

 A--9 to 18 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) mucky silt; 13 percent sand; 82 percent silt; 5 percent clay; weak medium granular structure; friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common fine roots, many medium roots, and few coarse roots; very strongly acid (pH 4.9); gradual smooth boundary

 Cg1--18 to 41 cm; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) silt; 13 percent sand; 82 percent silt; 5 percent clay; massive; firm, slightly sticky, nonplastic; common fine roots, few medium roots, and few coarse roots; 15 percent medium brown (7.5YR 4/4) masses of oxidized iron with clear boundaries; strongly acid (pH 5.1); clear smooth boundary

 2Cg2--41 to 110 cm; gray (5Y 5/1) stratified silt loam; 40 percent sand; 50 percent silt; 10 percent clay; massive; firm, slightly sticky, nonplastic; few fine roots, few medium roots, and few coarse roots; 10 percent medium brown (7.5YR 4/4) masses of oxidized iron with clear boundaries; 5 percent nonflat 2 to 75 millimeter fragments; strongly acid (pH 5.5); clear smooth boundary

 3Cg3--110 to 183 cm; dark greenish gray (10Y 4/1) sandy loam; massive; 5 percent medium dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) masses of oxidized iron with clear boundaries; moderately acid (pH 5.8)
