NALAKIHU SERIES

The Nalakihu series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in relict lava flows derived from basalt. Nalakihu soils are on lava plains, lava fields, and plateaus. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches (203 millimeters) and the mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F. (12.8 degrees C.)

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Vitrandic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Nalakihu loamy sand - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

  C--0 to 3 inches (0 to 7 cm); dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) loamy sand, very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2), moist; 5 percent clay; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; interstitial pores; 5 percent cobbles and 5 percent cinders; slightly effervescent, 2 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline, pH 8.4; abrupt smooth boundary.

  2A--3 to 7 inches (7 to 17 cm); pink (5YR 7/3) gravelly sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4), moist; 18 percent clay; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many interstitial pores; 5 percent cobbles and 10 percent gravels; strongly effervescent, 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline, pH 8.4; gradual smooth boundary.

  2Bk1--7 to 17 inches (17 to 42 cm); light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) sandy clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4), moist; 22 percent clay; moderate subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and common fine roots throughout; many very fine dendritic tubular pores; many irregular carbonate masses around rock fragments and carbonate, finely disseminated in matrix; 5 percent gravels and 7 percent cobbles; violently effervescent, 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; strongly alkaline, pH 8.6; gradual smooth boundary.

  2Bk2--17 to 27 inches (42 to 67 cm); pinkish gray (5YR 7/2) gravelly loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/3), moist; 20 percent clay; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots throughout; common very fine dendritic tubular pores; common irregular carbonate masses around rock fragments and carbonate, finely disseminated in matrix; 5 percent cobbles and 15 percent gravels; violently effervescent, 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; strongly alkaline, pH 8.6; abrupt smooth boundary.

  2R--27 inches (67 cm); fractured, unweathered basalt bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nalakihu soils are on lava plains, lava fields and plateaus at elevations of 4,662 to 5,705 feet (1,421 to 1,739 meters). Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. These soils formed in relict lava flows derived from basalt. The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches (152 to 254 millimeters) and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains and snowfall during December and January. The mean annual air temperature is 54 to 57 degrees Fahrenheit (12.2 to 13.9 degrees Celsius). The frost-free period is 150 to 180 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Miburn (AZ), Moenkopie (AZ), and Trachute (AZ), soils. Miburn soils have an abrupt textural change, and are very deep. Moenkopie soils are very shallow and shallow to bedrock. Trachute soils are deep and very deep in terrace deposits.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium or high runoff; moderately low or moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Vegetation includes galleta, oneseed Juniper, Russian thistle, black grama, needle and thread, and alkali sacaton. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Arizona. Nalakihu soils are of limited extent. This soil is named after a ruin near the type location. MLRA 35 Land Resource Unit 35.2.
