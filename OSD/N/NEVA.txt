NEVA SERIES

The Neva series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountain slopes and ridges.  They formed in a mixture of loess and material weathered from granite, gneiss, quartzite or schist with a thin mantle of volcanic ash. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.  Slope ranges from 5 to 70 percent.  The average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 40 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  

Fan Lake soils: have an E horizon and fragic properties at a depth of 20 to 40 inches

Fugawee soils:  are moderately deep to a paralithic contact 

Henneway soils:  are deep to a lithic contact 

Tahand soils:  are deep to a paralithic contact

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Neva soils are on mountain slopes and ridges.  Slopes range from 5 to 70 percent.  These soils formed in a mixture of loess and material weathered from granite, quartzite, gneiss or schist with a thin mantle of volcanic ash. Elevations are 2,700 to 4,200 feet (823 to 1280 meters).  The average annual temperature ranges from 40 to 46 degrees F., with an average annual precipitation of 30 to 45 inches (762 to 1143 mm).  The frost-free period ranges from 80 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Noil, Brequito, Brodeer and Carlinton series.  Noil soils are loamy-skeletal and occur on steep south to west facing mountain slopes. Brequito and Brodeer soils have a udic moisture regime and occur on mountain slopes and ridges. Carlinton soils have a fragipan and occur on hills on loess covered basalt plateaus.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained. moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed. Potential natural vegetation is mainly grand fir, Douglas-fir, western white pine and ponderosa pine with an understory of mallow ninebark, creambush oceanspray, common snowberry, Columbia brome, American trailplant, baldhip rose, heart leaf arnica, goldthread, Pipers anemone and bracken fern.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Idaho.  This soil is not extensive.
