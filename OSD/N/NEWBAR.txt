NEWBAR SERIES

The Newbar series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium from mixed rocks on low terraces and gravel bars on mountain valley floors. Newbar soils are saturated with flowing water that fluctuates in depth with stream flow.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and mean annual temperature about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Oxyaquic Xerofluvents 

TYPICAL PEDON: Newbar gravelly sandy loam - wet woodlands and meadows, on a 0 percent slope at an elevation of 3,810 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted. Soil textures are apparent field textures.)

  A--0 to 6 inches; very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) dry; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; few very fine and common fine irregular pores; 45 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 7 inches thick)

  C1--6 to 23 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) very gravelly loamy sand, brown (7.5YR 4/3) dry; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine and few medium roots; common fine irregular pores; 50 percent gravel, and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.9); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 20 inches thick)

  C2--23 to 35 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) extremely gravelly loamy sand, brown (7.5YR 5/4) dry; single grain; slightly hard, loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few fine irregular pores; 55 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles, and 2 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 25 inches thick)

  C3--35 to 38 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) dry; common medium distinct reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) redox concentrations; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine irregular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 3 inches thick)

  C4--38 to 61 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) dry; single grain structure; very hard, loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine irregular pores; 50 percent gravel, and 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).
