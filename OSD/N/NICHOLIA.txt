NICHOLIA SERIES

The Nicholia series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from limestone.  Nicholia soils are on outwash fans, alluvial fans and fan terraces and have slopes of 0 to 20 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy, carbonatic, shallow Duric Xeric Petrocryids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Nicholia gravelly loam -- rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

	A--0 to 2 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak thin platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; 25 percent gravel; strongly effervescent (35 percent calcium carbonate); moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 7 inches thick)

	Bk--2 to 14 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hare, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; 15 percent gravel; strongly effervescent (60 percent calcium carbonate); moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (6 to 13 inches thick)

	2Bkqm--14 to 15 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) indurated duripan, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; abrupt smooth boundary.  (1/2 to 3 inches thick)

	2Bkq1--15 to 31 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; very hard, very firm; nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots in cracks and seams; discontinuous cementation by silica and lime; a laminar cap less than 2mm thick at 15 inches; 85 percent gravel; violently effervescent (65 percent calcium carbonate); moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 20 inches thick)

	2Bkq2--31 to 37 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely gravelly sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; very hard, very firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and few fine roots in cracks and seams; discontinuous cementation by silica and lime; 75 percent gravel; violently effervescent (75 percent calcium carbonate); very strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (6 to 10 inches thick)

	2Bkq3--37 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; single grain; loose; nonsticky and nonplastic; common silica pendants on underside of coarse fragments; 80 percent gravel; violently effervescent (65 percent calcium carbonate); very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2).

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Windcoat series.  Windcoat soils have duripans more than 3 inches thick.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nicholia soils are on outwash fans, alluvial fans and fan terraces.  Elevations range from 6,000 to 7,500 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  The soils formed in coarse alluvium derived dominantly from limestone.  The climate is cold and moist in winter dry in summer.  Average annual precipitation range from 8 to 11 inches.  Average summer temperature is 55 to 58 degrees F. and average annual temperature is 35 to 40 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 30 to 60 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bluedome, Windcoat and Surrett soils.  Bluedome soils are moderately deep to a strongly cemented pan.  Surret soils have a mollic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow or medium runoff; moderate over very rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The soils are used dominantly for rangeland.  Vegetation is mainly low sage and bluebunch wheatgrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho.  These soils are moderately extensive.
