NOBLETON SERIES
The Nobleton series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in thick sandy and loamy sediments of marine origin.  These soils are on broad nearly level and gently sloping coastal plain areas in Peninsular
Florida.  They have a perched water table above the argillic
horizon during the summer rainy season.  Water runs off the
surface slowly.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.
TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, mixed, subactive, hyperthermic Aquic Arenic Paleudults
TYPICAL PEDON:  Nobleton fine sand on a gentle slope, in
cultivation.
       (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise
stated.)

weak fine granular structure; very friable; common fine roots;
medium acid; clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)
     A21--7 to 22 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) fine sand; single

fine roots; medium acid; clear wavy boundary.  (9 to 14 inches
thick)
     B21t--33 to 37 inches; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) sandy clay loam; common medium distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) and
yellowish red (5YR 5/6) mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; sand grains coated and bridged with clay; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (3 to 7
inches thick)
     B22t--37 to 60 inches; mottled yellowish red (5YR 4/6),
strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), brown (10YR 5/3), and gray (10YR 6/1)
sandy clay; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots; common discontinuous clay films on surface of peds;
about 4 percent plinthite; few nodules of ironstone; very strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (10 to 25 inches thick)
     B23tg--60 to 80 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) sandy clay
loam; many medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) and yellowish red (5YR 4/6) mottles and common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) mottles; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; very few fine roots; very strongly acid; clear wavy
boundary.  (15 to 25 inches thick)
     B3g--80 to 85 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy clay
loam; common medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) and
yellowish red (5YR 4/6), and common medium distinct red (2.5YR
4/6) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) mottles; weak medium
subangular blocky structure; friable; common loamy sand pockets; extremely acid.
TYPE LOCATION:  Hernando County, Florida; about 0.6 mile north of Government Road and 100 feet west of U. S. Highway 41 on Plant Materials Center; SE1/4NW1/4 sec. 30, T. 21 S., R. 20 E.
RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 60 inches or more.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid in the A horizon and from strongly acid to extremely acid in the Bt
horizon.
The A1 or Ap horizon has color in hue 10YR, value 3 through 5,
chroma 1 or 2.  The A2 horizon has color in hue 10YR, value 5
through 7, chroma 3 or 4, with or without mottles.  Total
thickness of the A horizon is 20 to 40 inches.  Texture is fine
sand or loamy fine sand.
The B21t horizon has color in hue 10YR, value 5 through 7, chroma
3 through 8; or hue 7.5YR, value 5 or 6, chroma 6 through 8.  Few
to common mottles with chroma 2 or less are within this horizon.  Texture of the B21t horizon is sandy clay loam or sandy clay.  The B22t horizon is mottled in hue 10YR, value 5 or 6, chroma 3
through 8; hue 10YR, value 5 through 7, chroma 2 or less; hue
7.5YR, value 5 or 6, chroma 6 or 8; and, hue 5YR, value 4 through
6, chroma 6 or 8; or the matrix has color in hue 10YR, value 5 or
6, chroma 3 through 8 with few to many distinct mottles in hue, value, and chroma listed above.  Texture of the B22t horizon is
sandy clay.  The B23tg and B3g horizons have color in hue 10YR or 2.5Y, value 5 through 7, chroma 2 or less with few to many mottles
in hue, value, and chroma described for the B22t horizon.  Texture
is sandy clay or sandy clay loam with pockets and lenses of fine sandy loam or loamy sand in the B3g horizon.
COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Blichton, Fuquay, Jumper,
Kendrick, Leefield, Lochloosa, Lucy, Ocilla, Sparr, Stilson, and Wagram series.  All these soils have loamy particle class and siliceous mineralogy.  Fuquay, Lucy, Ocilla, Stilson, and Wagram soils have temperatures less than 72 degrees F. at depths 20
inches below the soil surface.  In addition, Blichton, Fuquay, Jumper, Leefield, and Stilson soils have more than 5 percent plinthite within depths of 60 inches below the soil surface.  Kendrick, Lucy, and Wagram soils lack chroma 2 mottles in the
upper 5 inches of the argillic horizon.  Sparr soils have A
horizons 40 to 80 inches thick.
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nobleton soils are on broad nearly level and gently sloping Coastal Plain uplands in Peninsular Florida.
Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation
ranges from about 50 to 55 inches, but is not evenly distributed throughout the year.  Heaviest rainfall occurs during the summer
from about July to October.  Mean annual temperature is about 73 degrees F.
GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Blichton and Kendrick series, and the Arredondo, Flemington, Hague,
Kanapaha, and Micanopy series.  Arrendondo soils are better
drained and have A horizons 40 to 80 inches thick.  Flemington and Kanapaha soils are more poorly drained.  In addition, Flemington soils have A horizons less than 20 inches thick and an abrupt textural change between the A and Btg horizons.  Kanapaha soils
have A horizons 40 to 80 inches thick.  Hague soils are better drained, have loamy particle size class, siliceous mineralogy, and high base saturation.  Micanopy soils have high base saturation
and A horizons less than 20 inches thick.
DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Nobleton soils are somewhat poorly drained.  Runoff is slow, and permeability is moderately slow.  A perched water table is at depths of 20 to 40 inches for 1 to 4
months during the summer rainy season in most years.
USE AND VEGETATION:  Large areas of these soils are cleared.  Improved pasture is the dominant use.  Some cleared areas are used for citrus, tomatoes, corn, peanuts, and watermelons.  Native vegetation consists of slash and longleaf pines, hickory,
magnolia, sweetgum, and live, laurel, and water oaks.  Understory vegetation is southern bayberry, briers, and native grasses.  DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Coastal Plain of Peninsular Florida.
