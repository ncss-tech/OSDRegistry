ISHKOTEN SERIES

The Ishkoten series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium over residuum derived from shale and sandstone.  Ishkoten soils are on hillslopes and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 3 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 457 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Typic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ishkoten cobbly sandy loam, on a west facing, convex 33 percent slope in ponderosa pine woodland at an elevation of 2,438 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on July 7, 1999 the soil was moist throughout.

    Oi--0 to 3 cm; slightly decomposed pine and oak litter. (0 to 5 cm thick)

    A--3 to 15 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) cobbly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; 5 percent stones, 15 percent cobble, and 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 18 cm thick)

    Bt1--15 to 28 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/3) cobbly sandy clay, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; strong fine angular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; many distinct clay films on ped faces; 10 percent cobble and 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 18 cm thick)

    Bt2--28 to 56 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) cobbly sandy clay, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; strong medium and fine angular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine, medium, and coarse roots; common very fine tubular pores; many distinct clay films on ped faces; 7 percent cobble, 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual smooth boundary. (combined thickness of Bt1, Bt2 is 30 to 56 cm)

    Bt3--56 to 86 cm; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) sandy clay loam, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine, medium, and coarse roots; common very fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on ped faces; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual smooth boundary.

    Cr--86-122 cm; weakly cemented sandstone with faint clay films in cracks
