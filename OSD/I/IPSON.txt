IPSON SERIES

The Ipson series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from basic and intermediate igneous rocks. Ipson soils occur on mountain slopes and alluvial fans and have slopes of 1 to 50 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 305 mm (12 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcidic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Ipson very cobbly loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(6 to 18 inches (15 to 46 cm) thick) 

  Bk1--14 to 25 inches (36 to 64 cm); very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; weakly cemented; friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine medium and coarse roots; few fine pores; 25 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual wavy boundary. 

  Bk2--25 to 36 inches (64 to 91 cm); very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 25 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear wavy boundary. 

  C--36 to 60 inches (91 to 152 cm); light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; single grain; loose; few fine roots; few fine pores; 40 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

S. 89 Junction; about 1,600 feet west and 1,600 feet south of the NE corner of section 16, T. 31 S., R. 3 W.; USGS Mount Dutton 7.5 minute quadrangle; lat. 38 degrees 7 minutes 0.5 seconds N. and long. 112 degrees 12 minutes 6.0 seconds W., NAD 83. 
 
RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Circleville, Dacore, Dullknife, Nebies, Sieben, Uracca and Widtsoe series. 
Circleville soils are moderately deep over bedrock.
Dacore soils have aridic soil moisture regimes and Btk horizons.
Dullknife soils are moderately deep over limestone bedrock.
Nebies and Sieben soils are not dry in all parts 75 to 90 days in winter and spring.
Uracca soils have fragments that are mostly granite, gneiss and mica schist in the lower part.
Widtsoe soils are not adequately separated and should be reviewed for possible correlation.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Elevation: of 6,500 to 9,020 feet (1,981 to 2,749 m). 
Landform: mountain slopes and alluvial fans
Slope: 1 to 60 percent.
Parent material: colluvium, slope alluvium and alluvium weathered from basic and intermediate igneous rocks.
Climate: semiarid
Average annual precipitation: 12 to 16 inches (305 to 406 mm).
Mean annual temperature: is 39 to 45 degrees F (3.9 to 7.2 degrees C)
Frost-free period: 70 to 100 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ashuelot, Brownsto and Tridell soils. Ashuelot soils have a petrocalcic horizon. Brownsto soils lack a mollic epipedon and an argillic horizon. Tridell soils lack an argillic horizon. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderate permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: The soils are used for rangeland, woodland, and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is pinyon pine, Utah juniper, big sagebrush, blue grama and Indian ricegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming. MLRA 47, 48A. The series is moderately extensive, with 123,637 acres to date. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Panguitch Area, Garfield County, Utah, 1985. 

REMARKS: in the future the landform will be kept to alluvial fans.  The parent material will be alluvium. Ipson will not be used in Wyoming; and Colorado with sandstone parent material.
