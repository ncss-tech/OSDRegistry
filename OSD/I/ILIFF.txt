ILIFF SERIES


The Iliff series consists of moderately deep, well and moderately well drained soils that formed in medium and moderately fine textured loess materials high in carbonates and loess over cemented calcareous sandstone.  Iliff soils are on upland plains and have slopes of 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 41 centimeters (16 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C. (49 degrees F.) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Aridic Paleustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Iliff loam - grassland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

  A1--0 to 8 centimeters (0 to 3 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (5 to 15 centimeters (2 to 6 inches) thick)

  A2--8 to 15 centimeters (3 to 6 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; slightly hard, friable; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 10 centimeters (2 to 4 inches) thick)

  E--15 to 20 centimeters (6 to 8 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 8 centimeters (0 to 3 inches) thick)

  Bt--20 to 38 centimeters (8 to 15 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; strong medium and fine prismatic structure parting to strong medium and fine angular blocks; hard; firm; many continuous distinct clay films; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (10 to 30 centimeters (4 to 12 inches) thick)

  BCk--38 to 56 centimeters (15 to 22 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocks; hard, friable; few patchy distinct clay films; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (10 to 30 centimeters (4 to 12 inches) thick)

  Ck--56 to 74 centimeters (22 to 29 inches); light gray (2.5Y 7/2) silt loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline; smooth boundary. (10 to 41 centimeters (4 to 16 inches) thick)

  C--74 to 86 centimeters (29 to 34 inches); light gray (2.5Y 7/2) loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (8 to 30 centimeters (3 to 12 inches) thick)

  R--86 centimeters (34 inches); white (10YR 8/1) caliche sandstone of the Ogallala formation.
