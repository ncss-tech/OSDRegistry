IPANO SERIES

The Ipano series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or loess over residuum weathered from sandstone. These soils occure on hills, sedimentary plains, and uplands. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Ipano loam, cultivated. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

    Ap--0 to 8 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and very fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; very slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (7 to 10 inches thick)

    Bk1--8 to 13 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium and fine subangular blocky; hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; strongly effervescent; common fine soft masses of lime; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 8 inches thick)

    Bk2--13 to 19 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium and fine subangular blocky; hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine and very fine roots and pores; violently effervescent; common soft masses and filaments of lime; few angular sandstone fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 18 inches thick)

    2Bk3--19 to 24 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine and few medium pores; violently effervescent; common nodules of lime; 15 percent sandstone fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 18 inches thick)

    2BCk--24 to 34 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) channery loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); 30 percent sandstone fragments; gradual wavy boundary. 

    2R--34 to 36 inches; hard, fractured sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION: Cascade County, Montana; 460 feet west and 180 feet north of center of section 28, T.20N., R.3E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Mean annual soil temperature - 42 degrees to 47 degrees F. 
Thickness of the mollic epipedon - 7 to 10 inches 

Ap or A horizon
Hue - 10YR or 2.5Y
Value - 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma 2 or 3
Clay content - 15 to 27 percent
Rock fragments - 0 to 15 percent gravel or channers
pH - 7.4 to 8.4

Bk, 2Bk and 2BCk horizons
Hue - 10YR or 2.5Y
Texture - loam or silt loam
Clay content - 18 to 27 percent
Rock fragments - 15 to 35 percent gravel or channers
Calcium carbonate equivalent - 15 to 30 percent
Reaction - 7.4 to 8.4

Some pedons do not have a 2Bk or 2BCk horizon.

COMPETING SERIES: 
Beanlake (MT) - do not have a lithic contact
Kiev (MT) - do not have a lithic contact
Minnimaud (UT) - have a paralithic contact at a depth of 40 and 60 inches
Mudcree () - have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches
Osote (UT) - do not have a lithic contact
Roundor (MT) - have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches
Zahl (ND) - do not have a lithic contact

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform - hills, sedimentary plains and uplands
Elevation - 3,000 to 5,300 feet
Slope - 0 to 15 percent
Parent material - alluvium, or loess over residuum weathered from sandstone
Mean annual precipitation - 14 to 19 inches, most of which falls in spring or early summer.
Mean annual air temperature - 38 degrees to 45 degrees F., mean January temperature 8 degrees to 25 degrees F., and mean July temperature of 65 degrees to 70 degrees F.
Frost free period - 80 to 135 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Azaar, Castner, Sunburst and Ticell soils. Azaar soils are noncalcareous to depths of 10 to 15 inches. Castner and Ticell soils have bedrock at depths of less than 20 inches. Sunburst soils have ochric epipedons and do not have bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Ipano soils are used as rangeland. Native vegetation is needle-and-thread, blue grama, western wheatgrass, prairie junegrass and threadleaf sedge.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central and northern Montana. The series is of small extent.  MLRAs 44B and 46.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Cascade County, Montana, 1975.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and properties recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 8 inches (Ap)
Calcic horizon - the zone from 8 to 34 inches (Bk1, Bk2, 2Bk3, and 2BCk)
Lithic contact - at 34 inches (2R)

Ipano soils have an ustic moisture regime and a frigid temperature regime 

The 2013 update added range in characteristics for horizons based on NASIS data.  Color ranges and fragment types (and kinds) should be investigated and added to the RIC and typical pedon during an update project.  Ipano soils should also be investigated as to whether they truly have a lithologic discontinuity.
