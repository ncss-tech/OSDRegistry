IGOR SERIES

The Igor series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till derived from granite and gneiss.  These soils are on ground moraines and moraines.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 1 degree C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Pachic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Igor gravelly loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). Surface fragments include 20 percent subrounded stones and 10 percent subrounded boulders.

    A1--0 to 5 cm; very dark gray (7.5YR 3/1) gravelly loam, black (7.5YR 2.5/1) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 15 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary.

    A2--5 to 24 cm; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) very stony loam, very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 20 percent gravel, 12 percent cobbles and 20 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary. (combined thickness of the A1 and A2 horizons - 15 to 30 cm)

    Bt--24 to 70 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) extremely gravelly sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many fine tubular pores; 3 percent faint clay films on all faces of peds; 40 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles and 12 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear smooth boundary. (40 to 60 centimeters thick)

    BC--70 to 200 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; many fine tubular pores; 35 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).
