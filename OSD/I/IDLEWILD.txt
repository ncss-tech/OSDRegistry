IDLEWILD SERIES

The Idlewild series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. These soils are on terraces and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Aquic Argixerolls

TYPE LOCATION:  Washoe County, Nevada; about 1,700feet west and 400 feet south of the northeast corner of section 6, T. 19 N., R. 20 E.; USGS Reno 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 32 minutes 53 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 46 minutes 38 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.5480556 latitude, -119.7772222 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Soil moisture: Saturated at depths of 50 to 100 cm during a large part of the year. Xeric soil moisture regime bordering on aridic.
Mean annual soil temperature: 10 to 11 degrees C.
Depth to base of argillic: 76 to 100 cm.  

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 35 to 45 percent.

A horizons
Hue: 2.5Y or l0YR.
Value: 4 or 5 dry.

Bt horizons
Hue of 2.5Y or l0YR. 
Value: 4 or 5 moist. 
Chroma of 3 or 4.  
Texture: Clay, silty clay, clay loam, or heavy silty clay loam. 
Reaction: Slightly acid or neutral.

C horizons 
Texture: Sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, sandy clay loam, or clay. 
Redox concentrations: Few to many redox concentrations.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Idlewild soils are on alluvial fans and low terraces at elevations of 1,310 to 1,405 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  They have formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  The climate is semiarid with a mean annual precipitation of about 200 mm; mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C; and a frost-free season of about 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Fleischmann, Orr, Truckee, and Voltaire soils.  Fleischmann and Orr soils are well drained and lack mottles.  Truckee and Voltaire soils lack an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; slow runoff; slow permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Many of these areas have been artificially drained.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Pasture and urban development.  Vegetation is mostly meadow grass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Reno area of southwestern Washoe County.  The series is of small extent.
