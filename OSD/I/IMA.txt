IMA SERIES

The Ima series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium and eolian materials derived dominantly from sandstone and shale of the Jurassic, Triassic, and Permian ages.  These soils are on hillslopes, plains, alluvial fans, terraces, and piedmonts.  Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 381 mm (15 in) and the mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (60 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Ustic Haplocambids

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture:  An aridic moisture regime bordering on ustic.  The soil moisture control section is dry in some or all parts for more than 205 but less than 270 days, cumulative, in normal years. October through May are the driest months. These soils are intermittently moist June through September.

Mean annual soil temperature: 15 to 17 degrees C (59 to 62 degrees F).
Depth to secondary carbonates: 50 to 75 cm (20 to 30 in).
Solum thickness: less than 200 cm (80 in).
Particle-size control section: 10 to 18 percent silicate clay.  Clay content below the particle-size control section is variable, ranging from 15 to 35 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Chaparral (NM), Mallet (AZ) and Perilla (AZ) series.  Similar soils are the Los Tanos, and Malstrom series.
Chaparral soils: contain 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.
Mallet and Perilla soils: receive significant amounts of winter precipitation characteristic of the Sonoran Desert.  In addition, Mallet soils do not have calcium carbonate in the lower profile.
Los Tanos soils: have sandstone at 50 to 100 cm from the soil surface.
Malstrom soils: have a calcic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: alluvium and eolian deposits mostly from Jurassic, Triassic, Permian, and Pennsylvania age sandstones and shales.
Landform: hillslopes, plains, alluvial fans, terraces, and piedmonts.
Slopes: 0 to 10 percent.
Mean annual air temperature: 15 to 17 degrees C (57 to 62 degrees F).
Mean annual precipitation: 305 to 432 mm (12 to 17 in).
Frost-free period: 180 to 210 days.
Elevation: 1,220 to 1,620 meters (4,000 to 5,300 ft).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Los Tanos series and Armesa, Chispa, Dalby, Hodgins, La Lande, McCarran, Montoya, Quay, Redona, series.  Armesa, Chispa, and Quay soils have more than 18 percent clay content in the particle-size control section and have a calcic horizon within 100 cm.
Dalby and Montoya soils: have more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.
Hodgins, La Lande, and Redona soils: have more than 18 percent clay content in the particle-size control section.
McCarran soils: have a gypsic horizon within 100 cm of the soil surface.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Moderately rapid permeability.  Surface runoff is negligible on 0 to 3 percent slopes, very low on 3 to 5 percent slopes, and low on 5 to 10 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Principal use is for livestock grazing.  Climax native vegetation is mainly little bluestem, sideoats grama, needle-and-thread, feathergrass, black grama, western wheatgrass, blue grama, hairy grama, fringed sagewort, sand dropseed, spike dropseed, sand bluestem, yucca, and occasionally sand sage.  This series has been correlated to the Sandy Loam (R070B054NM) range site in MLRA-70B.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Upper Pecos River Valley (MLRA 70B in LRR G) in east-central New Mexico and western Texas.  The series is of moderate extent.
