INGRAM SERIES

The Ingram series consists of moderately deep, well drained,
slowly permeable soils that formed in basalt.  These upland soils have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, hyperthermic Torrertic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ingram stony clay--rangeland.
                (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A1--0 to 4 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) stony clay, dark brown
(10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky parting to moderate very fine and fine angular blocky structure; very hard, firm; many fine roots; 50 percent angular and subrounded basalt pebbles, cobbles and stones on surface, few imbedded; neutral;
clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 10 inches thick)

     A2--4 to 15 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) stony clay, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and medium angular blocky
structure; extremely hard, very firm; many fine roots; distinct pressure faces on some peds; 20 percent angular and subrounded
basalt fragments; neutral; gradual wavy boundary.  (7 to 15 inches thick)

     Bk1--15 to 23 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) stony clay, dark
brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine and medium angular blocky structure; extremely hard, very firm; common fine roots; distinct pressure faces on some peds; about 25 percent by volume of angular and subrounded basalt fragments; few soft bodies of calcium carbonate; calcareous, moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.  (5 to 15 inches thick)

     Bk2--23 to 29 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) stony clay, dark
brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist, with about 25 percent by volume of
yellowish red (5YR 5/6) clay; weak fine and medium blocky
structure; very hard, very firm; few fine roots; about 25 percent
by volume of angular and subrounded basalt fragments; few soft
bodies of calcium carbonate; calcareous, moderately alkaline;
gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick)

     Bk3--29 to 38 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) stony clay, dark
brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine blocky structure; very hard,
very firm; about 25 percent by volume of angular and subrounded basalt fragments; about 5 percent by volume of soft bodies of
calcium carbonate; calcareous, moderately alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 15 inches thick)

     R--38 to 60 inches; indurated basalt; coarsely fractured.

TYPE LOCATION:  Uvalde County, Texas; 8.8 miles west of courthouse
in Uvalde, in a pasture 400 yards south of U.S. Highway 90.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches and corresponds to the depth to indurated basalt or a bed
of basalt rubble.  Coarse fragments ranging in size from pebbles
to boulders comprise 15 to 35 percent of the soil.  Stones and boulders on the soil surface range from 15 to 70 percent within a horizontal distance of a few feet.  The soil is clayey throughout.  Clay content ranges from 45 to 60 percent.  The dry soil cracks
from 0.5 to 2.0 inches wide to depths of 20 inches or more.

The A horizon is dark brown (7.5YR 3/2; 10YR 3/3), brown (7.5YR
4/2; 10YR 4/3), reddish brown (5YR 4/3), dark reddish brown (5YR
3/2; 3/3), or very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2).  Reaction of the
A horizon ranges from neutral to mildly alkaline.

The Bk horizon is reddish brown (5YR 5/3, 4/3, 5/4, 4/4), dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3, 3/4), or brown (7.5YR 5/4, 4/4).  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline and calcareous.  Bodies of calcium carbonate range from few to 10 percent by volume in the B horizon.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 2 to about 15 percent.

A C horizon, 3 to 8 inches thick, of basalt fragments and reddish brown clay is in some pedons.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing soils in the same
family.  Similar soils are Dant, Knippa, and Raymondville series, none of which are underlain by basalt or have a lithic contact.
Dant soils have fine-loamy control sections.  Knippa soils have calcic horizons.  Raymondville soils have colors in hue of 10YR in all horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ingram soils occupy isolated hills and
ridges.  They are formed in clays weathered from basalt and
phonolite on igneous plugs.  Slopes are mostly 10 to 20 percent,
but range from 0 to 30 percent.  The climate is warm semiarid.  Average annual rainfall is 20 to 27 inches, and the Thornthwaite
P-E index is 22 to 40.  At the type location the mean annual temperature is about 70 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are soils in the
surrounding limestone and outwash plains, and include the
competing Knippa series, as well as Montell, Olmos, and Uvalde series.  Montell soils have intersecting slickensides.  Olmos
soils have petrocalcic horizons.  Uvalde soils are deep and
contain less than 35 percent silicate clay in the control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; rapid runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for rangeland.  Most areas have a sparse ground cover of short grasses, and a thick overstory of thorny
brush including guajillo, guayacan, white brush, spiny hackberry, blackbrush, and pricklypear.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern part of Rio Grande Plain, Texas.  The soil is of small extent.
