ISOLATION SERIES

The Isolation series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in till derived from granitic rocks, gneiss and schist.  Isolation soils are on moraines.  Slopes range from 5 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Alfic Argiustolls

COMPETING SERIES:  There are presently no competing series.  When reclassified the following series may be competitors:  the Cosey and Harpole series.
Cosey and Harpole series average more than 20 percent clay in the control section and less than 15 percent mica (by grain count).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  till derived from granitic rocks, gneiss, and schist
Landform:  moraines
Slopes:  5 to 35 percent
Elevation:  8,000 to 9,000 feet
Mean annual temperature:  40 to 44 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation:  16 to 22 inches
Precipitation pattern:  Wettest months:  March, April, and May
    Driest months:  September and October
Frost-free period:  70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Nanita and Rofork soils.  Nanita soils have thin surface layers and are on north facing slopes.  Rofork soils have bedrock at depths of less than 20 inches and are in areas where till is a thin mantle over granitic rocks.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained, medium to very high runoff, and moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Recreation and wildlife. The present vegetation is  moderate to dense stands of ponderosa pine with an understory of mountain muhly, sedges, bluegrass, currant, Parry oatgrass, Griffiths wheatgrass, and needleandthread.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mountains of the north central Rocky Mountains, Colorado; LRR E, MLRA 48A; this series is of small extent.
