INDIAN CREEK SERIES

The Indian Creek series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks.  Indian Creek soils are on high stream terraces and dissected fan remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Buffaran, Lud, Midraw, and Norfork series.

Buffaran soils have duripans more than 100 cm thick.  Lud, Midraw, and Norfork soils have lithic contacts within 100 cm of the soil surface.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Indian Creek soils are on high stream terraces and dissected fan remnants. They typically occur on summit positions. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,375 to 1,830 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Borda, Cassiro, and Reno soils. Borda soils are deep and do not have duripans.  Cassiro soils are deep, clayey-skeletal, have mollic epipedons, and do not have duripans.  Reno soils are moderately deep to duripans.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; very high surface runoff; low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Indian Creek soils are used for livestock grazing, recreation, urban development, and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is low sagebrush, cheatgrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, Sandberg's bluegrass, and milkvetch.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada and northeastern California.  These soils are moderately extensive.  The series concept and main acreage is in MLRA 26, while other acreage occurs in MLRA 23.
