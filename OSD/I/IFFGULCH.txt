IFFGULCH SERIES 

The Iffgulch series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in alluvium from glaciolacustrine deposits. These soils are in swales and ephemeral drainages which disect stream terraces in glaciolacustrine landforms.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, frigid Typic Endoaquolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Iffgulch clay, forested (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 2 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2)  clay, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; strong fine and medium granular structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (1 to 4 inches thick) 

    Bg1--2 to 10 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium subangular blocky; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 12 inches thick) 

    Bg2--10 to 24 inches; gray (5Y 5/1) silty clay, gray (5Y 6/1) dry; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium subangular blocky; very hard, very firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots; few fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redox concentrations; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 18 inches thick) 

    Bg3--24 to 33 inches; gray (5Y 6/1) silty clay, light gray (5Y 7/1) dry; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium subangular blocky; very hard, very firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots; few fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redox concentrations; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 12 inches thick) 

    Cg1--33 to 46 inches; gray (5Y 6/1) clay loam, light gray (5Y 7/1) dry; massive; very hard, very firm, sticky and plastic; few fine and medium roots; common fine and medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redox concentrations, many fine and medium distinct greenish gray (5G 6/1) redox depletions; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 16 inches thick) 

    Cg2--46 to 60 inches; gray (5Y 6/1) gravelly clay loam, light gray (5Y 7/1) dry; massive; very hard, very firm, sticky and plastic; few fine and medium roots; common fine and medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redox concentrations, many fine and medium distinct greenish gray (5G 6/1) redox depletions; 15 percent pebbles, 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0).

USE AND VEGETATION: Iffgulch soils are used mainly for woodland, understory grazing, and wildlife habitat. Potential native vegetation is mainly quaking aspen, black cottonwood, lodgepole pine, and Douglas fir. Understory vegetation is mainly black hawthorn, Douglas spirea, thinleaf alder, common snowberry, potentilla species, carex species, equisetum species, cow parsnip, false hellebore, coolwort foamflower, ladyfern, western swordfern, and other forbs, shrubs, and grasses. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Iffgulch soils are of small extent in the valleys of northwestern Montana.

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretation Record:  MT1514.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 10 inches (A, Bg1 horizons); gleyed horizons with redox features (Bg2, Bg3, Cg1, and Cg2 horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches.  Iffgulch soils have a frigid temperature regime and an aquic moisture regime.
