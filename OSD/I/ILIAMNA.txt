COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this classification.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Depth class: very deep
Drainage class: well drained
Parent material: ash influenced loess over glaciofluvial deposits
Landform: outwash plains, nunataks
Slopes: 0 to 45 percent
Mean annual temperature: 33 to 36 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 25 to 35 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Whitsol and Tuxendi soils. Whitsol soil have less than 6 percent total carbon in the spodic horizon and occur on similar landforms. Tuxendi soils are somewhat poorly drained and occur on discharge slopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, low to high runoff, saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the solum and moderately high to high in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for Wildlife habitat and recreation. The native vegetation is Lutz spruce, paper birch, alder, grasses, and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 224 Cook Inlet Lowlands, South-Central Alaska, The series is of small extent.
