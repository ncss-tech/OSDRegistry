INMO SERIES

The Inmo series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granitic, volcanic, and metamorphic rocks. Inmo soils are on alluvial fans, inset fans, fan skirts, fan piedmonts, beach plains, and in drainageways. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Sandy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Inmo gravelly sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered with 20 percent gravel.

    A--0 to 20 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium and thick platy structure;  soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine vesicular and common fine interstitial pores; 15 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 33 cm thick)

    C1--20 to 38 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly loamy coarse sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 35 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 23 cm thick)

    C2--38 to 102 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly coarse sand, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; many fine interstitial pores; 55 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (50 to 90 cm thick)

    C3--102 to 152 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly loamy coarse sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 50 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Churchill County, Nevada; about 33 miles southeast of Fallon and 7 miles south of U.S. Highway 50 in Fairview Valley; 1,200 feet south and 1,400 feet east of the projected northwest corner of section 18, T. 15 N., R. 33 E.; USGS Chukar Canyon 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 9 minutes 59 seconds N and longitude 118 degrees 18 minutes 0 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.1665000 latitude, -118.300000 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist for short periods in winter and spring, dry from summer to mid-fall; typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 15 degrees C.

Particle-size control section - Rock fragments: 50 to 75 percent gravel, over half of which are fine (2 to 5 mm in diameter). Lithology of fragments is dominantly of igneous or metamorphic origin. Common rock types are granite, rhyolite, and gneiss.

A horizon

Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.
Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

C horizons
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y.
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist.
Chroma: 2 through 4, dry or moist.
Texture (less than 2 mm fraction): Stratified coarse sand, sand, loamy coarse sand, and loamy sand.
Consistence: Soft or slightly hard dry, very friable or friable moist, or is loose.
Reaction: Moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.
Salinity (EC): 2 to 4 mmhos/cm.
Sodicity (SAR): 1 to 12.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bluewing, Gynelle, Ioka, Itme, Izamatch, Izo, Leo, Nepalto, Wardenot, and Willwood series. 

Bluewing soils have a Bk horizon above a depth of 100 cm, have over 50 percent coarse gravel (between 20 and 32 mm in diameter), and have as much as 25 percent cobbles and stones. Gynelle and Izo soils have mostly gravel larger than 13 millimeters in diameter. Gynelle soils also have Bk horizons. Ioka soils have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 9 degrees C.  Itme and Izamatch soils are moist in some part of the moisture control section for 10 to 20 days (cumulative) between July and October. Leo soils have strata of sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the control section and have gravel that range up to about 50 millimeters in diameter. Nepalto soils are not stratified and have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR. Wardenot soils contain silica coatings and pendants on rock fragments in a Cqk horizon and have a strata of fine sandy loam in the control section. Willwood soils have mean annual soil temperature of 9 to 10 degrees C, have less than 50 percent coarse and very coarse sands, and are not moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Inmo soils are on alluvial fans, inset fans, fan skirts, fan piedmonts, beach plains, and in drainageways. They formed in alluvium derived from granitic, volcanic, and metamorphic rocks. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,190 to 1,650 meters. The climate is cool-arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 110 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Isolde soil and the competing Bluewing soil. Isolde soils are sandy, formed in eolian sand, and occur on dunes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Excessively drained; very low or low surface runoff; very high saturated hydraulic conductivity. These soils are nonflooded through frequently flooded.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Inmo soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is mainly shadscale, Bailey greasewood, bud sagebrush, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada. These soils are not extensive.  MLRAs 27 and 29.
