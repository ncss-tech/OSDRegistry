ISLAMORADA SERIES

The Islamorada Series consists of very poorly drained soils that are moderately deep to rippable coral or oolitic limestone.  Islamorada soils formed in sapric organic material.  They are on tidal areas of the Florida Keys.  Slopes are less than 1 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Euic, isohyperthermic Lithic Haplosaprists

TYPICAL PEDON:  Islamorada muck from a tidal area dominated by red mangroves.

     Oa1--0 to 5 inches; black (5YR 2/1) rubbed and unrubbed muck; about, 15 percent unrubbed fiber content, less than 5 percent rubbed; massive; nonsticky; about 40 percent by volume of fine and medium live roots; neutral; clear smooth boundary.

     Oa2--5 to 35 inches; very dark gray (5YR 3/1) rubbed and unrubbed muck; about 35 percent unrubbed fiber content, less than 10 percent rubbed; massive; nonsticky; about 30 percent by volume of fine and medium live roots; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.  (the Oa horizon is 20 to 50 inches thick).

     2R--35 inches; soft to hard but rippable coral limestone.

TYPE LOCATION:  Monroe County, Florida; Lower Matecumbe Key; 1 mile SE of Lignum Vitae Channel and 200 feet NW of U. S. Hwy. 1; SE 1/4, NE 1/4, Sec. 15, T. 64 S., R. 36 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 50 inches.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.

     The Oa horizon has hue of 5YR to 10 YR, value of 2 or 3,  and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is muck with a rubbed fiber content of less than 15 percent and an unrubbed fiber content of 15 to 35 percent.

     The 2R horizon is soft to hard but rippable coral or oolitic limestone.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no series in the same family.  Competing series in similar families include the Tavernier and Keylargo Series.  Tavernier soils are shallow to limestone bedrock.  Keylargo soils are deeper to limestone bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Islamorada soils are on mangrove swamps subject to daily flooding by tides.  Elevations are dominantly at or below 1929 NGVD.  The mean annual temperature is about 75 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing
organic Keylargo and Tavernier soils on similar landforms; the poorly drained marly Cudjoe, Lignumvitae, and Keywest soils on slightly higher landforms; and the moderately well
drained organic  Matecumbe and the somewhat poorly drained marly Saddlebunch soils on significantly higher upland landforms.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  These soils are very poorly drained with a highwater table at or near the surface much of the year.  Permeability is moderately rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of the soil are used as wildlife habitat.  The dominate vegetation is black and red mangroves.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Approximately 6000 acres of Islamorada soils are on the Florida Keys.  These soils may occur on other tropical islands.
