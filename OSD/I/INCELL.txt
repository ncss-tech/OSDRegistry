INCELL SERIES

The Incell series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium of Quaternary age.  These soils are in depressions of the South Texas Coastal Plain.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 23 degrees C (73 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 690 mm (27 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, hyperthermic Cumulic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Incell clay--in a nearly level depression with less than 1 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 4 m (13 feet). (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 in); black (10YR 2/1) clay, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry, weak fine blocky structure; hard, firm; many fine roots; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. 

    A2--15 to 64 cm (6 to 25 in); black (10YR 2/1) clay, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry, weak fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm; few fine roots; few fine faint 5Y 5/6 iron concentrations; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. {combined thickness of the A horizons is 36 to 91 cm (14 to 36 in)}

    Bkg--64 to 152 cm (25 to 60 in); grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) sandy clay loam, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; many fine distinct light olive brown2.5Y 5/6 iron concentrations; few fine nodules of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the Bkg and BCk horizons is 41 to 102 cm [16 to 40 in])

    BCk--152 to 203 cm (60 to 80 in); light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) sandy clay loam, light gray (2.5Y 7/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, common fine and medium prominent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) and brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) iron concentrations; few fine and medium iron-manganese masses; few fine nodules of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Willacy County, Texas; from the intersection of U.S. Highway 77 and Texas Highway 186 in Raymondville; 14 miles east on Texas Highway 186 to the intersection with Farm Road 497; 4 miles east on Farm Road 497; 500 feet north of road in center of a depression in rangeland. Willamar, Texas USGS topographic quadrangle; Latitude: 26 degrees, 29 minutes, 46.7 seconds N; Longitude: 97 degrees, 32 minutes, 30.2 seconds W; NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil Moisture: These soils are saturated or covered with water most of the year. The permanent water table is at or near the soil surface. During periods of extreme drought they are dry in the upper 30 cm (12 in).
Particle-size control section (weighted average):
Clay content: 25 to 35 percent

A horizon
Hue: 10YR
Value: 2 to 4
Chroma: 1
Texture: clay or sandy clay
Reaction: slightly acid or neutral
EC(dS/m): 0 to 4
SAR: 0 to 6 

B horizon 
Hue: 10YR to 5Y
Value: 3 to 6
Chroma: 1 to 3 
Texture: sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam
Redox concentrations: Iron concentrations or depletions are amount- few to many, size- fine to coarse, and contrast- distinct or prominent. 
Reaction: slightly or moderately alkaline in the upper part and moderately or strongly alkaline in the lower part.
EC(dS/m): 0 to 2
SAR: 0 to 10

BC horizon
Hue: 2.5Y or 5Y
Value: 4 to 7
Chroma: 1 to 4
Texture: fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam
Redox concentrations: amount- few to many, size- fine to coarse, and contrast- distinct or prominent.
Reaction: moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.
EC(dS/m): 0 to 2
SAR: 0 to 15

Some pedons are calcareous throughout and contain a few calcium carbonate concretions.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same family.  Similar soils include Balmorhea (TX), Edroy (TX), Jarron (TX), Realitos (TX), Rio (TX), and Tiocano (TX) series.
Balmorhea soils: have a fine-silty family and a thermic temperature regime
Edroy, Realitos, and Tiocano soils: are in a fine family and are Vertisols
Rio soils: have an argillic horizon
Jarron soils: have a natric horizon

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loamy alluvium of Quaternary age
Landform: depressions
Slope: 0 to 1 percent
Mean annual air temperature: 22 to 23 degrees C (72 to 74 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 635 to 711 mm (25 to 28 in)
Frost-free period: 319 to 341 days
Elevation: 3 to 11 m (10 to 35 ft)
Thornthwaite P-E Index: 31 to 36

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Latina, Lyford, Nueces, Porfirio, Saucel, Sauz, and Willamar series.  All these soils occur at slightly higher landscapes and are dry in the moisture control section for longer periods.
Latina, Porfirio, and Saucel soils: are calcareous to the surface.
Lyford and Nueces soils: have an argillic horizon.
Sauz and Willamar soils: have a natric horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained.  Runoff is negligible.  Very slow permeability.  Surfaces are ponded or saturated most of the year.  Rare flooding occurs from storm surge resulting from cyclonic storms.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation includes marsh hay cordgrass, Hartwigs Paspalum, cattail, sedges and forbs.  The ecological site is Fresh Marsh, PE 31 to 36 (R083DY712TX).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Lower Rio Grande Plain (MLRA 83D in LRR I) of southern Texas.  The series is of small extent.
