IRENE SERIES

The Irene series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in silty calcareous alluvium of late Pleistocene to Holocene age. These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on stream terraces and stream terrace remnants.  Slope range is 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm (21 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).
