IWELA SERIES

The Iwela series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Iwela soils are on footslopes and backslopes of stable landslides. Permeability is moderate in the subsoil and rapid in the lower substratum. Slopes are 10 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haplustalfs

All these soils lack a skeletal discontinuity within 40 inches.  Augustine, Flugle, Parkelei and Pinitos series have more than 35 percent sand in the particle-size control section.  Bigbow soils have buried paleosol horizons.  Carri, Celavar, Celacy, Evpark, Nyjack and Ribera soils have a lithic or paralithic contact within 40 inch depths. Dermala soils have igneous or metamorphic parent material. Lykorly soils have annual soil temperature of 54 to 56 degrees F.  The Arwite, Bigbow, Dalhart, Deekay, Elwop, Fort Collins, Gateson, Oldwolf, Olnest, Rauzi, Rockybutte, Stoneham, Toluca, and Wagonhound soils are in LRR-E or LRR-G soils and are more moist in May and June.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Iwela soils are on footslopes and backslopes of stable landslides. They formed in colluvium derived from Tertiary sandstone and Cretaceous shale. Slopes are 10 to 40 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,800 to 7,800 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches with about half falling as winter snow and half falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 120 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Nomrah soil and the Vosburg soil. Nomrah soils lack skeletal substrata, and have calcic horizons. Vosburg soils have thick mollic epipedons and occur on adjacent toeslopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; permeability is moderate in the subsoil and rapid in the lower substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: Iwela soils are used for livestock grazing and fuelwood production. Present vegetation is pinyon, Utah juniper, pingue, Wyoming big sagebrush, muttongrass, and blue grama.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Iwela soils are of moderate extent below the Defiance Uplift-Chuska Mountains portion of the Colorado Plateau province in northwest New Mexico. MLRAs 35 & 36.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 3 inches. (A horizon)

Argillic horizon - The zone from 3 inches to a depth of about 44 inches.  (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and 2Btk horizons)

Skeletal substrata - The presence of horizons with greater than 35 percent rock fragments from 26 inches to a depth of about 64 inches.  (2Btk and 2BCk horizons)
