IMMOKALEE SERIES

The Immokalee series consists of very deep, very poorly and poorly drained soils that formed in sandy marine sediments. Immokalee soils are on flatwoods and low broad flats on marine terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1397 millimeters (55 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, siliceous, hyperthermic Arenic Alaquods

Depressional phases are ponded 0 to 30 centimeters (0 to 12 inches) for 6 to 9 months each year.

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Under natural conditions Immokalee soils are used for water quality, forestry, and wildlife habitat. Large areas with adequate water management are used for citrus, truck crops, pastureland, and range. 
Potential native vegetation consists of longleaf and slash pine with an undergrowth of sawpalmetto, gallberry, waxmyrtle and pineland threeawn. In depressions, water tolerant plants such as cypress, loblollybay gorodonia, red maple, sweetbay, maidencane, blue maidencane, chalky bluestem, sand cordgrass and bluejoint panicum are more common.
