IVER SERIES

The Iver series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess over residual material and colluvium derived from quartz, sandstone, shale and quartzite.  Iver soils are on side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Iver silt loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 10 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel and 1 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 cm thick)

    A2--10 to 30 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots, common fine and medium roots; many fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (20 to 50 cm thick)

    AB--30 to 50 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots; common fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (15 to 30 cm thick)

    2Bw1--50 to 79 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3); moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 38 cm thick)

    2Bw2--79 to 152 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very cobbly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel and 35 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Pershing County, Nevada; in the East Range, about 2,200 feet east and 2,000 feet south of the northwest corner of section 22, T.  31 N., R. 36.; USGS Inskip Canyon 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 32 minutes 45 seconds N and longitude 117 degrees 55  minutes 12 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.5458333 latitude, -117.9200000 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist in winter through early summer, dry from July to November; typic xeric soil moisture regime.  Mean annual soil temperature: 6 to 8 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 50 to 100 cm thick.
Depth to lithologic discontinuity: 69 to 97 cm.
Reaction: Slightly acid or neutral.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 15 to 18 percent.
Rock fragments:  Averages 15 to 35 percent, mostly gravel and cobbles.  Cobbles dominate in some subhorizons.

A horizons
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.

Bw1 horizon
Value:  4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4.
Texture: Gravelly silt loam or gravelly loam. 
Structure:  Subangular blocky with subhorizons of some pedons that are massive.

Bw2 horizon
Texture: Very gravelly loam, very cobbly loam or very cobbly very fine sandy loam and averages very cobbly loam or very cobbly very fine sandy loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cinderspring, Kabear, Lobert, Ola, Prucree, Redmount, Shively, Suryon, Taterpa and Wagore series. 

Cinderspring soils have cinders in the particle-size control section. Kabear Lobert Taterpa soils have less than 15 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Ola, Prucree, Shively and Stripe soils are moderately deep.  Redmount soils lack a cambic horizon and have a very gravelly sandy loam 2C horizon. Suryon soils lack a lithologic discontinuity with more than 35 percent rock fragments.  Wagore soils contain 20 to 35 percent rock fragments which are comprised of 50 percent 2 to 5 mm diameter gravel.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Iver soils are on side slopes of mountains.  These soils formed in loess over residual material and colluvium derived from quartz grit, sandstone, shale, and quartzite.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 1,680 to 2,445 meters.  The climate is semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Golsum, Gosumi, Nomara, and Pernty series.  These soils have argillic horizons.  Golsum, Gosumi, and Pernty soils also have mollic epipedons less than 50 cm thick.  Golsum soils are 50 to 100 cm deep to a paralithic contact. Nomara soils are 50 to 100 cm deep to a lithic contact.  Pernty soils are less than 50 cm deep to a lithic contact.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained, rapid or very rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, rabbitbrush, Idaho fescue, Sandberg bluegrass, lupine and Eriogonum.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive. MLRA 24.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  BLM Sonoma Planning Unit, Humboldt and Pershing Counties, Nevada, 1974.

REMARKS:  Iver soils type location was moved from Humboldt County to Pershing County in 1992 to better represent the series concept.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 94 cm (A1, A2, AB and 2Bw1 horizons).
Lithologic discontinuity - The depth at 79 cm (The 2Bw2 horizon).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (AB, 2Bw1 and part of the A2 and 2Bw2 horizons).
