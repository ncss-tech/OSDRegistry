IFTEEN SERIES


The Ifteen series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone. Ifteen soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, carbonatic, thermic Durinodic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Ifteen extremely gravelly very fine sandy loam, rangeland and wildlife habitat. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered by approximately 65 percent pebbles, of which over one-half is pan fragments. 

	A--0 to 2 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely gravelly very fine sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; strong very thick and medium platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, common fine, medium and few coarse vesicular pores; 65 percent pebbles, of which over one-half are pan fragments; strongly effervescent (16 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the fine earth fraction); moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick) 

	Bw1--2 to 6 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate thick platy structure parting to medium subangular blocky; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common very fine and few fine tubular and interstitial pores; violently effervescent (20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the fine earth fraction); very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2); clear wavy boundary. 

	Bw2--6 to 15 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine, medium and coarse roots; common very fine and few fine tubular and interstitial pores; 5 percent pebbles; violently effervescent (20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the fine earth fraction); strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary. (The combined thickness of the Bw horizons is 9 to 18 inches.) 

	Bk--15 to 36 inches; pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine interstitial pores; disseminated calcium carbonate through out; 10 percent pebbles; violently effervescent (50 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the fine earth fraction); strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear wavy boundary. (14 to 24 inches thick) 

	2Bqk--36 to 60 inches; pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) extremely gravelly fine sandy loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; 80 percent discontinuous bands of strongly cementated silica and calcium carbonate; 70 percent pebbles and 5 percent cobbles; violently effervescent (25 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the fine earth fraction); strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

Bw horizons  Hue: 10YR or 7.5 YR.
Value: 6 or 7 dry.
Chroma: 4 through 6 dry and moist. 
Clay content: 8 to 16 percent. 
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent pebbles.
Structure: subangular blocky or platy parting to subangular blocky.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. Similar series are Kurstan (NV) soils. Kurstan soils have mixed mineralogy and contain 15 to 35 percent rock fragments. Depth to calcic horizon range from 5 to 14 inches and lack extremely gravelly substratum. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ifteen soils are on fan remnants. These soils formed in alluvium derived from limestone. Slope ranges from 2 to 30 percent. Elevations are 2,000 to 3,400 feet. The climate is hot and arid with warm, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 7 inches; mean annual air temperature is 57 to 63 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 180 to 240 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Weiser and Wechech series. Weiser and Wechech soils have loamy-skeletal control sections. Wechech soils are shallow to a petrocalcic horizon. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly creosotebush, white bursage and winterfat. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southern Nevada. MLRA 30. These soils are not extensive.
