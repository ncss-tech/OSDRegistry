IRELAND SERIES

The Ireland series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium, colluvium, and residuum from limestone, dolomite, and sandstone that have been influenced by loess. Ireland soils are found on slopes of 8 to 70 percent on mountain slopes, hillslopes, and ridges. The mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C., and the mean annual precipitation is about 450 mm.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Ireland very gravelly silt loam, rangeland. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 A--0 to 20 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, few fine, and medium roots; few very fine tubular and common very fine irregular pores; 25 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt wavy boundary

 ABk--20 to 41 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely cobbly silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine, medium, and coarse roots; common very fine tubular and irregular pores; 10 percent gravel and 60 percent cobbles; common distinct calcium carbonate coats on bottom surfaces of rock fragments; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary

 Bk--41 to 71 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely cobbly silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine, medium, and coarse roots; common very fine irregular pores; 10 percent gravel and 60 percent cobbles; common distinct calcium carbonate coats on bottom surfaces of rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); abrupt wavy boundary

 R--71 cm; fractured limestone; many distinct carbonate coats on bedrock; soil material in fractures
