GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: Coastal Plain
Landform: Broad uplands, slight depressions, and adjacent to alluvial terraces
Elevation: 10 to 100 feet
Parent Material: Stratified loamy alluvial and marine sediments
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 52 to 58 degrees F.
Mean Annual Precipitation: 42 to 48 inches
Frost Free Period: 190 to 210 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Downer soils--do not have a seasonal high water table above 72 inches, on slightly higher landforms
Fort Mott soils--have sandy surface layers more than 20 inches thick, on slightly higher landforms
Galestown soils--have a sandy subsoil, on higher landforms
Klej soils--somewhat poorly drained and have a sandy subsoil, on lower-lying landforms
Woodstown soils--moderately well drained with a fine-loamy particle-size control section, on lower-lying landforms

USE: Most areas are cleared and used for growing corn, barley, wheat, and soybeans. Some areas are irrigated.

VEGETATION: Wooded areas have an overstory of white oak, black oak, and scarlet oak. Some areas have Virginia pine and loblolly pine mixed with the oaks. Common understory species are sassafras, dogwood, greenbriar, American holly, and lowbush blueberry.

DISTRIBUTION: Coastal Plain of Maryland and Delaware

EXTENT: Moderate

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Dorchester County, Maryland, 1992

REMARKS: This soil was formerly included in the Sassafras series. Laboratory data indicate a base saturation (by sum of cations) greater than 35 percent, in cropped areas, and a base saturation of less than 35 percent on wooded areas. The high base status in this soil is thought to be the result of long-time cropping practices (liming). The soil would revert to a lower base saturation if the cropland areas were converted back to woodland.

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 15 inches (Ap and E horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 15 to 43 inches (Bt and BC horizons)
Aquic conditions--the zone from 48 inches to a depth of 80 inches is periodically saturated (endosaturation)
