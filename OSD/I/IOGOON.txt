IOGOON SERIES

The Iogoon series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks.  Iogoon soils are on canyon floors and flood plains.  Slopes are 2 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Oxyaquic Torrifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Iogoon fine sandy loam, on a south facing, linear to concave, 3 percent  slope in boxelder, basin big sagebrush, willow and squawbush at an elevation of 5,600 feet..  (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

Surface rock fragments are 5 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles.

    A--0 to 5 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine and very fine subangular blocky; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, few fine and medium roots; many very fine, few fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; 3 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; calcium carbonate is disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 9 inches thick)

    C1--5 to 11 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) gravelly fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine and very fine subangular blocky; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, few fine and medium roots; many very fine, few fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent; 6 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; calcium carbonate is disseminated; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 18 inches thick)

    C2--11 to 32 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) extremely cobbly fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine and very fine subangular blocky; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, few fine and medium roots; many very fine, common fine, few medium tubular and interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; slightly effervescent; 8 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; calcium carbonate is disseminated; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (21 to 45 inches thick)

    C3--32 to 47 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) fine sandy loam with stratified thin lenses of sandy loam to loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots; common very fine, few fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; calcium carbonate is disseminated; common fine and medium prominent reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8) redoximorphic concentrations; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 15 inches thick)

    C4--47 to 60 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) gravelly fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots; common very fine, few fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent; 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; calcium carbonate is disseminated; few fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) redoximorphic concentrations; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  Uintah County - Utah; 3 miles south of Jones Hole Fish Hatchery along Jones Hole Creek; 1,700 feet north and 1,800 feet west of the southeast corner of Sec. 13, T. 3 S., R. 25 E., SLBM; 40 degrees, 33 minutes, 21 seconds north latitude and 109 degrees, 3 minutes, 27 seconds west longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture regime: aridic bordering on ustic
Mean annual soil temperature: 47 to 51 degrees F.
Particle size control section: 5 to 13 percent clay and 35 to 80 percent rock fragments   Reaction: moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 10 percent
Depth to endosaturation:  3 to 5 feet during the months of April to October

A horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 5 or 6 dry, and 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent
The combination of depths and colors does not meet mollic criteria.

C horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 5 or 6 dry, and 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 3 or 4
Textures: typically are fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, and sandy loam modified by 35 to 80 percent gravel or cobbles.  Some pedons have stratified thin lenses of loam, silt loam, and silty clay loam

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Iogoon soils
Parent material:  alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks
Landform: canyon floors and flood plains that are subject to rare flooding
Slopes: 2 to 5 percent
Elevation: 5,000 to 5,600 feet
Mean annual air temperature: 44 to 49 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 8 to 12 inches
Freeze-free period: 110 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Labyrinth  and Chilton  soils.  Labyrinth soils have a sandy particle size control section.  Chilton soils are dryer and are located on stream terraces and alluvial fans.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  moderately well drained; very low runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally for wildlife and recreation.  Potential vegetation consists of boxelder, basin big sagebrush, willows, and squawbush.  This soil has been correlated to the Semiwet Fresh Streambank (Fremont Cottonwood) - 034XY018UT at the type location in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Utah.  The series is not extensive.  The name is coined from an Indian landmark term.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Uintah County (Dinosaur National Monument Soil Survey) Utah, 1997.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 5 inches (A horizon).
Ustic feature - in addition to the annual precipitation there is run off from canyon side slopes and fluctuating water tables to make the moisture control section moist in some part for at least 50 percent of the time the soil temperature is higher than 41 degrees F.
Fluventic feature - an irregular decrease in organic-carbon content from a depth of 10 inches to a depth of 40 inches.
