IGDELL SERIES

The Igdell series consists of moderately deep to a indurated duripan, well drained soils that formed in a thin loess cap over alluvium derived mainly from mixed rocks. Igdell soils are on fan piedmont remnants and plateau summits.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Abruptic Argiduridic Durixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Igdell gravelly silt loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is partially covered with 30 percent gravel.

    2Bt3--58 to 69 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of ped and lining pores; 15 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to 15 cm thick)

    2Bqkm--69 to 102 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) indurated duripan, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist; massive; extremely hard, extremely firm; continuous alternate bands of 1/2 to 2 mm thick silica laminae; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2)

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  Averages 45 to 60 percent.
Rock fragments:  10 to 35 percent, mainly gravel.

A and AB horizons
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Reaction:  Neutral or slightly alkaline.

2Bt horizon

Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  3 through 6.
Texture:  Clay, gravelly clay or silty clay in the upper part, the lower part contain subhorizon with textures of gravelly loam, gravelly clay loam or very gravelly sandy clay loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Insidert series.  The Insidert soils have carbonates at 30 to 50 cm and bedrock within 100 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Igdell soils are on fan piedmont remnants and plateau summits.  These soils formed in a thin loess cap over alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 1,770 to 2.260 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Eboda, Gance and Stampede series.  Eboda soils are moderately deep to soft bedrock and have 25 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Gance soils have ochric epipedons, 35 to 75 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and do not have a duripan.  The Stampede soils lack an abrupt textural increase in clay and Bt subhorizons with 60 to 70 percent clay.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly low sagebrush, Douglas rabbitbrush, phlox, Idaho fescue, Sandberg bluegrass and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Nevada.  MLRA 25.  Igdell soils are not extensive.
