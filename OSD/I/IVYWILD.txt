IVYWILD SERIES

The Ivywild series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium, slope alluvium, or glacial till derived from granitic and metamorphic rocks.  Ivywild soils are on mountain slopes and ridges and have slopes of 5 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, micaceous Ustic Dystrocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ivywild bouldery sandy loam on a northwest-facing, 56 percent slope in coniferous forest at an elevation of 10,550 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise indicated.) Described on August 1, 1982.

     Oi--0 to 1 inch; slightly decomposed needles, leaves, and twigs.

     A--1 to 2 inch; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) bouldery sandy loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 2 percent boulders, few stones, 25 percent gravel; many fine and common roots; many fine interstitial pores, very strongly acid (pH 4.6) clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 2 inches thick)

     E--2 to 6 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure;  very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 55 percent fine gravel; many fine and very fine roots; many fine interstitial pores, extremely acid (pH 4.2); clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 7 inches thick)

     Bw1--6 to 16 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6), very gravelly sandy loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 55 percent fine gravel; few fine and very fine roots; many fine interstitial pores, extremely acid (pH 4.3), gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)

     Bw2--16 to 38 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6), extremely gravelly sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky, and nonplastic; 70 percent fine and medium gravel; few fine roots; very strongly acid (pH 4.5), gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 22 inches thick)

     Cr--38 to 42 inches; deeply weathered coarse-grained granite (grus).

TYPE LOCATION:  El Paso County, Colorado, about 6 miles southwest of Manitou Springs; 1.2 miles north, and 200 feet west of Reservoir No. 4 in the southeast quarter of the southwest quarter of Sec. 28, T. 14 S., R. 68 W.; Pikes Peak USGS quad; lat. 38 degrees 47 minutes 56 seconds N. and long. 105 degrees 00 minutes 00 seconds W., NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:(Depths given are measured from the mineral soil surface)
Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section is briefly dry in some part in late spring and early summer following snowmelt, moist in late July and August, and intermittently dry in fall; udic regime bordering on ustic.
Mean annual soil temperature:  37 to 46 degrees F.
Mean summer soil temperature:  43 to 50 degrees F.
Depth to paralithic contact:  20 to 40 inches
Depth to cambic horizon:  5 to 33 inches
Thickness of ochric epipedon: 2 to 6 inches
Reaction:  very strongly acid to slightly acid

Particle-size control section (weighted average):  
  Clay content:  7 to 18 percent
  Sand content:  40 to 70 percent
  Rock fragment content:  35 to 80 percent 
  Mica content: 45 to 60 percent (grain count)

A horizon (not in all pedons):
Hue:  10YR through 5YR
Value:  3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma:  1 through 4
Clay content:  3 to 16 percent
Rock fragments:  15 to 55 percent
Base saturation:  40 to 65 percent

E horizon:
Hue:  10YR through 5YR

Chroma:  2 through 4
Texture:  coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand (modified by rock fragments)
Clay content:  3 to 18 percent
Rock fragments:  25 to 65 percent
Base saturation:  30 to 65 percent

Bw horizons:
Hue:  10YR through 5YR
Value:  4 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist
Chroma:  4 through 6
Texture:  sandy loam or coarse sandy loam (modified by rock fragments)
Clay content:  7 to 18 percent
Rock fragments:  40 to 75 percent
Base saturation:  20 to 45 percent 

Some pedons have a C horizon.

Cr horizon:  Weathered metamorphic rocks or granite (grus).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Ivywild soils are on mountain slopes and ridges and have slopes ranging from 5 to 70 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium, slope alluvium, or till weathered from granite and metamorphic rocks.  At the type location the average annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 23 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 37 to 43 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 35 to 80 days.  Elevation ranges from 7,600 to 11,500 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Catamount, Sachett, and Legault soils.  The Catamount and Sachett soils have bedrock above depths of 20 inches.  The Legault soils are sandy-skeletal and shallow to paralithic rock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; medium or high runoff; moderately rapid or rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally for timber production, recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed.  Dominant vegetation is Douglas fir, Engelmann spruce, lodgepole pine, quaking aspen, and limber pine forest.  Understory vegetation consists of common juniper, kinnikinnick, wheatgrass, and Oregon grape. At the type location this soil was correlated to the Engelmann spruce/moss plant association.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mountainous areas of central Colorado; MLRA 48A.  The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  El Paso County (Pike National Forest, Eastern Part Soil Survey Area), Colorado, 1984.

REMARKS:  
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon: from 1 to 2 inches (A horizon)
Cambic horizon: from 6 to 38 inches (Bw1, Bw2 horizons)
Paralithic contact: at 38 inches (top of Cr layer)
Particle-size control section: the zone from 11 to 38 inches (part of Bw1, the Bw2 horizon)

The moisture regime subclass is not clear. As mapped, this soil seems to range from typic udic through ustic udic. Ustic udic was judged to best represent the typical forest plant community.

When established this series was classified as loamy-skeletal, mixed, Dystric Cryochrepts.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  This typical pedon was sampled for the NSSL. Survey area sample number 82CO-041-002.


The mineralogy class was changed from paramicaceous to micaceous in 07/2010 by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the responsible MLRA regional office.  The change was necessary based on the eleventh edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2010.
