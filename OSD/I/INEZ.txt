INEZ SERIES

The Inez series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium of late Pleistocene age. These nearly level soils are on stream terraces on flat coastal plains.  Slopes are typically less than 1 percent but range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Victoria County, Texas; 1980.

REMARKS:  These soils were formerly mapped in the Telferner or Straber series.  Classification was changed from Typic Albaqualfs to Albaquic Hapludalfs based on the soil moisture study "ISCOM VIII, Classification and Management of Wet Soils, 1990." Analysis of longterm soil moisture studies on similar soils have determined that these soils do not have a Aquic moisture regime.  
Edited 02-2015 (RM) by adding metric measurements, placing in a semi-tabular format, adding additional information to the location paragraph, updating the competing series, and geographically associated soils.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 36 cm (0 to 14 in) (A and E horizons)
Argillic horizon: 36 to 203 cm (14 to 80 in) (Bt and Btk horizons).
Vertic feature: Cracks and/or wedge-shaped aggregates within the upper part of the argillic horizon.
