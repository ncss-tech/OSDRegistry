The Irwin series consists of deep and very deep, moderately well drained that formed in loess over colluvium over residuum weathered from shale. Irwin soils are on hillslopes on uplands in the Central Kansas Sandstone Hills (MLRA 74). Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 840 millimeters (33 inches) and Mean annual air temperature is 12 degrees C (54 degrees F), at the type location.
