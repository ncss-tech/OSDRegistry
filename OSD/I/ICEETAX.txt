ICEETAX SERIES

The Iceetax series consists of shallowto a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from igneous rocks. Iceetax soils are on fan piedmont remnants.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, mesic, shallow Abruptic Xeric Argidurids

TYPICAL PEDON: Iceetax extremely cobbly loamy sand-Rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered with 35 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, 20 percent stones and 5 percent boulders.

(3 to 5 cm thick)

 A2--3 to 13 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely cobbly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and medium roots and many very fine roots; common very fine tubular and many very fine interstitial pores; 15 percent stones, 30 percent cobbles and 30 percent gravel; neutral, (pH 7.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 10 cm thick) 

 Bt--13 to 48 cm; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) extremely cobbly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; strong fine and medium angular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 50 percent prominent pressure faces on all faces of peds and 90 percent prominent clay films on surfaces along pores and 90 percent prominent clay films on all faces of peds; 10 percent stones, 25 percent gravel and 30 percent cobbles; neutral, (pH 7.3); abrupt wavy boundary. (23 to 36 cm thick)

 2Bqkm--48 to 66 cm; very strongly silica cemented duripan with common 1 mm thick silica laminae on upper surface; 30 percent carbonate  masses; clear wavy boundary. (15 to 50 cm thick)

 2Bqk--66 to 152 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely cobbly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 30 percent moderately cemented by silica that is slightly hard and extremely hard, and friable and very firm; common very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent stones, 30 percent cobbles and 30 percent gravel; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline, (pH 8.3)

COMPETING SERIES: There are currently no other series recognized in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Iceetax soils are on fan piedmont remnants. They typically occur on summit positions. They formed in alluvium derived from igneous rocks. Slopes are 4 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,590 to 1,740 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Holbrook and Leviathan series.  Holbrook soils do not have an argillic horizon or duripan. Leviathan soils have less than 35 percent clay in their particle-size control section and do not have a duripan.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very high surface runoff; very slow permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Iceetax soils are used for livestock grazing, recreation, watershed and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is mainly low sagebrush, desert needlegrass and bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern California, east of the Sierra Nevada Range. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 26.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California.
