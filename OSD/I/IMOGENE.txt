IMOGENE SERIES

The Imogene series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in saline, calcareous, loamy sediments of Pliestocene or Recent age. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on low stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 711 mm (28 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.5 degrees C (70.5 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, hyperthermic Mollic Natrustalfs

REMARKS:

Diagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 in) (A horizon)
Mollic subgroup--The surface has mollic colors but is both massive and hard when 
dry and will not qualify for the Mollisol order.
Natric horizon--13 to 71 (5 to 28 in) (Btn and Btkn horizons)

ADDITIONAL DATA: Lab data available on pedons from Goliad, Karnes, and Gonzales 
counties from local lab.
