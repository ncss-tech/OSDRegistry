ADDITIONAL DATA:

User pedon ID: 2022AK180541

The Igruk typical pedon classifies as a Terric Sapristel. 30 cm or more mineral soil material within 100 cm of the soil surface   is needed for the terric subgroup. The Igruk typical pedon has 28 cm of mineral dominated soil horizon overlain by a cryoturbated horizon which is 30 percent mineral soil material and therefore makes up the 2 extra cm of thickness.
