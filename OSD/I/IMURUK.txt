COMPETING SERIES: This is the Schleyer series. Schleyer soils have a mean summer soil temperature warmer than 36 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landforms: hills, outwash plains
Parent material: silty eolian deposits over gravelly outwash
Elevation: 404 to 778 feet
Slope: 0 to 30 percent
Annual precipitation: 22 to 29 inches
Annual temperature: 24.8 degrees F
Frost-free period: 60 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Dirrant, Kuzitrin, and Tisuk soils. Dirrant soils are very poorly drained, shallow to permafrost, and occur on till plains. Kuzitrin soils are somewhat poorly drained, very deep, and occur on swales on mountains and swales on till plains. Tisuk soils are well drained, very deep, and occur on mountains, hills, and till plains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessive drained, high runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the loess mantle and high to very high in the gravelly outwash.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for military use and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is ericaceous shrub/lichen dwarf scrub.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 240, Nulato Hills-Southern Seward Peninsula Highlands, Alaska. The series is of small extent.
