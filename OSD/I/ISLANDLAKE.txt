ISLANDLAKE SERIES

The Islandlake series consist of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits on kames, moraines, stream terraces, and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 7.2 degrees C (45 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Blue Lake, Lindquist series, and McMillan series. Blue Lake soils have an accumulation of lamellae within a depth of 203 cm that is more than 15 cm (6 inches). Lindquist soils do not have Bhs horizons. McMillan soils have more than 30 percent silt in the upper part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Islandlake soils are on outwash plains, kames, end moraines, stream terraces, and ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. These soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 813 mm (27 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 to 8.3 degrees C (43 to 47 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Au Gres, Blue Lake, Croswell, Kalkaska, and Southwells soils. The well drained Southwells and Blue Lake soils are on similar landscape positions. The Kalkaska soils do not have lamellae in the lower part of the subsoil and are on similar landscape positions. The somewhat poorly drained Au Gres soils and the moderately well drained Croswell soils are on outwash plains and are on slightly lower landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat excessively drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to low depending on slope. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high.

USE AND VEGETATION: A large part is in forestland. Forest vegetation consist chiefly of sugar maple, American beech, black cherry, American basswood, and bigtooth aspen. Some areas are in pasture, cropland, or idle cropland. The principal crops grown are small grain, hay and potatoes. Small areas of Christmas trees plantations are also present.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 94A and 96 in northern Lower Peninsula of Michigan. The series is of moderate extent.
