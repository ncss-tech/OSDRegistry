COMPETING SERIES: There are no series in the same family. Similar soils are the Grassypoint and Tracosa series.
Grassypoint soils: do not have dredgic, human-transported materials and have reddish subsoils.
Tracosa soils: do not have dredgic, human-transported materials and have yellowish subsoils.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: Clayey dredge spoils
Landscape: Barrier islands and coastal plains
Anthropogenic feature: Dredge spoils
Slope: 0 to 3 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 812 to 1575 millimeters (32 to 62 inches)
Mean annual air temperature: 20 to 23 degrees C (68 to 73 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 300 to 365 days
Elevation: 0 to 3 meters (0 to 10 feet)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Basford, Harris, Hoeckers, Neel, and Sievers series.
Basford soils: are on subaqueous landscapes, have subaqueous drainage, and are formed in coarse-loamy soils from dredge deposits.
Harris soils: occur on lower coastal marshlands, not on anthropogenic landforms, and do not have dredgic human-altered and human-transported materials.
Hoeckers soils: are on subaqueous landscapes, have subaqueous drainage, and have high shell fragment volumes.
Neel soils: have better drainage throughout and are on slightly higher landscape positions.
Siever soils: are slightly coarser textured throughout and occur on slightly higher positions on the landscape.

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major use: Rangeland and wildlife habitat
Vegetation: Salt tolerant species such as gulf cordgrass and common reedgrass

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
General Area: On barrier islands and mainland marshes near bays along the central coast of Texas
Land Resource Region: T-Atlantic and Gulf Coast Lowland Forest and Crop Region
MLRA(s): 150B-Gulf Coast Saline Prairies and 151-Gulf Coast Marsh
