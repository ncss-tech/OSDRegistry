IJAM SERIES

The Ijam series consists of very deep, poorly drained, low saturated hydraulic conductivity (very slowly permeable) soils that formed from materials dredged from rivers, bays, and canals. These gently sloping soils occur on flats in coastal areas. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1397 mm (55 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (70 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, dredgic, smectitic, nonacid, hyperthermic Typic Endoaquents

TYPICAL PEDON: Ijam clay-grass. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

    ^A--0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in); dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay; massive; very hard, very firm; many roots; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; diffuse smooth boundary. (Thickness is 5 to 25 cm [2 to 10 in]).

    ^Cg--20 to 203 cm (8 to 80 in); mixed dark gray (5Y 4/1) and gray (5Y 6/1) clay; massive; very hard, very firm; few fine roots mostly in the upper part; few thin discontinuous strata or lenses of sandy clay loam or fine sandy loam; common discontinuous bedding planes; few shells and shell fragments; few to common masses of iron accumulation in shades of yellowish brown and strong brown with clear and sharp boundaries in matrix; few to common iron depletions in shades of gray with diffuse and clear boundaries in matrix; moderately saline; moderately alkaline. (Thickness is 177 to 198 cm [70 to 78 in]).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no series in the same family. Similar soils are the Neches and Sievers series.
Neches soils: have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section.
Sievers soils: have a fine-loamy particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: Clayey dredge spoils 
Landscape: Lagoons
Landform: Flats
Anthroprogenc feature: dredge spoil banks
Microfeature: mounds

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Harris, Neal, and the Sievers series.
Harris soils: occur on lower coastal marshlands; are not on anthropogenic landforms; do not have dredgic human-altered and human transported material family class.
Neel and Sievers soils: loamy throughout; are on dredged materials on similar or  higher positions in the landscape.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage class: Poor 
Permeability class: very slow 
Runoff: very high 
Flooding: Occasionally or Frequently flooded for brief periods of time throughout the year. 
Seasonal Water Table: These soils have endosaturation from April through December from 46 to 102 cm.

USE AND VEGETATION:
Mainly used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. 
Native vegetation: mostly waterloving, salt tolerant species such as gulf cordgrass and common reedgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
General Area: Mainly along the upper Gulf Coast of Texas in the Gulf Marsh 
Land Resource Region: Atlantic and Gulf Coast Lowland Forest and Crop Region(T)  Major Land Resource Areas: 151, 150B;
