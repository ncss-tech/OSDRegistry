IDA SERIES

The Ida series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in calcareous loess. These soils are on side slopes and crests on dissected till plains and on risers on stream terraces. Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (49 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 74 centimeters (29 inches).

Cation exchange activity class is supported by lab sample number S98IA-047-005, KSSL.

Taxonomy version--twelfth edition, 2014.

The redoximorphic features described in this pedon are believed to be relict and were not considered as indicators of present drainage conditions. These features were not considered in the classification of these soils.
