INAVALE SERIES

The Inavale series consists of very deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils formed in sandy alluvium on flood plains in river valleys of the Rolling Plains and Breaks in (MLRA 73). Slopes range from 0 to 11 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 660 millimeters (26 inches) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Typic Ustifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Inavale loamy fine sand with a slope of less than 2 percent, in rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.) 

	A--0 to 20 centimeters (0 to 8 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loamy fine sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak coarse granular structure; loose; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (10 to 36 centimeters (4 to 14 inches) thick)

	AC--20 to 43 centimeters (8 to 17 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loamy sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; single grained; loose; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 41 centimeters (0 to 16 inches) thick)

	C--43 to 200 centimeters (17 to 79 inches); light gray (10YR 7/2) fine sand, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; single grained; loose; thin strata of finer and coarser textured sediments; slightly alkaline.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage: Excessively drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: high or very high
Runoff: negligible or very low

USE AND VEGETATION: The major use is livestock grazing. A few areas are hayed and some are cultivated especially those with finer textured surface layers or irrigated. The native plant community for the sandy lowland ecological site (R065XY029NE) is mostly sand bluestem, little bluestem, prairie sandreed, needle and thread, and switchgrass. Some areas are dominated by trees and shrubs.

LRR H Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range, MLRA 71, Central Nebraska Loess Hills, MLRA 72 Central High Tableland, MLRA 73, Rolling Plains and Breaks, MLRA 74 Central Kansas Sandstone Hills, MLRA 75 Central Loess Plains; LRR G Western Great Plains Range and Irrigated Region, MLRA 66 Dakota-Nebraska Eroded Tableland; LRR M Central Feed Grains and Livestock Region, 102C Loess uplands.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Douglas County, Nebraska, 1970.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons or features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 20 centimeters (0 to 8 inches) (A horizon)

Keys to Soil Taxonomy: Eleventh edition, 2010

A channeled phase is recognized

02/2004 WAW: Added coarse sand to range of A horizon textures based on Roger Hammer's project, Revision of interdunal soils mapped on flood plains. Revised Geographically Associated Soils section.

01/2008 RRH: Areas of Inavale soils having aquic conditions from 100 to 183 centimeters need to be recorrelated or remapped to the Calamus or Inglewood series depending on whether in the ustic or udic moisture regime. 

01/2008 RRH: Areas of Inavale soils mapped in the aridic-ustic and udic moisture regimes need to be recorrelated. Inavale soils mapped in the typic-ustic and udic-ustic moisture regimes can remain Inavale because the flooding may be more significant than the adjacent moisture regime differences. 

01/2008 RRH: metric conversion; Range in Characteristics: revised; Geographic Setting: revised; Geographically Associated Soils: revised to fit soils at type location, many different catena of soils exist throughout its extent; Use and Vegetation: revised; Distribution and Extent: revised; Additional Data: added

7/2011 JGA: Added soil temperature regime, mean annual soil temperature, particle size clay and sand to the RIC.  Increased mean annual precipitation to 760 mm from 710 mm based on climate data. Updated geographically associated soils and added keys to soil taxonomy edition. Changed precipitation values from centimeters to millimeters. Removed silt loam from surface texture, since it is not used in any surface texture in map units.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Data is available from the National Soil Survey Center, Soil Survey Laboratory for Pedon IDs, 80NE061001, 04NE153001, and 04NE053003. Pedon ID 1974NE181010-OSD represents the Typical Pedon and is in NASIS. Kansas State University Laboratory, Manhattan, KS pedon 09KS1571050.
