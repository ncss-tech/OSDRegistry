GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ugguktuk, Tui, Sikuruk, Kimigaak, Siksrik, and Amigak soils.
Ugguktuk soils are somewhat poorly drained with aquic conditions between 37 to 90 cm (15 to 35 in) and occur on broad ridges on summit positions.
Tui soils have a cambic horizon between 6 to 44 cm (2 to 17 in) and occur on similar landforms on nose slopes.
Sikuruk soils have permafrost at depths below 80 cm (31 in), aquic conditions at the surface, and occur on saddles of hills.
Kimigaak soils have andic soil properties at depths between 3 to 16 cm (1 to 6 in) and occur on ridges of hills.
Siksrik soils do not have paralithic contact within 200 cm (80 in) and occur on footslopes and backslopes of hillslopes.
Amigak soils have aquic conditions at the soil surface and a cambic horizon at depths between 27 and 95 cm (11 to 37 in) and occur on side slopes of backslopes.
