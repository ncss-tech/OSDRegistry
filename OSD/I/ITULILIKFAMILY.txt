ITULILIKFAMILY SERIES

Note: Used as a placeholder series until a series is established under the family class
Depth class: Very deep
Drainage class: very poorly drained
Parent material: loess and alluvium 
Landform: depressions on hills, terraces, fans, and floodplains 
Slopes: 0 to 10 percent
Mean annual precipitation: about 16 inches
Mean annual temperature: about 29 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, nonacid Typic Cryaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Itulilikfamily mucky silt loam - on a slope of 0 percent in a thermokarst depression on a terrace under tundra vegetation at 39 feet elevation. (All colors are for moist soil unless noted)

      Oi--0 to 4 inches, (0 to 9 cm); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) peat; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; strongly acid, pH 5.6; clear smooth boundary.

      Bg--4 to 18 inches, (9 to 46 cm); 15 percent dark brown (10YR 3/3) and 85 percent gray (N 5/) mucky silt loam; moderate thick platy structure; friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium and course roots; 5 percent medium strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) moist redox concentrations; moderately acid, pH 6.0; gradual smooth boundary.

      Cg1--18 to 59 inches, (46 to 150 cm); dark olive gray (5Y 3/2) silt loam; massive; friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots throughout; 8 percent medium yellowish red (5YR 5/6) moist redox concentrations; slightly acid, pH 6.3; gradual smooth boundary.

      Cg2--59 to 75 inches, (152 to 190 cm); dark olive brown (2.5Y 3/3) silt loam;  massive; friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots throughout; slightly acid, pH 6.3.

COMPETING SERIES: These are no series in this family.  When a series is established, this series placeholder will be dropped (see REMARKS).
 
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loess and alluvium
Landform: Depressions on hills, terraces, fans, and floodplains
Slope: 0 to 10 percent
Mean annual temperature: 28 to 30 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 15 to 18 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Typic Haplocryepts and Typic Cryofluvents on plain or slightly convex slopes of similar landforms. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained. Low to medium runoff. Permeability is moderate.
 
USE AND VEGETATION: Used for subsistence and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is typical of Boreal scrub, woodland, and forestland.
 
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 229 - Interior Alaska Lowlands; MLRA 230 - Yukon-Kuskokwim Highlands; and MLRA 238- Yukon-Kuskokwim Coastal Plain, Alaska. The soil is extensive.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: WASILLA, ALASKA

SERIES PROPOSED: The Western Interior Rivers Area, Alaska, 2007

REMARKS: This series is set-up as a placeholder to allow the use of a short family name.  The range in characteristics is broader than a typical series and may even encompass the full range of the family.  There are currently no series designated in this soil family.

Diagnostic features and horizons recognized in this profile include:
Mineral horizons: from 4 to 75 inches.
Temperature regime: Cryic
Moisture regime: Aquic
