COMPETING SERIES: These are the Chenega (AK), Hollow (AK), Kidazqeni (AK), Malmesbury (AK), Shovel Creek (AK), Stratify (AK), Togiak (AK), and Willow River (AK) soils.
Chenega soils have silt loam caps and are strongly acid to moderately acid at depth.
Hollow soils are somewhat poorly drained and have mineral horizons that are effervescent.
Kidazqeni soils have acidic pH values in all horizons
Malmesbury soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 3 to 6 C (38 to 42 F).
Shovel Creek soils have a thin B horizon with sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam textures.
Stratify soils have very gravelly sand stratified with thin lenses of silt loam and fine sandy loam in the substratum, substantial mica content in the profile, are moderately well drained, and occur on flood plains and low terraces.
Togiak soils have a mean annual precipitation of about 760 mm (30 in), are somewhat excessively drained, and occur on beach berms of shore complexes.
Willow river soils have a buried cambic horizon at depths between 25 to 93 cm (10 to 37 in), occasional flooding frequency, and occur on similar landforms
