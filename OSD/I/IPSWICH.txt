SERIES ESTABLISHED: Essex County, Massachusetts, 1977.

REMARKS: 
These soils were formerly mapped as tidal marsh.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include--
Hemic material--the zone from 0 to 107 centimeters has rubbed fiber content between 16 and 40 percent (Oese1 and Oese2 horizons).
Sapric material--the zone from 107 to 200 centimeters has a rubbed fiber content less than 16 percent (Oase horizon).
Sulfihemists great group--sulfidic materials within a depth of 100 centimeters. New pedons should include incubation pH measurements and or odor to determine if horizons should receive a 'se' subordinate distinction due to sulfate content.
Reaction (pH value)--more than 4.5 throughout the control section.
