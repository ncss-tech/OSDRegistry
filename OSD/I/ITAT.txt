ITAT SERIES

The Itat series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basalt mixed with minor amounts of loess and, in places, old alluvium. Itat soils are on hills and plateaus. Slopes are 5 to 45 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Humic Haploxerepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Itat cobbly loam - forested on a 14 percent south-facing backslope at an elevation of 2,700 feet. (Colors are dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 C--32 to 61 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) extremely cobbly loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; many very fine irregular pores; 40 percent gravel and 35 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2).

TYPE LOCATION: Klickitat County, Washington; about 9 miles northeast of Goldendale; 1,100 feet south and 50 feet east of the northwest corner, section 13, T. 5N., R. 17 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F. The soil moisture control section is usually moist, but is dry in all parts for 75 to 90 consecutive days following summer solstice. The thickness of the solum is 20 to 40 inches. The particle-size control section averages 18 to 20 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.

The A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 dry and moist. It has 10 to 15 percent gravel and 10 to 15 percent cobbles.

The BA and Bw horizons have hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 dry and moist. These horizons average 15 to 20 percent clay and from 20 to 35 percent rock fragments including 15 to 25 percent gravel and 5 to 10 percent cobbles. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.

The BC horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 dry and moist. It averages 15 to 20 percent clay and from 30 to 50 percent gravel and 5 to 10 percent cobbles. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.

The C horizon averages 20 to 25 percent clay and from 45 to 75 percent rock fragments including 40 to 60 percent gravel and 5 to 35 percent cobbles. Texture is extremely cobbly loam, very gravelly loam or extremely gravelly sandy clay loam. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.

Maki series  20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact (calcareous shale); very slightly to strongly effervescent throughout; slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout
Pardaloe series  40 to 60 inches to a lithic contact (sandstone); dry for 90 or more consecutive days following the summer solstice; mean annual soils temperature of 54 to 59 degrees F.
Rockyglen series - dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice; particle-size control section dominated by rock fragments of sandstone or greywacke origin

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Itat soils are on foothills, hillslopes, and plateaus at elevations of 1,300 to 3,400 feet. Itat soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basalt mixed with minor amounts of loess and in some places old alluvium with quartzitic gravel. Summers are warm and dry and winters are cool and moist. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches. The mean January temperature is 26 degrees F, and the mean July temperature is 64 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free season is about 110 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Berson, Gunn, Kiakus, Leidl, Munset, Nook, Rockly and Wahoo soils. Berson soils are frigid. Gunn soils have an argillic horizon and are fine-loamy. Kiakus, Leidl and Munset soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock. Nook soils have a mollic epipedon. Rockly and Wahoo soils are less than 20 inches deep to lithic contact. Berson soils are on footslopes and backslopes of mountains.  Gunn soils are plateaus and hillslopes.  Kiakus soils are on benches, canyon side slopes, and plateaus.  Leidl soils are on canyon side slopes and plateaus.  Munset soils are on plateaus.  Nook soils are on alluvial fans and low terraces.  Rockly soils are on canyon side slopes and plateaus.  Wahoo soils are on canyon side slopes and plateaus.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for timber production, grazable woodland, and wildlife habitat. Vegetation is ponderosa pine and Oregon white oak, with an understory of antelope bitterbrush, elk sedge, common snowberry, snowbrush ceanothus, creambush oceanspray, lupine, and American vetch.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Klickitat County, Washington; MLRA 6. The series is moderately extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Klickitat County, Washington, 2003.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from 1 to 10 inches.
Cambic horizon - the zone from 10 to 32 inches.
Humic subgroup - the color requirements are meet from 1 to 32 inches 
Particle-size control section - the zone from 11 to 41 inches
The Oi horizon was originally described as 0.5 inch thick. The depth was increased to 1 inch for simplicity of horizon measurement.
Depth to diagnostic horizons and features is measured from the top of the first mineral layer.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Partial laboratory data are available for this soil. Lab Number S86WA-039-001.
