IDWAY SERIES 

Idway series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Idway soils are on alluvial flats, beach plains, and basin-floor remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 cm and the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Durinodic Xeric Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Idway loamy sand--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is partially covered with 25 percent gravel.

    Bqk2--50 to 69 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; strong thick platy structure parting to strong thin platy; hard, firm and brittle, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots in pockets and few in matrix; many very fine interstitial pores and few very fine tubular; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) organic stains on plate surfaces, root mats, and along root channels; 60 percent strongly cemented matrix, 30 percent weak and 10 percent noncemented pockets of loamy sand; 5 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 20 cm thick)

    2Cqk--69 to 152 cm; variegated stratified gravelly coarse sand to sand; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 10 percent 2.5 to 7.5 cm thick discontinuous cemented lenses; 30 percent gravel; few carbonate and silica pendants on bottoms of rock fragments; slightly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.6).

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Buko series.  Buko soils have B horizons with clay content of 18 to 35 percent and texture of clay loam or silty clay loam.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Idway soils are on alluvial flats, beach plains, and basin-floor remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations range from 1,710 to 1,895 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Kawich, Kunzler, and Mysol soils.  Kawich soils are on stable sand dunes.  Kunzler soils are coarse-loamy and have a calcic horizon.  Mysol soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderate over rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Idway soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, black greasewood, Indian ricegrass, and basin wildrye.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 28B.
