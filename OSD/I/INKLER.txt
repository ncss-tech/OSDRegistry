INKLER SERIES

The Inkler series consists of very deep and deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over glacial till or colluvium derived from volcanic and metamorphic rocks. Inkler soils are on moraines, hillslopes and mountain slopes.  Slopes of 0 to 75 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 635 mm and the mean annual temperature is 6.1 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Baldknob, Kiehl, Nevine, Scoap, and Thout soils. Baldknob soils are 25 to 50 cm to a lithic contact and are on summits, shoulders, and backslopes of glacially scoured foothills and mountains. Kiehl soils have a sandy-skeletal control section and are on glacial outwash terraces and terrace escarpments. Nevine soils are ashy over loamy-skeletal and are on moraines, foothills, and mountains. Scoap soils have a mollic epipedon 50 to 75 cm thick and are on uplands and mountainsides. Thout soils are 50 to 100 cm to a lithic contact and are on glaciated mountainsides and ridgetops.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; moderate to rapid saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Mostly grazable woodland and some dryland cropland.  Native vegetation is Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine and western larch with an understory of common snowberry, wildrose, spirea, pinegrass, mallow ninebark, creambush oceanspray, and pachystima.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern Washington. MLRA 43A, 6. The Inkler series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Stevens County (North Ferry Area), Washington, l97l

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 10 cm (A horizon)
Andic feature - the zone from 0 to 23 cm (A, Bw1 horizons). The layer from 23 to 53 cm (2Bw2) is mixed and is assumed not to meet andic soil properties 
Cambic horizon - the zone from 10 to 53 cm (Bw1, 2Bw2 horizons) 
Particle-size control section - the zone from 25 to 100 cm (part of 2Bw2, 2C1, part of 2C2 horizons)

Additional information: The modal concept of this series regarding depth class is greater than 150 cm to bedrock. The Cashmere Mountain Areas, Washington (WA608) soil survey recognized the Inkler series as 100 to 150 cm to lithic bedrock. Upon update of this survey, consideration should be given in correlation of this soil series concept to another series or propose a new series.
