IRAAN SERIES

The Iraan series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in calcareous loamy alluvium derived from limestone. These nearly level soils occur on flood plains along streams on dissected plateaus and river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 406 mm (16 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 17.8 degrees C (64 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, thermic Cumulic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Iraan silty clay loam, on a flood plain - in rangeland.
     (Colors are dry soil unless other stated.)

Thickness is 10 to 61 cm (4 to 24 in)

    A2--18 to 71 cm (7 to 28 in); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; few wormcasts, common pores, few rounded limestone gravel less than 4 mm (1/8 in) in diameter; few films and threads of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  Thickness is 20 to 81 cm (8 to 32 in)

Combined thickness of the Bk horizon is 94 to 145 cm (37 to 57 in)

    Bk2--109 to 203 cm (43 to 80 in); brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; common rounded gravel less than 4 mm (1/8 in) in diameter; few films and threads of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bergstrom, Bigetty, and Port series in the same family. Similar soils are the Oakalla and Rioconcho series.
Bergstrom and Port: occur in areas that receive more rainfall and are moist for longer periods
Bigetty: these soils occur in drier areas that receive less rainfall
Oakalla: these sois have a fine-loamy particle-size control section and have greater  amounts of calcium carbonate
Rioconcho: these soils have a fine particle-size control section and have vertic properties

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent Material: calcareous loamy alluvium derived from limestone
Landscape: dissected plateaus and river valleys
Landform: flood plain
Slope: 0 to 2 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 356 to 533 mm (14 to 21 in)
Thornthwaite P.E. indices: 18 to 26

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dalby, Dev, Ector, Hodgins, Lozier, Reagan, Sanderson, and Upton series.
Dalby: these soils have slickensides and a fine particle-size control section and occur on similar postions
Dev: these soils have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section and occur on similar positions
Ector and Lozier: these soils are shallow to a lithic contact and occur on ridgetops and sideslopes
Hodgins and Reagan: these soils have an ochric epipedon and occur on broader alluvial flats
Sanderson: these soils have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section and occur on higher fans and footslopes
Upton: these soils are shallow to a petrocalcic horizon and occur on slightly higher fans and footslopes

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Runoff is negligible on slopes less than 1 percent and very low on 1 to 2 percent slopes. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are in native rangeland.  A few areas are in irrigated cropland.  Crops are mainly cotton, grain sorghum, small grain, alfalfa and vegetables.  The native vegetation is sideoats grama, tobosa grass, plains bristlegrass, blue grama and vine-mesquite.  Woody species include mesquite, black walnut, hackberry and western soapberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The Western part of Texas; LRR I - Southwest Plateaus and Plains Range and Cotton Region; Edwards Plateau, Western Part (MLRA 81A).  The series is of moderate extent.
