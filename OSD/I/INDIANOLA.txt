INDIANOLA SERIES

The Indianola series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in sandy glacial drift. Indianola soils are on hills, terraces, terrace escarpments, eskers, and kames of drift or outwash plains at elevations of near sea level to 1,000 feet. Slopes are 0 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 55 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Isotic, mesic Dystric Xeropsamments

TYPICAL PEDON: Indianola loamy sand-forested. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Oi--0 to 1 inch; slightly decomposed plant material; abrupt smooth boundary.

 A--1 to 6 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loamy sand, black (10YR 2/1) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.

 Bw1--6 to 17 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine, fine, and common medium roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.

 Bw2--17 to 27 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary.

 BC--27 to 37 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; common fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary.

 C--37 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; neutral (pH 6.6).

TYPE LOCATION: Thurston County, Washington; about 2 miles southeast of Tumwater, north end of Munn Lake near Department of Game boat launching site; 2,200 feet east and 2,550 feet north of the southwest corner sec. 1, T. 17 N., R. 2 W. Willamette Baseline Meridian; USGS Maytown NE quarter quadrangle; lat. 46 degrees 59 minutes 18 seconds N. and long. 122 degrees 52 minutes 40 seconds W., NAD83.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Keystone series. Keystone soils are dry in the moisture control section for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Similar series classified in a mixed mineralogy family but are likely isotic as well are Birdsview, Greenwater, and Pilchuck series. Birdsview soils are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Greenwater soils have 5 to 25 percent volcanic ash, cinders, and pumice in the control section. Pilchuck soils have chroma of 2 or less throughout the control section, and have an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Indianola soils are on hills, terraces, terrace escarpments, eskers, or kames of drift or outwash plains at elevations of near sea level to 1,000 feet. Slopes are 0 to 70 percent. These soils formed in sandy glacial drift and minor amounts of volcanic ash. They are in a maritime climate of cool dry summers and mild wet winters. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 55 inches most of which falls between October and April. Mean January temperature is 36 degrees F., the average July temperature is 62 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F. The frost-free season ranges from 180 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alderwood, Cassolary, Everett, Hoypus, Kitsap, Nisqually, Quilcene, Sinclair, Spanaway, and Tokul soils. Alderwood, Sinclair, and Tokul soils have dense glacial till at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Cassolary soils are fine-loamy. Everett, Hoypus and Spanaway soils are sandy-skeletal. Kitsap soils are fine- silty. Nisqually soils have an umbric epipedon. Quilcene soils have a fine control section and are underlain by weathered shale at depths of 20 to 40 inches.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat excessively drained. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is very high.

USE AND VEGETATION: Timber production, forage production, and pasture. Potential natural vegetation is Douglas-fir, western redcedar, western hemlock, red alder and bigleaf maple, with an understory of salal, Oregongrape, red huckleberry, western brackenfern, western swordfern, trailing blackberry, evergreen huckleberry, and vine maple.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Puget lowlands in Northwestern Washington, MLRA 2, northern part. The series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Kitsap County, Washington, 1935.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon
Particle-size control section - 10 to 40 inches

This revision (7/2009) reflects a new description of the type location which adds an Oi horizon to this soil which is naturally forested.
