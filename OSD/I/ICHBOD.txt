ICHBOD SERIES

The Ichbod series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from andesite and rhyolite.  These soils are on hills.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, smectitic, frigid, shallow Aridic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ichbod gravelly sandy loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 8 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate thin platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 15 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to 15 cm thick)

    Bt1--8 to 18 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; common faint clay films lining pores and bridges between sand grains; 10 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 13 cm thick)

    Bt2--18 to 30 cm; ped surfaces are brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly sandy clay, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; ped interiors are very pale brown (10YR 8/4) dry, very pale brown (10YR 7/4) moist; moderate fine angular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; many distinct and prominent clay films on faces of ped ; 20 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 15 cm thick)

    Bt3--30 to 48 cm; ped surfaces are brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly sandy clay, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; ped interiors are very pale brown (10YR 8/4) dry, very pale brown (10YR 7/4) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure; hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; continuous prominent clay films on faces of ped ; 20 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 25 cm thick)

   Cr--48 to 89 cm; decomposed andesite; few faint and distinct clay films along weak fracture planes; clear wavy boundary.  (25 to 66 cm thick)

    R--89 cm; hard andesite.

TYPE LOCATION:  Elko County, Nevada, about 40 miles south of Elko, Nevada; approximately 620 feet north and 670 feet east of the southwest corner of section 4, T. 27 N., R. 54 E.; USGS Garcia Flat 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 14 minutes 45 seconds N and longitude 115 degrees 54 minutes 17 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.2458333latitude, -115.9047222 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist in winter and spring, dry July through October; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 6 to 8 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 18 to 30 cm includes upper part of argillic horizon.
Depth to paralithic contact: 36 to 50 cm.
Depth to hard bedrock: 33 to 100 cm.

Particle-size control Section - Clay content:  35 to 50 percent.
Rock fragments:  15 to 35 percent, mainly fine gravel.

A horizon  
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.

Bt1 horizon  
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3. 
Clay content:  25 to 35 percent.

8 dry, 3 through 7 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4.
Texture:  Gravelly sandy clay or gravelly clay.
Clay content:  35 to 50 percent.
Rock fragments:  15 to 35 percent.
Other features:  Dark colors commonly on ped surface are organic stains, light colors commonly ped interiors.

Cr horizons  
Colors:  Reflect primary rock minerals.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Cotant series.  Cotant soils have less than 15 percent gravel in argillic horizons and 5 to 13 cm thick surface layer overlying a fine textured argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ichbod soils are on hills.  These soils formed in residuum from andesite or rhyolite.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 1,895 to 2,200 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 to 360 mm; mean annual air temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Akler, Kleckner and Stampede soils.  Akler soils have a ochric epipedon. Kleckner soils have a clayey-skeletal argillic horizon.  Stampede soils are moderately deep to duripan.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; slow saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is mainly big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, cheatgrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, Sandberg bluegrass, and Douglas rabbitbrush with sparse (widely scattered) Utah juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Nevada.  The soils are not extensive. MLRA 25.
