IBEX SERIES 

The Ibex series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in alluvium.  These soils are on low stream terraces and flood plains. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, acid, frigid Typic Endoaquepts 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ibex silt loam, forested (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted). 

     A--0 to 1 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak fine and medium granular structure; hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; strongly acid (pH 5.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 2 inches thick) 

     E--1 to 4 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak fine and medium granular structure; hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and common fine roots; strongly acid (pH 5.2); abrupt wavy boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick) 

     Bw1--4 to 9 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) dry; weak very coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; few distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) redox concentrations; strongly acid (pH 5.2); clear wavy boundary. 

     Bw2--9 to 25 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; weak very coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; few distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) redox concentrations; strongly acid (pH 5.4); gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of Bw horizons is 11 to 25 inches) 

     C1--25 to 29 inches; variegated colors consisting of about 80 percent grayish brown (10YR 5/2) and 20 percent gray (10YR 5/1) fine sandy loam, light gray (10YR 7/2 and 10YR 7/1) dry; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common distinct strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) redox concentrations; strongly acid (pH 5.4); clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 4 inches thick) 

     2C2--29 to 52 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) extremely gravelly coarse sand, light gray (10YR 7/1) dry; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; 10 percent cobbles, 55 percent pebbles; strongly acid (pH 5.4); clear wavy boundary. (16 to 28 inches thick) 

     2C3--52 to 60 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) extremely gravelly coarse sand, brown (7.5YR 5/4) dry; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; 10 percent cobbles, 55 percent pebbles; strongly acid (pH 5.4).

REMARKS:  Soils Interpretation Record:  MT1513.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches (A, E, and Bw1 horizons); a cambic horizon from 4 to 25 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bw2, C1, 2C2 horizons).  Ibex soils have an aquic moisture regime and a frigid temperature regime.
