INSIDERT SERIES

The Insidert series consists of moderately deep to duripan, well drained soils with slow permeability that formed in alluvium and loess from basalt and volcanic ash.  Insidert soils are on calderas.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the average annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Abruptic Argiduridic Durixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Insidert silt loam -- on a northwest-facing slightly convex slope of 3 percent, in native rangeland at 1,632 meter elevation.  (When described on October 6, 1981, the soil was dry from 0 to 6 inches, slightly moist from 15 to 43 cm, and dry below.  Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 15 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine platy structure parting to moderate fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine, common medium roots; many fine and very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to 23 cm thick)

    Bt1--15 to 23 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) clay, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine angular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and very fine, few medium roots; common fine and very fine tubular pores; continuous distinct clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to 33 cm thick)

    Bt2--23 to 33 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay; brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine prismatic structure parting to strong fine and medium angular blocky; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine, very fine and medium roots; common fine and very fine tubular pores; continuous prominent clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.3); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 20 cm thick)

    Bt3--33 to 43 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; strong medium angular blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine, very fine and medium roots; common fine and very fine tubular pores; continuous prominent clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 5 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 10 cm thick)

    Bkq--43 to 61 cm; white (10YR 8/2) very gravelly sandy loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and very fine roots; few fine and very fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel, 35 percent indurated duripan fragments; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 41 cm thick)

    Bkqm--61 to 69 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) continuous very thin siliceous lamination over white (10YR 8/2) continuous, indurated duripan; massive; extremely hard, brittle; 50 percent rock fragments; violent effervescence; abrupt wavy boundary.  (3 to 20 cm thick)

    2R--69 cm; basalt.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Igdell series.  Igdell soils are over 40 inches deep to bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Insidert soils are undulating on calderas at elevations of 1,620 to 1,800 meters.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium and loess from basalt and volcanic ash.  The climate is cool and moist in winter and warm and dry in summer.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 280 to 330 mm.  Average annual temperature ranges from 5.6 to 7.2 degrees C.  Frost-free period is 75 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bigflat, Heckison and Tanner series.  Bigflat soils lack a duripan.  Heckison soils have less than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Tanner soils lack an abrupt textural change.  These soils are on similar landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff; slowsaturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Insidert soils are used mainly for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The dominant natural vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, and western wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Idaho.  Insidert soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 25.
