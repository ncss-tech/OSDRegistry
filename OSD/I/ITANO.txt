ITANO SERIES

The Itano series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from granitic rock sources.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 381 millimeters (15 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (60 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, acid, thermic Typic Fluvaquents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Itano silty clay loam - cultivated.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 38 centimeters (0 to 15 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; hard, friable, sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; very strongly acid (pH 4.6); clear smooth boundary.  (13 to 46 centimeters (5 to 18) inches thick)

    2Ab--38 to 86 centimeters (15 to 34 inches); grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay loam, very dark gray (5Y 3/1) moist; many medium prominent reddish brown (5YR 5/4) redox depletions and concentrations, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; very strongly acid (pH 4.8); gradual smooth boundary.  (15 to 76 centimeters (6 to 30 inches) thick)

    2Cg1--86 to 112 centimeters (34 to 44 inches); grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) stratified silty clay loam, dark olive gray (5Y 3/2) moist; common medium prominent reddish brown (5YR 5/4) redox concentrations, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; very strongly acid (pH 4.6); gradual smooth boundary.  (20 to 76 centimeters (8 to 30 inches) thick)

    2Cg2--112 to 152 centimeters (44 to 60 inches); grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) stratified silty clay loam, dark olive gray (5Y 3/2) moist; common medium prominent reddish brown (5YR 5/4) redox concentrations, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) and yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; very strongly acid (pH 4.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  San Joaquin County, California; 0.34 miles northeast of the bridge of Big Brother Slough and 900 feet south of the levee, Mandeville Island; 38 degrees 03 minutes 1 second north Latitude, 121 degrees 32 minutes 44 seconds west Longitude. (in an unsectionized area) Bouldin Island quadrangle.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

The mean soil temperature: 15 to 18 degrees C (60 to 64 degrees F) 
Organic matter: stratified and decreases irregularly with increasing depth
Control section: averages 20 to 30 percent clay.

The A horizon:

Value: 3, 4 or 5 dry, 3 moist
Chroma: 2 dry and moist
Redoximorphic features: prominent fine and medium
Texture of the fine earth: stratified fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, silt loam or silty clay loam
Reaction: very strongly or extremely acid.

COMPETING SERIES:  At this time there are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Itano soils occur in old river channels and on flood plains and river deltas at elevations of 1.5 meters (5 feet) above sea level to 4.6 meters (15 feet) below sea level on islands protected by levees.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The climate is subhumid mesothermal with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 356 to 406 millimeters (14 to 16 inches).  Mean annual temperature is about 15 degrees C (60 to 61 degrees F), average January temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F), the average July temperature is about 23 degrees C (73 degrees F), and the frost-free period is 260 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Columbia, Dello, Kingile, Merritt, Peltier, Rindge and the Valdez series.  Columbia soils have less than 18 percent clay in the 25 to 100 centimeter (10 to 40 inch) control section.  Dello soils are sandy.  Kingile soils have continuous clayey mineral layers at 41 to 91 centimeters (16 to 36 inches) below a histic epipedon.  Peltier soils have a mollic epipedon and a fine control section.  Rindge soils have continuous sapric organic materials to a depth of 130 centimeters (51 inches) or more.  Valdez soils are nonacid.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; very slow runoff or ponded; moderately slow permeability.  The water table is lowered by open drains and pumps.  The water table is at depths of 3 to 4.5 feet during the growing season.  The soils are subject to rare flooding.  Some areas are flooded during the early part of the winter for control of weeds, salt reduction and for the creation of waterfowl habitat.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The Itano soils are used for growing field crops, row crops and some vineyards.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Itano soils are in the islands of the San Joaquin-Sacramento Delta, California.  This soil is not extensive in MLRA-16.
