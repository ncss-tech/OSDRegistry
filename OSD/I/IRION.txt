IRION SERIES

The Irion series consists of very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in clayey alluvium derived from limestone over fractured limestone bedrock of the Buda Formation of Cretaceous age. These nearly level soils occur in shallow depressions.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 559 mm (22 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C (64 degrees F).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Texas in the Edwards Plateau, Western Part (MLRA 81A) and the Edwards Plateau, Central Part (MLRA 81B).  The series is of moderate extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE:  Temple, Texas.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Crockett County, Texas: 2002.  The series was proposed and established for a special survey of the Texas Range Station in 1938.  The series was later deactivated and combined with the Lipan and Roscoe series.  The series is reactivated to interpret soils originally proposed for the Irion series.

REMARKS:  This soil was formerly included with the Roscoe and Lipan series.

Edited 11/2013 (RFG-THW): Converted to tabular format and added metric measurements. Updated the competing series, geographic setting, and associated soils sections.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 36 cm (0 to 14 in) (Al and A2 horizons)
Vertisol feature: Slickensides: 36 to 137 cm (14 to 54 in) (Bssl and Bss2 horizons) and cracks that open and close periodically.
Cambic horizon: 137 to 183 cm (54 to 72 in) (Bk horizon)
Lithic contact: at 183 cm (72 in) (R horizon)
