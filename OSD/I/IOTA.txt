IOTA SERIES

The Iota series consists of very deep, well drained soils. These soils formed in loamy and clayey sediments of Pleistocene age.  These gently sloping to moderately sloping soils are on terraces.  Slopes range from 3 to 8 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 19.5 degrees C (67 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1549 mm (61in).

Basile soils:  on flood plains of drainageways.  
Barbary soils:  very poorly drained, fluid clays in swamps at lower elevations.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is very slow.  Runoff is very high on 3 to 5 and 5 to 8 percent  slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of the acreage is in woodland, mainly loblolly pine with mixed hardwoods that have encroached onto the native prairie.  A small acreage is used for crops and pasture.  Main crop grown is soybeans.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwest Louisiana and possibly southeast Texas; LRR T; MLRA 150A.  The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Temple, Texas.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Acadia Parish, Louisiana; 2000.

REMARKS:  The Iota soils were formerly included with the Acadia, Gore, Muskogee, or McKamie series. The series description was updated during the Soil Data Join and Recorrelation initiative.
Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:

Ochric epipedon-0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 inches) (A and E horizons).
Albic horizon-8 to 18 cm (3 to 7 inches) (E horizon). 
Argillic horizon-18 to 71 cm (7 to 28 inches) (Bt and Btss horizons).
Vertic properties/slickensides-41 to 71 cm (16 to 28 inches) (Btss horizon).
Clay decreases with depth- the clay content of the control section decreases by 20 percent (relative) or more from the top of the argillic horizon within a depth of 60 inches.
