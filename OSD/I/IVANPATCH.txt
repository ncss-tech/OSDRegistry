IVANPATCH SERIES

The Ivanpatch series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from sedimentary formations high in gypsum and calcium carbonate.  Ivanpatch soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 1 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Leptic Haplogypsids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ivanpatch fine sandy loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 2 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate thin platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; many very fine vesicular and common fine tubular pores; disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent, 24 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 2 to 3 percent crystalline gypsum as sand grains; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 2 inches thick)

    By1--2 to 11 inches; reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine tubular pores; disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent, 22 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 5 percent crystalline gypsum as sand grains; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

    By2--11 to 25 inches; reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine tubular and interstitial pores; disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent, 23 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 10 percent crystalline gypsum as sand grains and small clusters of crystals; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 20 inches thick)

    By3--25 to 46 inches; reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine tubular and interstitial pores; disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent, 21 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 20 percent crystalline gypsum as sand grains and small clusters of crystals; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 25 inches thick)

    By4--46 to 62 inches; reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine tubular pores; disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent, 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 15 percent crystalline gypsum as sand grains and small clusters of crystals; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  Mohave County, Arizona; about 3 miles north of Mt. Trumbull Settlement; 700 feet north and 800 feet east of the southwest corner of section 1, T.35 N., R.10 W.; 36 degrees 27 minutes 28 seconds north latitude and 113 degrees 19 minutes 18 seconds west longitude.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ivanpatch soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 1 to 10 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary formations high in gypsum and calcium carbonate.  Elevations range from 4800 to 6000 feet.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 57 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches.  The frost-free period is 150 to 165 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Barx, Mellenthin, and Tanbark soils.  Barx soils have argillic horizons.  Mellenthin soils are shallow to a lithic contact.  Tanbark soils have gypsic mineralogy and are shallow to gypsic rock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Ivanpatch soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is gyp dropseed, galleta, Indian ricegrass, big sagebrush, juniper, fourwing saltbush, and broom snakeweed.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Arizona.  The series is of limited extent.  MLRA is 35.
