IRAK SERIES

The Irak series consists of very deep, moderately well or somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from reworked eolian material.  Irak soils are in drainageways and draws.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Cumulic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Irak loam in pasture,  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  

    A1--0 to 8 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); abrupt smooth boundary.  (7 to 12 inches thick) 

    C1--8 to 13 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; strong thick platy structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 48 inches thick) 

    C2--13 to 43 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak coarse subangular blocky; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 45 inches thick) 

    C3--43 to 60 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6). 

TYPE LOCATION: Montezuma County, Colorado; about 2 miles west of the community of Yellow Jacket, located about 175 feet east and 750 feet south of the northwest corner of sec. 29, T. 38 N., R. 17 W.; Dolores East, Colorado quad; lat. 37 degrees 36 minutes 56 seconds N. and long. 108 degrees 45 minutes 16 seconds W., NAD27

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil temperature regime: mesic

Mean annual soil temperature: 47 to 52 degrees F

Particle-size control section: 18 to 35 percent clay
with less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser and up to 35 percent very fine sand

Thickness of the mollic epipedon: 20 to 60 inches

Water table: depth is 1 to 3 feet, kind is apparent, months are April to September

A horizon:
Hue: 5YR or 7.5YR
Value: 3 to 5 (2 or 3 moist)
Chroma: 2 or 3
Rock fragments: 0 to 15
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 5 percent

C horizon:
Hue: 5YR or 7.5YR
Value: 3 to 5 (2 to 4 moist)
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: loam or clay loam
Rock fragments: 0 to 15
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 5 percent
Reaction: neutral to moderately alkaline 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ackmen, Alcester, Gabaldon, Muir, Shell, Tobin, and Trementina series.  Potential competitors that do not yet have CEA class assigned are the Coleridge, Hord, Roxbury, and Vega series. Ackmen, Gabaldon, and Vega soils lack a water table from April through September.  Alcester, Hord, Muir, Roxbury, Shell, Tobin, and Trementina soils have 10YR hues in some part of the profile.  Coleridge soils lack carbonates above 40 inches and have a cambic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Parent material: alluvium derived from reworked eolian material

Landform: drainageways and draws

Slopes: 0 to 3 percent

Elevation: 6,200 to 7,400 feet

Mean annual temperature: 46 to 50 degrees F

Mean annual precipitation: 13 to 16 inches

Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year with July and August being slightly wetter and June being slightly dryer.

Frost-free period: 100 to 120 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ackmen, Pulpit, Sharps, and Wetherill series.  Ackmen soils lack a water table from April through September.  Pulpit, Sharps, and Wetherill soils have argillic horizons.  In addition, Pulpit and Sharps soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: moderately well or somewhat poorly drained, negligible to medium runoff, moderate or moderately slow permeability

USE AND VEGETATION: Soils are used for livestock grazing, pasture, crops, and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is alkali sacaton, western wheatgrass, inland saltgrass, and sedges. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwest Colorado.  LRR D, MLRA 36.  This series is of small extent.
