INGERSOLL SERIES

The Ingersoll series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in stratified silty deposits on lake plains, outwash plains, and deltas. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 7.8 degrees C (46 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, semiactive, mesic Aquic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Ingersoll silt loam, on a west-facing, 2 percent slope in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 23 cm (9 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; friable; many fine and medium roots; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. [18 to 25 cm (7 to 10 inches) thick]

 Bt--23 to 30 cm (9 to 12 inches); brown (7.5YR 5/4) silt loam; weak fine angular blocky structure; friable; many fine roots; few dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) organic stains; few thin clay films; common medium prominent gray (10YR 5/1) iron depletions; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary. [8 to 38 cm (3 to 15 inches) thick]

 C1--30 to 38 cm (12 to 15 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine roots; many medium distinct gray (10YR 5/1) iron depletions; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.

 C2--38 to 76 cm (15 to 30 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam and very fine sand; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; few fine distinct gray (10YR 5/1) and grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.

 C3--76 to 86 cm (30 to 34 inches); pink (5YR 7/3) and light gray (5Y 7/1) stratified silty clay loam and silt loam; massive; friable; very few roots; many white (10YR 8/1) carbonate accumulations; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt irregular and broken boundary.

 C4--86 to 152 cm (34 to 60 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam and very fine sand; massive; friable; common medium distinct gray (10YR 5/1) iron depletions; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Midland County, Michigan; 2 miles south and 4 miles east of Edenville; 660 feet east and 330 feet south of the center of sec. 14, T. 16 N., R. 1 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Thickness of the solum: typically 25 to 46 cm (10 to 18 inches), but ranges to 61 cm (24 inches)

Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline

C horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 5Y
Value: 5 to 7
Chroma: 1 to 4
Texture: stratified silt loam, very fine sand, loamy very fine sand, and silty clay loam

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Piccowaxen series. Piccowaxen soils have sola thicker than 61 cm (24 inches) and do not have carbonates within the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ingersoll soils are on lake plains, outwash plains, and deltas of Wisconsinan Age. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. They formed in stratified calcareous silt loam, very fine sand, and silty clay loam containing lenses of finer and coarser texture. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 864 mm (28 to 34 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.7 to 8.9 degrees C (44 to 48 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The Ingersoll soils are associated in the landscape with the poorly drained Colwood and Pella soils, the somewhat poorly drained Dixboro and Kibbie soils, and the moderately well drained Tuscola soils. Dixboro is a coarse-loamy soil and Kibbie has a thicker solum.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION: Ingersoll soils are largely under cultivation. Major crops are corn, field beans, soybeans, sugar beets, hay, and small grain.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 99 in central Michigan. This series is of small extent.
