IZOD SERIES

The Izod series consists of very shallow and shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone and dolomite. Izod soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, mesic Lithic Xeric Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Izod very gravelly loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered by approximately 30 percent gravel.

    A--0 to 8 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate thin platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; many very fine and fine vesicular pores; 40 percent gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 10 cm thick)

    C1--8 cm to 18 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and few fine and coarse roots; common very fine interstitial and tubular pores; 35 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 20 cm thick)

    C2--18 to 33 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, few fine and medium roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 50 percent gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 20 cm thick)

    R--33 cm; fractured limestone; about 50 percent of the bedrock surface area is covered with a 0.3 to 2.5 cm thick carbonate and silica laminae.

TYPE LOCATION:  Elko County, Nevada; about 8 miles southwest of Elko; 2,000 feet north and 2,600 feet east of the southwest corner of section 30, T. 33 N., R. 55 E.; USGS White Flats 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 42 minutes 56 seconds N and longitude 115 degrees 49 minutes 36 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.7155556 latitude,  -115.8266667 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist late fall through early spring, dry June through October; aridic soil moisture regime that borders on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 10 degrees C.
Depth to bedrock: 18 to 36 cm to a lithic contact.
Reaction: Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 40 to 50 percent in the less-than-2-mm fraction; 50 to 60 percent in the less-than-20-mm fraction.
Other features: The lithic contact commonly has laminae of carbonate and silica covering up to 75 percent of the bedrock surface area.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 18 to 25 percent. 
Rock fragments: 40 to 75 percent, mainly gravel.

A horizon  
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3.
Effervescence: Strongly effervescent or violently effervescent.

C horizons  
Value: 6 through 8 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3.
Structure: Weak or moderate subangular blocky or the horizon is massive.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Eaglepass, Kram, Kyler, Logring, Tiki, and Zimbob series.  

Eaglepass, Kram, Kyler, Logring, and Zimbob soils have 8 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Tiki soils have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Izod soils are on hills and mountains. They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone and dolomite. Slopes are 4 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 1,555 to 2,195 meters. The climate is cool-semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chiara, Loomis, and Wedekind soils. Chiara soils are loamy and are shallow to indurated duripans. Loomis soils are clayey-skeletal, very shallow and shallow to hard bedrock, and have argillic horizons. Wedekind soils are loamy, shallow to soft bedrock, and have mollic epipedons and argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; medium or high surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Izod soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is mainly black sagebrush, littleleaf horsebrush, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern and central Nevada. These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRAs 24, 25, and 28B.
