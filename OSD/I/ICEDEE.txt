REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon
*Ochric epipedon
*Cambic horizon--zone from 13 to 38 cm
*Argillic horizon--zone from 48 to 142 cm
*Volcanic glass--zone from 3 to 38 cm
*Andic soil properties--zone from 3 to 38 cm
*Particle-size control section--ashy in zone from 3 to 38 cm; loamy in zone from 38 to 51 cm; clayey in zone from 51 to 104 cm

In the typical pedon, the 2Eb horizon is 13 cm thick but it ranges from 13 to 28 cm thick. This layer is classified as in the loamy particle-size family. Because the 2Eb horizon is 13 cm thick or more, the soil classifies as ashy over loamy. The clayey 2Bt horizon is separated from the ashy part by more than 13 cm. The loamy part is not strongly contrasting to the clayey part; therefore, the soil does not classify as aniso. Base saturation is inferred from laboratory data for the Btree series.
