IVINS SERIES

The Ivins series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy eolian deposits dominantly from sandstone and shale over consolidated volcanic ash material.  The Ivins soils are on desert benches and terraces.  Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy over loamy, mixed, superactive, nonacid, thermic Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Ivins loamy fine sand - rangeland (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 4 inches; red (2.5YR 4/8) loamy fine sand, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; weak thin platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots; few fine tubular and many fine interstitial pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick)

    C1--4 to 24 inches; red (2.5YR 4/8) loamy fine sand; yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; single grained; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine roots; many very fine and few fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (16 to 35 inches thick)

    2Btb--24 to 30 inches; dark red (2.5YR 3/6) sandy clay loam; dark red (10R 3/6) moist; weak medium and coarse prismatic structure; very hard, friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic, few very fine roots; common fine and very fine tubular and few interstitial pores; few thin clay films on faces of peds; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); irregular wavy boundary. (3 to 9 inches thick)

    2Btkb--30 to 39 inches; dark red (2.5YR 3/6) sandy clay, dark red (10R 3/6) moist; moderate medium and coarse prismatic structure; extremely hard, firm, moderately sticky, very plastic; few very fine roots, mostly between peds; common very fine and few fine tubular, and few medium interstitial pores; many thin clay films on faces of peds and in pores; peds are slightly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated and in soft irregular accretions and veins that are strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 12 inches thick)

    2Bkb--39 to 64 inches; red (2.5YR 4/6) and pink (5YR 7/4) sandy clay loam; dark red (2.5YR 3/6) and reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) moist; weak, medium prismatic structure that parts to moderate subangular blocky structure, very hard, firm, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few very fine roots between peds, mostly in upper part of horizon; few very fine tubular pores; occasional stones and cobbles increasing in amount with depth; strongly effervescent, carbonates are present as coatings and lining on peds and in irregular nodules and veins.

TYPE LOCATION: Washington County, Utah; about 1 mile west of Ivins turnoff on highway 91, 150 feet north of road; 1,200 feet north and 200 feet east of the south quarter corner of sec. 6, T.42S., R.16W; Santa Clara Quadrangle; lat. 37 degrees 9 minutes 24 seconds N. and long. 113 degrees 41 minutes 18 seconds W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July-September and December-February.  Driest during May and June. Typic aridic soil moisture regime.

Thickness of A and C horizons: 20 to 39 inches

Mean annual soil temperature: 59 to 67 degrees F.

Mean summer soil temperature: 77 to 82 degrees F.

The C horizon and the upper parts of the 2B horizon are noncalcareous and slightly to moderately alkaline.

A and C horizons
Hue: 2.5YR or 5YR
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 6 through 8.

2B horizon
Hue: 2.5YR or 10R
Chroma: 4 through 8
Texture: sandy clay loam to sandy clay
This horizon has common to many, thin to moderately thick clay films on faces of peds and as bridges between sand grains
Scattered pebbles, cobbles, and stones are in the lower part of this horizon

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ivins soils are on old desert benches or terraces capped with sandy eolian deposits. Elevations range from 2,800 to 3,800 feet. Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent. The mean annual temperature is 57 to 65 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 80 to 84 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 8 to 11 inches and the frost-free period ranges from 170 to 195 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Pintura, Tobler, and Junction soils.  All these soils lack lithologic discontinuities.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; slow runoff; rapid permeability in the upper part and moderately slow to slow in the 2B horizon.

USE AND VEGETATION: The dominant use is rangeland, but small areas are used for irrigated small grains. The native vegetation is Indian ricegrass, sand dropseed, galleta grass, cholla cactus, rabbitbrush, and snakeweed.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Vicinity of Ivins in Washington County, Utah. This soil occurs in LRR-D, MLRA 30.  The series is inextensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: The Virgin River Valley Area, Utah-Arizona, 1936.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features found in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - from a depth of 0 to 4 inches (A horizon).

Buried horizons - the zone from 24 to 64 inches (2Btb, 2Btkb, and 2Bkb horizons).

The soil is classified based on the properties of the sandy mantle.  The family classification is based on the whole soil. The classification fails Psamments because the loamy buried soil occurs within 1 meter.

Classified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999.

Responsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 4/2015. The last revision to the series was 6/2005. ET
