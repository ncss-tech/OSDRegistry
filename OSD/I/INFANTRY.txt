INFANTRY SERIES

The Infantry series consists of soils that are very shallow and shallow to a petrocalcic horizon.  They are well drained soils that are moderately rapidly permeable above and below a very slowly permeable petrocalcic horizon.  They formed in stratified alluvium derived from limestone and modified by eolian sands.  These nearly level to strongly sloping soils are on erosion remnants on fan piedmonts.   Slope ranges from 3 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Phoenix, Arizona.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Otero County, New Mexico; 2001.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section:  The zone from 0 to 10 inches.  (A and Bk horizons)

Ochric epipedon:  The zone from  0 to 2 inches.  (A horizon)

Calcic horizon:  The zone from 2 to 10 inches.  (Bk horizon)

Petrocalcic horizon:  The zone from 10 to 14 inches.  (Bkm horizon)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

The assignment of this soil to an Ustic aridic moisture regime is questioned. This soil is too dry (mean annual precipitation 10 to 12 inches) to be Ustic aridic.
