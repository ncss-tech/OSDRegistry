IXIAN SERIES

The Ixian series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils derived from alluvium derived from mixed rocks over lacustrine sediments.  The Ixian soils are on lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Aquic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ixian silt loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 10 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak thick platy structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine, fine and common medium vesicular pores; violently effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 13 cm thick)

    C--10 to 30 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderate thin platy structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; violently effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.6); clear smooth boundary.  (15 to 50 cm thick)

    Ck--30 to 107 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; many very fine and few fine interstitial pores; few fine seams and soft masses of lime; violently effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (38 to 89 thick)

    2Cy--107 to 122 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; few fine distinct light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) mottles moist; weak thin platy structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine and few fine interstitial pores; common fine seams and soft masses of gypsum; violently effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to 25 cm thick)

    3C--122 to 130 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) discontinuous lens of loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak thin platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine and few fine interstitial pores; violently effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 8 cm thick)

    4Cy'--130 to 160 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silty clay, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; common fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist redox concentrations; weak thin platy structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; many very fine interstitial pores; many silt coats lining pores; common fine and medium seams and soft masses of gypsum; violently effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  Elko County, Nevada; approximately 2 miles west of Montello, about 2,200 feet north of the southeast corner, sec. 16 T. 39 N., R. 69 E.; latitude 41 degrees 15 minutes 41 seconds N and longitude 114 degrees 9 minutes 34 seconds W; NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist in winter and spring, dry in July through October.   The seasonal high water table is at 100 to 150 cm.  It is also subject to short periods of ponding in spring.
Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 15 degrees C.
Depth to lacustrine sediments: 100 to 150 cm.
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  10 to 30 percent.
Other features:  10 to 30 percent durinodes occur below 100 cm in some pedons.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  25 to 35 percent.

A horizon
Hue:  10YR or 2.5YR.
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3. Structure:  Medium or thick platy.

C and Ck horizons
Hue:  10YR or 2.5YR.
Value:  7 or 8 dry
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Texture: Silt loam or silty clay loam with less than 15 percent, fine or coarse sand.
Structure:  Very thin or thin platy or it is massive.

Cy horizons
Hue:  10YR or 2.5YR.
Value:  7 or 8 dry.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Texture:  Stratified silty clay loam to silty clay with thin to thick lenses of loamy fine sand common in most pedons.
Structure:  Platy or is massive.
Redox concentrations:  Few to many, distinct or prominent.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Nilda and Prideen series. 

Nilda and Prideen soils lack secondary carbonates with Bk horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ixian soils are on lake plains.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks over lacustrine sediments.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.   Elevations are 1,435 to 1,710 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm; mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Atreides and Luap series.  Atreides and Luap soils are well drained.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat poorly drained, very slow runoff, moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly black greasewood, iodinebush and inland saltgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.
