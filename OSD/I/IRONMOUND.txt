IRONMOUND SERIES

The Ironmound series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone, or sandstone interbedded with siltstone or shale, of Permian age. These soils are on crests and side slopes of low hills in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slope ranges from 1 to 40 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 16.1 degrees C (61 degrees F), mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 in). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, active, thermic, shallow Udic Haplustepts 

TYPICAL PEDON: Ironmound loam under tame pasture, at an elevation of 305 m (1000 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated).

   Ap--0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 in); reddish brown (5YR 4/4) loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; hard, friable; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine pores; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (Thickness of the A horizon is 10 to 20 cm [4 to 8 in]) 

   Bw--18 to 41 cm (7 to 16 in); red (2.5YR 4/6) loam, dark red (2.5YR 3/6) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine pores; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (Thickness of the Bw horizon is 13 to 36 cm [5 to 14 in]) 

   Cr--41 to 102 cm (16 to 40 in); red (2.5YR 4/6) weathered sandstone, dark red (2.5YR 3/6) moist; neutral.

Darnell soils: have siliceous mineralogy
Dill soils: have bedrock deeper than 51 cm (20 in) 
Loco and Lucien soils: have mollic epipedons

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent Material: sandstone interbedded with siltstone or shale of Permian age 
Landscape: hills

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Coyle, Grainola, Kingfisher, Masham, Piedmont, and Zaneis soils, all of which are greater than 51 cm (20 in) to bedrock. 
Coyle and Kingfisher soils: occur on similar positions
Grainola, Masham, and Piedmont soils: occur on lower side slopes 
Zaneis soils: occur on higher crests and upper side slopes 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage: well drained
Permeability: high
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: moderately rapid
Runoff: negligible on 1 to 3 percent slopes, very low on 3 to 5 percent slopes, low on 5 to 10 percent slopes, medium on 10 to 20 percent slopes, and high on slopes greater than 20 percent

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing. Some of the less sloping areas are cultivated to small grains or tame pasture. Native vegetation consists of short to tall prairie grasses. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Oklahoma; Land Resource Region H; MLRA 80A. The soil is of moderate extent.
