IOSCO SERIES

The Iosco series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in sandy lacustrine deposits or outwash and the underlying loamy lacustrine deposits or till on ground moraines, outwash plains, and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Iosco soils are on ground moraines, outwash plains, and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to about 6 percent. The Iosco soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of sandy lacustrine deposits or outwash and in the underlying loamy lacustrine deposits or till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 813 mm (28 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 5.0 to 7.2 degrees C (41 to 45 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Au Gres, Brevort, Croswell, Menominee, and Rubicon soils. The well drained Menominee soils on higher landscape positions and the poorly drained and very poorly drained Brevort soils on lower landscape positions are in the same drainage sequence with the Iosco soils. The Au Gres soils are sandy throughout and are on similar landscape positions. The moderately well drained Croswell soils and excessively drained Rubicon soils are sandy throughout and are on higher landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm (.5 to 1.5 feet) between September and June in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the upper sandy material and moderately high in the underlying loamy material. Permeability is rapid in the upper sandy material and moderate or moderately slow in the lower loamy horizons.

USE AND VEGETATION: Less than one-half is cropped to corn, hay, oats, potatoes, and vegetables. The greater part is in permanent pasture or forest. Native vegetation is northern hardwoods and pines. Second growth forests are largely quaking aspen. 
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 90A, 93A, 93B, 94A, 94B, 94C, 95A, 96, and 98 in central and northern Michigan, northern Wisconsin, and northern Minnesota. This series is of large extent.
