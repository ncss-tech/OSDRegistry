IDAMONT SERIES

The Idamont series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountains and foothills.  They formed in glacial till with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and moderately rapid below.  Slope ranges from 5 to 65 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is about 35 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy over loamy, glassy over mixed, superactive, frigid Alfic Udivitrands

TYPICAL PEDON:  Idamont ashy silt loam, forested; on a south-facing slope of 25 percent at 2,800 feet elevation.  When described on November 13, 1972, the soil was moist.  Pedon was redescribed on August 16, 1994. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Pend Oreille and Zee series. Pend Oreille soils do not have 2Bw horizons and have less than 50 percent rock fragments in the 2C horizon. Zee soils have 18 to 22 percent clay in the 2Bt horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Idamont soils are on mountains and foothills.  Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent.  They formed in volcanic ash over glacial till derived from granite, gneiss, and schist.  Elevations range from 2,300 to 4,900 feet.  The climate is subhumid with cold, snowy winters and warm, relatively dry summers.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 45 inches.  The average frost-free period is 80 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Dufort, Kriest, Pend Oreille, and Treble soils.  Dufort soils are on southeast and southwest facing mountain slopes, have a xeric moisture regime, and are ashy over loamy-skeletal. Kriest soils are on mountain slopes and have a coarse-loamy control section.  Pend Oreille soils are on mountain slopes and have a volcanic ash mantle less than 20 inches thick.  Treble soils are on south facing mountain slopes, have a xeric moisture regime and are loamy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderate permeability in the upper part and moderately rapid below.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Woodland, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  Natural vegetation is mainly western redcedar, grand fir, western white pine, western larch, and Douglas-fir, with an understory of queencup beadlily, myrtle pachystima, American trailplant, goldthread, sweetscented bedstraw, longtube twinflower, common princespine, and starry false Solomons seal.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Idaho, northwestern Montana, and possibly northeastern Washington.  This soil is moderately extensive.
