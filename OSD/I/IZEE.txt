IZEE SERIES

The Izee series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from shale, sandstone, limestone, and conglomerate with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface.  These soils are north facing slopes in uplands.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Vitrandic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Izee channery ashy loam, range. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 7 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) channery ashy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many roots throughout; many pores; 20 percent channers; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.

    A2--7 to 15 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) channery ashy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many roots throughout; many very fine tubular pores; 20 percent channers; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizon (7 to 20 inches thick)

    2Bw1--15 to 25 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) channery loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common roots throughout; many very fine tubular pores; 25 percent channers; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 12 inches thick)

    2Bw2--25 to 35 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) channery loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few roots throughout; common very fine tubular pores; 25 percent channers fragments; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 12 inches thick)

    2Cr--35 to 38 inches; fractured moderately cemented shale; clear wavy boundary. (2 to 10 inches thick)

    2R--38 inches; indurated shale

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Albee, Goodalfs, Utley, Wallowa, and Wrightman series.  Albee, Wallowa, and Wrightman soils are moderately deep to lithic basalt and do not contain channers.  Goodalfs are very deep.  Utley soils are deep and very deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - Izee soils are on north facing backslopes, footslopes, sideslopes, and headslopes on hills
Slope gradient - 0 to 65 percent
Parent material - colluvium and residuum derived from channery shale, sandstone, limestone, and conglomerate with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface
Elevation - 3400 to 5500 feet
Climate - cold, wet winters and hot, dry summers
Mean annual precipitation - 12 to 16 inches
Mean annual temperature - 39 to 46 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 40 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Gerow, Keerins, Logdell, and Utley soils.  Gerow soils are very deep somewhat poorly drained and occur in drainageways.  Keerins soils are shallow or very shallow and occur on convex crests, nose slopes, and sideslopes.  Logdell soils occur on convex nose slopes and crests and have a base saturation less than 75 percent in one or more horizons.  Utley soils are deep and very deep and occur on toeslopes, footslopes, and baseslopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Izee soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The potential native vegetation is Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, mountain big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, and gray rabbitbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central and East Central Oregon, MLRA 10. This soil is of moderate extent.
