COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: sandy alluvium
Landform: high flood plains
Slopes: 0 to 3 percent
Elevation: 305 to 610 meters (1000 to 2000 feet)
Mean annual temperature: 10 to 12 degrees C. (49 to 54 degrees F.)
Mean annual precipitation: 61 to 81 centimeters (24 to 32 inches)
Frost-free period: 145 to 170 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alda, Barney, Blackloup, Boel, Inavale, Leshara, Platte, and Wann soils.
Alda soils are slightly lower on the flood plain, have a mollic epipedon, have coarse sand or gravelly sand at a depth of 51 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches), and have a wet soil moisture status starting at .46 meters (1.5 feet) (somewhat poorly drained). 
Barney soils are lower on the flood plain, and have a wet soil moisture status starting at the surface or at 15 centimeters (6 inches) (very poorly drained and poorly drained)
Blackloup soils are lower on the flood plain, have a mollic epipedon, and have a wet soil moisture status starting at the surface or at 15 centimeters (6 inches) (very poorly and poorly drained)
Boel soils are slightly lower on the flood plain, and have a wet soil moisture status starting at .46 meters (1.5 feet) (somewhat poorly drained). 
Inavale soils are higher on the flood plain and do not have a wet soil moisture status above 1.8 meters (6 feet) (excessively drained)
Leshara soils are slightly lower on the flood plain, have a mollic epipedon, are fine-silty, and have a wet soil moisture status starting at .46 meters (1.5 feet) (somewhat poorly drained)
Platte soils are slightly lower on the flood plain, have coarse sand or gravelly coarse sand at a depth of 25 to 51 centimeters (10 to 20 inches), and have a wet soil moisture status starting at .46 meters (1.5 feet) (somewhat poorly drained).
Wann soils are slightly lower on the flood plain, are coarse-loamy, and have a wet soil moisture status starting at .46 meters (1.5 feet) (somewhat poorly drained).

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage: moderately well
Runoff: very low
Saturated Hydraulic conductivity: very high
Depth to the apparent seasonal high water table: 91 to 152 centimeters (3 feet) in wet years to about 180 centimeters (6 feet) in dry years. 
Flooding: Rarely flooded

USE AND VEGETATION: About one-half of the Inglewood soils are in native grass used for rangeland. The remaining areas are cultivated with corn and alfalfa being the principle crops.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern and central Nebraska; LRR M, MLRAs 106, 102B; LRR G, MLRAs 65, 66; LRR H, MLRAs 71, 75; The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Saunders County, Nebraska, 1992. The series name is coined.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: 25 to 102 centimeters (10 to 40 inches) (C1, C2, C3 horizons)
Ocrhric epipedon: 0 to 13 centimeters (0 to 5 inches) (Ap horizons)
Redoximorphic concentrations: 76 to 127 centimeters (30 to 50 inches) (C3 and C4 horizons)  
Saturated horizon: water at some period between 50 and 100 centimeters (20 to 39 inches)

Note: These soils were previously mapped with the Inavale or Sarpy soils which do not have an apparent seasonal high water table above a depth of 6 feet. The Sarpy soils are calcareous.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
Added clay content to the "Range in Characteristics" and frost free period to "Geographic Setting" from the Soil Interpretation Record.

1/2004 WAW: Added loamy sand and sand as possible textures to A horizon.  Added rock fragments to Range in Characteristics.  Minor changes made in elevation, MAT, MAP, and frost free days as suggested by Roger Hammer.
Revised Geographically associated soils.

Modified format by LRM in 10/2006 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.
