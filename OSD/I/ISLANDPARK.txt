ISLANDPARK SERIES

The Islandpark series consists of very deep well drained soils occurring on caldera floors and dissected tablelands.  These soils formed in mixed loess and volcanic ash over residuum from basalt.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  Islandpark soils have moderate permeability.  Average annual precipitation is about 24 inches. Average annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Islandpark soils are formed in loess over residuum from basalt.  They are on caldera floors.  The Islandpark soils are on the sideslopes and in the swales.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  Elevations range from 5,900 to 6,400 feet.  Average annual precipitation is 20 to 28 inches, average annual temperature is 37 to 40 degrees F., the frost free period is less than 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Spliten and Potrmound series.  Spliten soils are shallow to hard bedrock and are on basalt plains and terraces.  Potrmound soils have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections, are moderately deep to hard bedrock, have an Umbric epipedon, and are on basalt pressure ridges and domes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Islandpark soils are used for timber production, woodland grazing, recreation, and wildlife habitat.  These soils commonly support lodgepole pine/elk sedge, lodgepole pine/pinegrass, and lodgepole pine/grouse whortleberry community types.  The potential native vegetation is a subalpine fir/grouse whortleberry plant association.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho.  The soils of this series are of large extent.
