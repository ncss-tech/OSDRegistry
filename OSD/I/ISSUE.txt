REMARKS: Issue soils were previously mapped as Iuka, Bibb and Mixed Alluvial miscellaneous areas.
Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 10 cm (Ap horizon)
Cambic horizon--the zone from 10 to 51 cm (Bw and Bg1 horizons)                                                     Aquic conditions--the soil has redox depletions and concentrations within 60 cm of the soil surface, with periodic saturation and reduction at some time during the year
Other soil features identified with this pedon: Irregular organic matter distribution throughout the profile
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 150 cm  

ADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL data is available for the Typical Pedon for the series. Pedon ID S01MD-033-004.  

The 2007 revision adds value of 7 to the Cg horizon range of characteristics and introduces metric units
