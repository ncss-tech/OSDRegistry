IVANELL SERIES

The Ivanell series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material derived from semiconsolidated shale.  These soils are on side slopes on uplands.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ivanell clay loam in grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    E--0 to 3 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate very thin platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick)

    Bt--3 to 7 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and fine angular blocky; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; continuous faint thin clay films on faces of peds and in pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 9 inches thick)

    Btk--7 to 9 inches; light brownish gray silty clay loam (2.5Y 6/2) light yellowish brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; very hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; strongly effervescent; few fine masses of lime; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 4 inches thick)

    Bk--9 to 22 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silty clay loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure; very hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; common fine masses of lime; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 21 inches thick)

    BC--22 to 37 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine pores; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 20 inches thick)

    Cr--37 to 60 inches; semiconsolidated shale that crushes to silty clay loam; few very fine roots in cracks; common fine masses of gypsum; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Rosebud County, Montana, 1985.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT0589.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 3 inches (E horizon); an argillic horizon from 3 to 7 inches (Bt horizon); accumulations of secondary calcium carbonate from 7 to 22 inches (Btk, Bk horizons); a paralithic contact of semiconsolidated shale at 37 inches (Cr horizon).  Ivanell soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
