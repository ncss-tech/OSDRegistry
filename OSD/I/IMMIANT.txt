IMMIANT SERIES



The Immiant series consists of moderately deep to bedrock, well drained

soils on foothills.  They formed in material weathered from volcanic

rocks.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.

The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the average

annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Argixerolls



TYPICAL PEDON:  Immiant gravelly loam - rangeland; on a 16 percent

northwest-facing slope at 4,900 feet elevation.  When described on

September 12, 1980, the soil was moist throughout.  (Colors are for dry

soil unless otherwise noted.)



    A--0 to 10 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR

3/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure parting to very

fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky

and slightly plastic; many medium, fine and very fine roots; many fine

and very fine tubular pores; 20 percent pebbles and stones; neutral (pH

6.9); gradual smooth boundary.  (7 to 17 inches thick)



    Bt1--10 to 20 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly clay

loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse subangular

blocky structure parting to fine subangular blocky; hard, friable,

sticky and plastic; common medium, fine, and very fine roots; many fine

and very fine tubular pores; many moderately thick clay films on ped

faces; 20 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear irregular boundary.

(6 to 12 inches thick)



    Bt2--20 to 28 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) cobbly clay

loam, dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky

structure parting to very fine subangular blocky; hard, friable, sticky

and plastic; many medium, fine and very fine roots; many fine and very

fine tubular pores; many moderately thick clay films on ped faces; 30

percent latite pebbles, cobbles, and boulders; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt

irregular boundary.  (6 to 14 inches thick)



    R--28 inches; weathered latite.



TYPE LOCATION:  Elmore County, Idaho; approximately 10 miles northeast

of Mountain Home, about 2,400 feet north and 2,380 feet east of the

southwest corner of section 7, T.2S., R.8E.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Colma, Dragoon, Duzel, Facey,

Farrot(T), Foehlin, Glenrose, Ladd, Lobitos, Los Gatos, Mehlhorn,

Morical, Taneum, Tieton, Tweedy, and Yaxon series.  Dragoon, Morical,

and Tweedy soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Colma,

Facey, Foehlin, Glenrose, Ladd, Taneum, Tieton, and Yaxon soils are

greater than 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Duzel soils have a average

annual soil temperature of 53 to 59 degrees F and a Bt with a

subhorizon containing more than 35 percent rock fragments.  Farrot

soils contain more than 35 percent sands in the fine earth fraction.

Lobitos soils have a average annual soil temperature of 56 to 59

degrees F.  Los Gatos soils have a average annual soil temperature of

54 to 59 degrees F.  Mehlhorn soils have a Bt with a subhorizon

containing more than 35 percent rock fragments and a reaction that is

slightly acid.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Immiant soils are on foothills at elevations of

4,000 to 5,500 feet.  These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium

derived dominantly from rhyo-dacitic rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 70

percent.  Summers are warm and dry, and winters are cool and moist.

Average annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches, including 1 to 3 feet

of snow.  Average annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F and the

frost-free season is 85 to 105 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brownlee, Ruckles, and

Badge soils.  Brownlee soils are deep.  Ruckles soils are shallow and

clayey-skeletal.  Badge soils are deep and loamy-skeletal.  Brownlee

soils occupy toeslopes or northerly aspects.  Ruckles soils occupy less

sloping wide ridgetops.  Badge soils occupy landscape positions similar

to the Immiant series.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Slow to very rapid runoff;

moderately slow permeability.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The potential

vegetation in the natural plant community is mainly mountain big

sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwest Idaho.  These soils are

inextensive.
