Iyagak soils have an ochric epipedon and occur on similar landforms on swales.
Kikku soils have a histic epipedon, aquic conditions at the soil surface, and occur on similar landforms on backslope positions.
Aklak soils is deep to lithic contact (100 to 150 cm, 40 to 60 in) and occurs on similar landforms on backslope positions.
Niakuk soils have an ochric epipedon, ultra acid to strongly acid reaction classes throughout the profile, and occur on similar landforms on backslope positions.
