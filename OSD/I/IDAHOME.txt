IDAHOME SERIES



The Idahome series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately

permeable, saline soils on fan and high stream terraces.  They formed

in silty alluvium.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The average annual

precipitation is about 10 inches and the average annual temperature is

about 46 degrees F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Haplocalcids



TYPICAL PEDON:  Idahome silt loam -- rangeland.  On a 2 percent single

slope, northeast aspect, 5,200 feet elevation.  (When described June

22, 1982 the soil was dry to 10 inches and moist below.  Colors are for

dry soil unless otherwise noted.)



    A1--0 to 2 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR

4/3) moist; moderate very thick platy structure; slightly hard and very

friable; few very fine roots; many very fine and common fine and medium

vesicular pores; slightly effervescent (4 percent calcium carbonate

equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1

to 4 inches thick)



    A2--2 to 5 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR

4/3) moist; weak very thick platy structure parting to weak fine

subangular blocky; slightly hard and very friable; many very fine

roots; many very fine vesicular pores; strongly effervescent (8 percent

calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear

smooth boundary.  (2 to 10 inches thick)



    Bk1--5 to 10 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, brown

(10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky

structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly

plastic; many very fine, common fine, and few medium roots; many very

fine, fine, and medium tubular pores; strongly effervescent (15 percent

calcium carbonate equivalent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); clear wavy

boundary.  (3 to 10 inches thick)



    Bk2--10 to 18 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) silt loam, pale

brown (10YR 6/3) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky

structure; slightly hard and very friable; many very fine and medium,

and common fine roots; many very fine, fine and medium tubular pores;

violently effervescent (25 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); very

strongly alkaline (pH 9.4); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 inches

thick)



    Bk3--18 to 31 inches; white (10YR 8/2) silt loam, pale brown (10YR

6/3) moist; massive; soft and very friable; few very fine, fine and

medium roots; many very fine, common fine and few medium tubular pores;

violently effervescent (18 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); 15

percent hard and firm cicada krotovinas; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6);

clear wavy boundary.  (7 to 10 inches thick)



    Czk--31 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, brown

(10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard and very friable; few very

fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine and common fine tubular

pores; strongly effervescent (11 percent calcium carbonate equivalent);

few fine irregularly shaped soft seams and filaments of salt;

moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).



TYPE LOCATION:  Cassia County, Idaho; about 2 miles south of Bridge,

Idaho, about 2600 feet east and 1100 feet north of the southwest corner

of sec. 25, T. 15S., R. 26E.



RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:



Average annual soil temperature - 47 to 49 degrees F.

Control section - 10 to 15 percent clay, less than 15 percent coarser

than very fine sand

Depth to the calcic horizon - 5 to 18 inches

Thickness of the calcic horizon - 15 to 28 inches



A horizon

Value - 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist

Chroma - 2 or 3

Calcium carbonate equivalent - 4 to 15 percent

Reaction - moderately or strongly alkaline



Bk horizons

Value - 7 or 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist

Chroma - 2 or 3

Nodules or krotovina - 0 to 20 percent

Calcium carbonate equivalent - 15 to 30 percent



Czk horizons

Value - 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist

Chroma - 2 or 3

Calcium carbonate equivalent - 8 to 12 percent

Reaction - moderately to strongly alkaline



COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bahem, Bram, Nyssaton, Pogal, and

Portino series.  Bahem soils have electrical conductivities of less

than 8 mmhos/cm in the profile.  Bram soils are somewhat poorly

drained, have a fluctuating water table between depths of 3 and 6 feet,

and are moderately slowly permeable.  Nyssaton soils have laminated

lake sediments at depths of 15 to 40 inches and are slowly permeable.

Pogal soils have an average annual soil temperature between 50 and 53

degrees F. and have the upper boundary of the calcic horizon at depths

of 20 inches or greater.  Portino soils have basalt at depths of 20 to

40 inches.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Idahome soils are on nearly level to very gently

sloping fan and high stream terraces. Elevations range from 4,400 to

5,400 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  They formed in silty

alluvium.  The climate is cold and moist in the winter and hot and dry

in the summer.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 12

inches.  The average summer temperature is about 65 degrees F. and the

average annual temperature ranges from 45 to 47 degrees F..  The

frost-free season is about 100 to 130 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Darkbull, Declo,

Mellor, and Strevell (T) soils.  Darkbull soils have a skeletal

particle size control section.  Declo and Strevell (T) soils have

coarse loamy particle size control sections.  Mellor soils have a

natric horizon and are moderately slowly permeable.  All these soils

are on fan terraces.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderate

permeability.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Used primarily for rangeland.  The potential

natural vegetation is mainly black greasewood, bottlebrush

squirreltail, and Sandburg bluegrass.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Idaho.  The series is moderately

extensive.
