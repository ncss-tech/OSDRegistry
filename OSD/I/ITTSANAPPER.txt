Thin strata of sandy and / or finer materials are found in some pedons but are thin enough to maintain particle-size class. 

Some areas are underlain at a depth greater than 100 centimeters by buried fluviomarine deposits with buried albic and spodic horizons.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--Coarse-loamy over clayey estuarine deposits
Landscape--Coastal lagoons
Landform--Lagoon bottoms and lagoon channels
Slope--0 to 1 percent
Mean annual precipitation--970 to 1570 millimeters (38 to 62 inches)
Mean annual air temperature--20 to 25 degrees C (69 to 77 degrees F)
Water salinity range--9 to 29 parts per thousand
Frost-free period--365 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Broadaxe, Endeavor, Mullet, and Tea Hammock soils.

Broadaxe soils--are on submerged wave-cut platforms and have abundant buried and preserved spodic horizons in their fluviomarine deposits.
Endeavor soils--are on relict flood-tidal delta landforms and have sandier textures throughout
Mullet soils--are on washover-fan flat landforms and are sandy textured 
Tea Hammock soils--are also on nearby anthropogenic landforms consisting of dredge deposits shoals

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--Subaqueous
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--Moderately high or high
Soil moisture regime--Peraquic
Soil is continuously inundated by saline and brackish water.

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major uses--Used for recreational boating, fishing, and swimming, marinas, mooring fields, and commercial shellfish harvesting; benthic species include tubeworms, clams, crabs, scallops and juvenile finfish 
Native vegetation--Dominant vegetation is driven by water quality and quantity within subaqueous systems. Under excellent water quality these soils support seagrass species including but not limited to shoal grass (Halodule wrightii), manatee grass (Syringodium filiforme), and star grass (Halophila engelmannii). Under degraded / poor water quality seagrass may be replaced by rooted eukaryotic macroalgae in the green (Chlorophyta), red (Rhodophyta), and brown (Phaeophyta) algae families. Caulerpa prolifera (Chlorophyta) is often dominant. Vegetative cover ranges from 0 through 80 percent.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
General area--Located along the coasts of Indian River Lagoon, Florida
Land Resource Regions--U - Florida Subtropical Fruit, Truck Crop, and Range Region
MLRA(s)--155
Extent--Small
