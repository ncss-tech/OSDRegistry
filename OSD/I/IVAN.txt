IVAN SERIES

The Ivan series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous silty alluvium.  Ivan soils are on flood plains in the Bluestem Hills, MLRA 76.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 910 millimeters (36 inches)and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Cumulic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ivan silt loam on a nearly level flood plain in a cultivated field at an elevation of 356 meters (1165 feet).  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

  Ap--0 to 23 centimeters (0 to 9 inches); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly plastic and slightly sticky; many worm casts; moderately alkaline; abrupt, smooth boundary.

  A--23 to 43 centimeters (9 to 17 inches); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly plastic and slightly sticky; many worm casts; slight effervescence; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (combined thickness of the A horizons is 30 to 66 centimeters (12 to 26 inches) thick)

  AC--43 to 81 centimeters (17 to 32 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly plastic and slightly sticky; many fine worm holes and casts; thinly stratified with very dark brown (10YR 2/2) lenses of silty clay loam in lower part of horizon; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 76 centimeters (0 to 30 inches) thick)

  C--81 to 183 centimeters (32 to 72 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; massive; hard, friable, slightly plastic and slightly sticky; few lenses of grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline.

Allison, Anthon, Huntsville, Judson, Kahola, Kennebec, Kenridge, Lindstrom, Napier, Rossville, Sturkie, and Worthen soils have free carbonates at a depth greater than 25 centimeters (10 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: calcareous silty alluvium
Landform:  flood plains on river valleys
Slopes:  0 to 3 percent

Mean annual air temperature: 12 to 14 degrees C (54 to 58 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 790 to 1020 millimeters (31 to 40 inches)
Precipitation pattern:  Precipitation is usually evenly distributed throughout the year with the exception of November through February being the driest months and May and June being the wettest months.  Summer precipitation occurs during intense summer thunderstorms.
Frost-free period: 170 to 200 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chase, Clime, Florence, Irwin, Reading, Osage and Tully soils. 
Chase and Reading soils are on slightly higher positions.  These soils have an argillic horizon. 
Clime, Florence, Irwin, and Tully are on adjacent uplands.  These soils are more clayey. 
Osage soils are in higher positions on the flood plain and are poorly drained.

10/17/05 JCR LM
Added metric conversion, updated competing series and changed permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.

1/2015 DJK Updated climate data in intro and geographic setting. Added Ap horizon to typical pedon from the Chase County TUD which initially had separated the Ap and A horizons. Added mollic thickness, soil temp. sand content, and rock fragments to RIC. Added slightly alkaline to RIC for A. Changed Ksat to moderately high. Updated Distribution and Extent.
