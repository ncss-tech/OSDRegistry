UVALDE SERIES

The Uvalde series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly or moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous alluvium. These nearly level to gently sloping or gently undulating soils are on stream terraces of piedmont alluvial plains below limestone hills. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 584 mm (23 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 21.7 degrees C (71 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, active, hyperthermic Aridic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Uvalde silty clay loam--pasture.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

Thickness is 15 to 76 cm (6 to 30 in)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include Atco, Bookout, Caid, Chacon, Knippa, Montell, Pryor, Sabenyo, and Valco series.
Atco, Bookout, Pryor, and Sabenyo soils: do not have mollic epipedons 
Caid soils: have argillic horizons 
Valco soils: have petrocalcic horizons 
Chacon and Knippa soils: have vertic properties with COLE values greater than 0.07 
Montell soils: have vertic properties with COLE values greater than 0.07 and have intersecting slickensides. 
All of these soils occur on surfaces similar to Uvalde soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained. Permeability is moderately slow or moderate. Runoff is low on 0 to 1 percent slopes and medium on 1 to 3 percent slopes. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mostly for rangeland and for irrigated vegetables, cotton, corn, and grain sorghum.  Some areas are used for nonirrigated grain sorghum and small grain.  The potential native plant community include grasses such as plains lovegrass, trichloris, Arizona cottontop, pinhole bluestem and plains bristlegrass and they are the dominant vegetation.  Perennial forbs make up about 5 percent of the community and shrubs make up about 3 percent.  With retrogression, plants such as threeawn, curlymesquite, hooded windmillgrass, Hall's panicum, fall witchgrass, and red grama increase or invade and are dominant in most areas.  A wide array of brush plants such as mesquite, guajillo, condalia, paloverde, guayacan, twisted acacia, white brush and pricklypear also increase or invade.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Texas; Land Resource Region: I, Southwest Plateaus and Pains Range and Cotton Region; MLRA: 83A, Northern Riogrande Plain; the series is of large extent.
