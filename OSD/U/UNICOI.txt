MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Monroe County, Tennessee; 1974.

REMARKS:
Unicoi soils formerly were included in the Ramsey series and classified in Lithosols great soil group.  The 12/97 revision placed Unicoi soils in a semiactive CEC activity class.  The 3/99 revision updated the classification to 8th Edition to Keys to Soil Taxonomy (1998) standards and expanded the lower slope range from 8 to 7 percent to facilitate the correlation of Grayson County, Virginia.  Fine sandy loam texture was added to the RIC for the Bw and C horizons.  The 6/00 revision reflects the movement of the official type location from Monroe County, TN to Johnson County, TN.  10/13 revision verifies classification --11th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy.  Note-mineral surface layers typically 3-5 inches thick

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
a.  Ochric epipedon-- the zone from the 0 to 18 cm, 0 to 7 inches (Oe, Oa, A1, and BA horizons) b.  Cambic horizon-- the zone from 18 to 43 cm, 7 to 17 inches (Bw horizon)
c.  Lithic contact--the occurrence of hard bedrock at 43 cm, 17 inches (R horizon)
