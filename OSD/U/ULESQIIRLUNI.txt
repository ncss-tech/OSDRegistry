COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Depth class: very deep
Drainage class: moderately well drained
Landforms: flood plains
Parent material: coarse-silty alluvium
Slope: 0 to 2 percent
Annual precipitation: about 19 inches, 480 mm
Annual temperature: about 28 degrees F., -2 C
Frost-free period: 115 to 146 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These the Maqulluq and Ulet soils.  Maqulluq soils are on sandy terraces and climbing dunes. Ulet soils have sandy strata and are on more frequently flooded positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained and very low runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat and watershed. Native vegetation is *.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 238, Yukon-Kuskokwim Coastal Plains, Alaska. The series is of small extent.
