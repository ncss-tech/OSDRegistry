UNEEDA SERIES

The Uneeda series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey lacustrine sediments of Holocene age over sandy and loamy eolian deposits of late Pleistocene age. These soils occur on concave dune slack depressions of dune fields of the Southern High Plains, Northern Part (MLRA 77A). Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 457 mm (18 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).
