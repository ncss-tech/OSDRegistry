UREAL SERIES

The Ureal series consists of shallow to decomposing tuff, well drained soils formed in residuum and slope alluvium derived dominantly from tuff.  Ureal soils are on mountains and foothills and have slopes of 20 to 50 percent.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-skeletal, glassy, frigid, shallow Vitritorrandic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ureal very cobbly sandy loam on a 35 percent west facing slope at an elevation of 5,600 feet on rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on November 7, 1979, the soil was dry throughout.)

    A1--0 to 7 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak very fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable. nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and common fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 20 percent pebbles and 25 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 10 inches thick)

    A2--7 to 14 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely gravelly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 65 percent pebbles and 25 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.3), clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 11 inches thick)

    Cr--14 to 24 inches; decomposing tuff; few very fine roots to 30 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ureal soils are on mountains and foothills and have slopes of 20 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 5,200 to 7,000 feet.  The soils formed in residuum and slope alluvium derived dominantly from tuff.  The climate is cold and moist in winter and spring and dry in summer.  Average annual precipitation is 11 to 13 inches.  Average summer air temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F.  Average annual air temperature is 37 to 41 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 45 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dacont, Dawtonia, Gaciba, and Zeebar soils on mountains and foothills.  The Dacont, Dawtonia, and Zeebar soils are very deep.  The Gaciba soils are lithic and have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; permeability is moderately rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland.  Vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central Idaho.  These soils are not extensive.
