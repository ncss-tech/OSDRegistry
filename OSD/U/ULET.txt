COMPETING SERIES: This Eielson series. Eielson series has visible in the soil profile.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Depth class: very deep
Drainage class: somewhat poorly drained
Landforms: flood plains
Parent material: sandy and silty alluvium over sandy alluvium
Slope: 0 to 3 percent
Annual precipitation: about 19 inches, 480 mm
Annual temperature: about 28 degrees F.,-2 C
Frost-free period: 115 to 146 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ulesqiirluni and Maqulluq soils. Ulesqiirluni soils are deep silty soils on floodlplains. Maqulluq soils are on sandy terraces and climbing dunes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained and very low runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high to very high in the upper part of the  soil profile and low in the lower party of the underlying layers.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat and watershed. Native vegetation is *.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 238, Yukon-Kuskokwim Coastal Plains, Alaska. The series is of small extent.
