UNIVEGA SERIES

The Univega series consists of very shallow and shallow over an indurated duripan, well drained soils. The soils formed in alluvium derived from quartzite and volcanic rocks. Univega soils are on fan piedmonts. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Typic Haplodurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Univega gravelly fine sand--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

   A1--0 to 3 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly fine sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few fine interstitial pores; 25 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 8 cm thick) 

   A2--3 to 10 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak thin platy structure parting to weak fine subangular blocky; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and medium, few coarse roots; common fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 13 cm thick)

    Bw--10 to 33 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) fine sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and medium, few coarse roots; common fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 38 cm thick)

    2Bqkm1--33 to 46 cm; white (10YR 8/1) fractured, indurated duripan, light gray (10YR 7/2) moist; massive; very hard, few fine roots in fractures; interbedded strong to weak cementation within indurated lamella, violently effervescent; clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 13 cm thick)

    2Bqkm2--46 to 107 cm; white (10YR 8/1) indurated duripan, light gray (10YR 7/2) moist; massive; very hard; violently effervescent; gradual wavy boundary.  (50 to 90 cm thick)

     3Bqk--107 to 152 cm; white (10YR8/1) gravelly coarse sand, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; few fine interstitial pores; 20 percent gravel; common moderately thick carbonate and silica pendants on underside of rock fragments; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  Nye County, Nevada; approximately 1,100 feet west of Coyote Hole Spring and about 2,000 feet south and 2,500 feet west of the northeast corner of section 14, T. 2 N., R. 47 E.; USGS Stone Cabin Ranch SW 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 1 minutes 29 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 41 minutes 0 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.0245556 latitude, -116.6833333 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in some parts in winter and early spring and for 10 to 20 days in the upper part of the profile during July to September following convection storms; typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 15 degrees C.
Depth to duripan: 20 to 50 cm.
Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 8 to 18 percent.
Rock fragments:  0 to 15 percent, mainly gravel.

A horizon
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3 dry and moist.

Bw horizon
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4 dry and moist.
Consistence: Nonsticky to slightly sticky.
Structure:  Platy or subangular blocky.
Texture:  Fine sandy loam or sandy loam.
Clay content:  8 to 18 percent.
Rock fragments:  0 to 15 percent, mainly gravel.

Bqkm horizon
Silica cementation:  Interbedded strong and weak cementation with thin continuous indurated laminae.

Bqk horizon
Value:  7 or 8 dry, 6 or 7 moist.
Chroma:  1 or 2 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Texture:  Coarse sand or sand.
Rock fragments:  15 to 35 percent, mostly gravel.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Garhill, Sodhouse and Tybo series. 

Garhill soils have hard bedrock within 76 cm.  Sodhouse has a gravelly cambic and a mean annual soil temperature that ranges from 8 to 12 degrees C.  Tybo has a calcic horizon above the duripan.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Univega soils are on fan piedmonts. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 1,525 to 2,075 meters.  The climate is warm and arid with mean annual precipitation of 150 to 200 mm; mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 110 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Stumble and Jevets soils.  Stumble soils lack a duripan.  Jevets soils have a duripan below 50 cm and have a sandy control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, slow to medium runoff; moderately rapid permeability; high saturated hydraulic conductivity above the pan.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing.  The vegetation is mainly fourwing saltbush, littleleaf horsebrush, spiny hopsage and galleta.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Nevada.  MLRA 29. These soils are not extensive.
