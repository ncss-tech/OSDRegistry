UTICA SERIES

The Utica series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils formed in alluvium or colluvium derived from limestone. These soils are on stream terraces, outwash fans and escarpments. Slopes are 0 to 35 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, carbonatic, frigid Typic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Utica gravelly loam - native grass (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 6 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak coarse and fine granular structure; soft, friable; many fine roots; many fine and medium interstitial] pores; 20 percent gravel; strongly  effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick)

    Bk--6 to 19 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; few tubular pores; common fine roots; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 40 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; some cementation of sand and small gravel to undersides of cobbles; prominent stalactites on undersides of gravel, all gravel coated with lime; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear boundary. (5 to 20 inches thick)

    2C--19 to 72 inches; loose sand and gravel, 70 percent by volume coarse gravel and cobbles with 30 percent sand; calcareous with lime coats on undersides of gravel and cobbles, decreasing with increased depth; moderately alkaline.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Lincoln County (Star Valley) Wyoming, 1943.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to 7 inches mixed (A and part of the Bk horizon); 
Calcic horizon - the zone from 6 to 19 inches (Bk horizon); 
Lithologic discontinuity - at 19 inches (2C horizon); 
Particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (part of the Bk and the 2C horizon). 

Utica soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
