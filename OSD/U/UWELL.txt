UWELL SERIES

The Uwell series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks over lacustrine sediments. The Uwell soils are on alluvial flats, inset fans and lake plains. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Duric Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Uwell silt loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 8 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate thin and medium platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and common medium roots; common fine interstitial and tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 10 cm thick)

    Bk--8 to 41 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and common medium roots; common fine interstitial pores; few weak durinodes; 10 percent gravel; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary. (25 to 40 cm thick)

    2Bqk--41 to 66 cm; pale yellow (5Y 8/2) silt loam, pale olive (5Y 6/3) moist; weak to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine, very fine, and medium roots; common fine tubular and interstitial pores; few carbonate filaments and soft masses, common fine and medium durinodes; 5 percent gravel; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (20 to 30 cm thick)

    3B'k1--66 to 122 cm; light olive gray (5Y 6/2) silty clay loam, olive (5Y 5/3) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine, very fine, and medium roots; common fine tubular pores; few fine mottles; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (28 to 84 cm thick)

    3B'k2--122 to 152 cm; light olive gray (5Y 6/2) silty clay, olive (5Y 5/3) moist; strong medium and coarse prismatic structure parting to strong medium angular blocky; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Batan and Boton series.

Batan and Boton soils have a typic aridic soil moisture regime,

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Uwell soils are on alluvial flats, inset fans and lake plains. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks over lacustrine sediments. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations are 1,860 to 1,910 meters. The climate is cool, semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C.; and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Pyrat and Sheffit series. Pyrat soils have more than 35 percent gravel in the particle-size control section and Sheffit soils have more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained; slow runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail and winterfat.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East Central Nevada. These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 28B.
