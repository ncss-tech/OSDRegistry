MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Queen Anne's County, Maryland, 1995. 

REMARKS: 
This soil was formerly included in the Sassafras series. It is distinguished from Sassafras by having a particle size control section that is coarse-loamy rather than fine-loamy, and a seasonal high water table between 102 and 183 centimeters (40  and 72 inches) which will affect its use. 

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 28 centimeters (0 to 11 inches) (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 46 to 89 centimeters (18 to 35 inches) (Bt1 and 2Bt2 horizons)
Aquic conditions--the zone from 130 to 201centimeters
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 152 centimeters (0 to 60 inches)
