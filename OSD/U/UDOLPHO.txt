UDOLPHO SERIES

The Udolpho series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils that formed in 50 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) of silty or loamy sediments and the underlying sandy and gravelly outwash.  These soils are on linear or concave slopes on outwash plains, valley trains, stream terraces, and glaciated uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 790 millimeters (about 31 inches).  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (about 48 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Mollic Endoaqualfs

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are cultivated.  The principal crops are corn and soybeans.  Most cultivated areas are artificially drained or water table has been lowered by drainage of nearby soils.  The native vegetation is mixed big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, other grasses of the tall grass prairie and mixed deciduous trees.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 33 centimeters (0 to 13 inches) (Ap and E horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 33 to 69 centimeters (13 to 27 inches) (Btg1,and Btg2 horizons);
abrupt textural change--at the upper boundary of the 2Cg horizon;
aquic moisture regime--matrix chroma of 2 or less with redoximorphic concentrations.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
