ULA SERIES

The Ula series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone.  Ula soils are on mountain foot slopes and side slopes and have slopes of 2 to over 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 640 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Ustollic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ula cobbly sandy loam - forested.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 3 cm; undecomposed oak leaves and pine needles.

    A--3 to 16 cm; reddish gray (5YR 5/2) cobbly sandy loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; 10 percent cobbles, 10 percent pebbles; common medium and coarse roots; neutral; clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 20 cm thick)

    E--16 to 34 cm; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) cobbly sand loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; slightly hard, very friable; 5 percent stones, 10 percent cobbles, 10 percent pebbles; common medium and coarse roots; neutral; gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 25 cm thick)

    Bt1--34 to 47 cm; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) cobbly sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky; 5 percent stones, 10 percent cobbles, 10 percent pebbles; common medium and coarse roots; few faint clay films in fine tubular or interstitial pores; neutral; gradual wavy boundary. 

    Bt2--47 to 88 cm; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) cobbly sandy clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium blocks; very hard, friable, sticky and plastic; 5 percent stones; 10 percent cobbles, 10 percent percent pebbles; common medium and coarse roots; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of Bt horizons - 30 to 70 cm)

    BC--88 to 98 cm; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) cobbly sandy clay loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) crushed moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, slightly sticky; 5 percent stones, 10 percent cobbles, 10 percent pebbles, few coarse roots; few faint clay films on faces of peds; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (5 to 15 cm thick)

    Cr--98 to 123 cm; weathered conglomerate sandstone.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Amerant (WY), Beardal (UT), Bramard (ID), Dunlatop (CO), Hub (WY), Nisula (ID), Rimton (WY), Stringam (ID), Swapps (UT), Telcher (ID), and Wix (CO) series.

Bramard, Dunlatop, Hub, Nisula, Stringam, and Telcher soils lack a paralithic contact above a depth of 100 cm.  Amerant has mean summer soil temperature of more than 8 degrees C.  Beardal and Swapps soils have a lithic contact above a depth of 100 cm.  Rimton soils have a mixed E/B horizon and have hue yellower than 5YR in all horizons.  Wix soils have hues of 10YR and yellower in the Bt horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform--mountain foot slopes and side slopes
Elevation--2375 to 3050 meters
Slope--2 to over 60 percent
Parent material--residuum weathered or reworked from sandstone
Mean annual precipitation--460 to 710 mm
Mean annual air temperature--3 to 6 degrees C

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderate permeability

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for timber production, wildlife habitat, and limited grazing.  Vegetation is mainly ponderosa pine, white fir and aspen with an understory of kinnikinnick, mountain muhly, junegrass, mountain brome, and Gambel oak.
