UPTON SERIES 

The Upton series consists of soils that are shallow to a petrocalcic horizon, well drained, and moderately permeable.  They formed in gravelly, calcareous loamy slope alluvium and/or colluvium derived from limestone and marl.  These soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping footslopes or fans of ridges on dissected plateaus.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 381 mm (15 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 19.4 degrees C (67 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, carbonatic, thermic, shallow Calcic Petrocalcids 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Upton gravelly loam--rangeland.
     (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.) 

    A--0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 in); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; many fine roots; 20 percent hard calcium carbonate gravel, mostly less than one inch diameter; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (Thickness is 10 to 30 cm [4 to 12 in].) 

    Bk--13 to 33 cm (5 to 13 in); pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable; common fine roots; 25 percent hard calcium carbonate gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (Thickness is 15 to 40 cm [6 to 16 in].) 

    Bkkm--33 to 53 cm (13 to 21 in); pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) caliche; indurated in upper two inches, strongly cemented below; many imbedded limestone gravel; calcareous, clear smooth boundary.  (Thickness is 10 to 91 cm [4 to 36 in].) 

   BCk--53 to 203 cm (21 to 80 in); pink (7.5YR 8/4) caliche; very gravelly loamy earth; very weakly cemented; 40 percent limestone gravel, few cobbles and stones.

Crossen soils: have moist values in the A horizon of 2 or 3 and occur in MLRA 42.
Conger soils: are moist for longer periods of time and  have mixed mineralogy. 
Shumla soils: have mixed mineralogy and have limestone bedrock within 102 cm (40 in).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

USE AND VEGETATION:  Almost wholly in rangeland of low carrying capacity.  Native rangeland has a sparse cover of shortgrasses such as gramas, tridens, and threeawns and widely spaced creosotebush, cedar, and mesquite. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Edwards Plateau (MLRA 81A), West Texas (MLRA 42) and New Mexico (MLRA 70).  The series is extensive.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Particle size control section: 0 to 33 in. (A and Bk horizon) 
Ochric epipedon - 0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 in)  (A horizon) 
Calcic horizon - 13 to 33 cm (5 to 13 in)  (Bk horizon).  It is not required for the series.
