UTSALADY SERIES


The Utsalady series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in sandy glacial outwash. Utsalady soils are on broad flat summits and toeslopes. Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 830 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Utsalady soils are on broad flat summits and toeslopes of narrow ridges with elevations from 10 to 100 meters. They formed in sandy glacial outwash. These soils are in a mild marine climate with cool, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 625 to 1,150 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C. Frost-free season is 200 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Elwha, Uselessbay, Indianola, and Sholander soils.  Elwha soils are coarse-loamy and occur on convex slopes on summits at higher elevations above 100 meters and have a densic contact at 50 to 100 cm (moderately deep). Indianola soils occur on convex hill slopes and terraces and lack redoximorphic features. Uselessbay soils are on convex slopes on summits and ridges and are 50 to 100 cm (moderately deep) to a densic contact. Sholander soils are in concave positions and have redoximorphic features beginning at 18 to 46 cm (somewhat poorly drained).

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; Saturated hydraulic conductivity is very high or high throughout. Utsalady soils may have an apparent water table as high as 75 centimeters from December to March.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for livestock grazing, forage crop production, timber production, and homesites. Potential natural vegetation consists of western hemlock, Douglas-fir, western redcedar, bigleaf maple, swordfern, red huckleberry, evergreen huckleberry, salal, oceanspray and trailing blackberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Washington; MLRA 2, North. Series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Island County, Washington, proposed 2009. The name is from a town on Camano Island

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Albic horizon  the zone from 3 to 5 cm (E horizon)
Ochric epipedon
Particle size control section - the zone from 25 to 100 cm (within the Bw1, Bw2, and Bw3 horizons)
Depth to redoximorphic features - 79 cm (top of the Bg horizon)
Oxyaquic subgroup  79 cm to faint redox concentrations, assumed saturated for 30 or more cumulative days

This Utsalady series is being proposed for a low relief, striated glacial landscape that occurs in southern Island County and northern Kitsap County. In the Kitsap County Soil Survey the Ragnar series was mapped on similar landforms. Ragnar is similar but coarse loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and lacks redoximorphic features and saturation. The Utsalady series concept has potential to replace Ragnar in areas of Kitsap County. Investigation is needed to determine if the Ragnar series concept may be better suited for the eastern margin of the Puget lowlands (parts of King, Pierce, and Snohomish Counties)
