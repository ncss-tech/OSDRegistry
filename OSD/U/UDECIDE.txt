UDECIDE SERIES 

The Udecide soils consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, or residuum derived from weakly consolidated siltstone, loamstone, and sandstone.  These soils are on alluvial fans, interfluves, hills, knolls, escarpments, strath terraces and sedimentary plains.  Slopes are 2 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Gallatin County, Montana, 1997; proposed in Jefferson County, Montana, 1993.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1585, MT1611.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the surface to 9 inches (A, Bt1 horizons); an argillic horizon from 5 to 14 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizons); horizons of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation from 14 to 28 inches (Bk1, Bk2 horizons); weakly consolidated sandstone bedrock at 28 inches (Cr horizon); a particle-size control section from 5 to 14 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizons). Udecide soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
