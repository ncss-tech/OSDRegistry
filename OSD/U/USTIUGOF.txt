USTIUGOF SERIES

The Ustiugof series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in silty, sandy, and gravelly marine deposits on coastal plains. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 610 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 0.6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed Typic Cryaquents

TYPICAL PEDON: Ustiugof silt loam, located on a coastal plain talf with a slope of 1 percent and elevation of 5 meters; when described on September 17th, 2007 the soil was wet from 32 to 183 cm (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted)

 A--0 to 20 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam; 15 percent sand; 78 percent silt; 7 percent clay; massive; friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots, many medium roots, and common coarse roots; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary

 Cg1--20 to 32 cm; dark gray (2.5Y 4/1) silt loam; 35 percent sand; 61 percent silt; 4 percent clay; massive; friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots, common medium roots, and few coarse roots; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt smooth boundary

 2Cg2--32 to 183 cm; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) extremely gravelly sand; 95 percent sand; 3 percent silt; 2 percent clay; single grain; loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots, few medium roots, and few coarse roots; 68 percent nonflat 5 to 75 millimeter fragments, 2 percent nonflat 2 to 5 millimeter fragments; noneffervescent; moderately acid (pH 6.0)
