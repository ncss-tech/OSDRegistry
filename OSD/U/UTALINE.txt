UTALINE SERIES

The Utaline series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvial and colluvial materials derived from basalt.  Utaline soils are on mesas, high terraces, and fan remnants.  Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Utaline cobbly loam in grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    A1--0 to 4 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/4) cobbly loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium granular structure, weak platy structure in surface two inches; 30 percent basalt cobbles moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)

    ABk--4 to 9 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/4) very cobbly loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; 50 percent basalt cobbles; calcium carbonate as soft concretions; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick)

    Bk1--9 to 18 inches; pink (7.5YR 8/4) very cobbly loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable; 50 percent basalt cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary.

    Bk2--18 to 40 inches; pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) very cobbly loam, pink (7.5YR 7/4) moist; massive; slightly hard; friable; 75 percent basalt cobbles; violently effervescent; calcium carbonate in finely divided form; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); diffuse wavy boundary. 

    Bk3--40 to 60 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) very cobbly loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable; 80 percent basalt cobbles; strongly effervescent; calcium carbonate in finely divided form. (Total thickness of the Bk horizons is 30 to 54 inches)

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Delta county, Colorado (Lower Colorado Area), 1970.  

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 9 inches.  (A and ABk horizons)
Calcic horizon:  The zone from 4 to 60 inches.  (ABk, Bk1, Bk2, and Bk3 horizons)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
