COMPETING SERIES: These are no series in this family.  When a series is established, this series placeholder will be dropped (see REMARKS).
 
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loess and alluvium
Landform: floodplains, terraces, and mountain drainages
Slope: 0 to 4 percent
Mean annual temperature: 28 to 30 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 15 to 18 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Ulet and the Ulesqiirluni soils on similar landforms. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained. Low to medium runoff. Permeability is moderate.
 
USE AND VEGETATION: Used for subsistence and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is typical of Boreal scrub and grass, subalpine forest and scrub, and tundra sedge.
 
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 229 - Interior Alaska Lowlands; MLRA 230 - Yukon-Kuskokwim Highlands; and MLRA 238- Yukon-Kuskokwim Coastal Plain, Alaska. The soil is extensive.

SERIES PROPOSED: The Western Interior Rivers Area, Alaska, 2007

REMARKS: This series is set-up as a placeholder to allow the use of a short family name.  The range in characteristics is broader than a typical series and may even encompass the full range of the family.  There are currently no series designated in this soil family.

Diagnostic features and horizons recognized in this profile include:
Mineral horizons: from 4 to 60 inches.
Temperature regime: Cryic
Moisture regime: Aquic
Cambic horizon: 4 to 18 inches
Redox features: 18 to 60 inches
