URLAND SERIES

The Urland series consists of deep, well drained soils.  These gently sloping to moderately steep soils formed in stratified sandstone and clayey coastal plain sediments of Pleistocene Age mainly on the Willis Formation.  Slope ranges from 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C (67 degrees F); mean annual precipitation is about 1321 mm (52 in).
