REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features in this pedon
*Mollic epipedon--zone from 0 to 81 cm
*Cambic horizon--zone from 46 to 107 cm; oriented clay, but no increase in content of clay from overlying horizon
*Particle-size control section--zone from 25 to 100 cm
*Vitrandic feature--zone from surface to a depth of 46 cm

This series is correlated to the PIPO/AGSP habitat type.

5/2000--The classification was changed from coarse-loamy, mixed, mesic Pachic Haploxerolls to coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Vitrandic Haploxerolls based on a revision to Soil Taxonomy.

This pedon does not meet the criteria for an argillic horizon because there is no increase in the content of clay from the A horizon to the 2Bt1 horizon.

The discontinuity at the 2Bt1 horizon represents the limit of the vitrandic feature and the influence of airfall volcanic ash and loess. 

The 3Btkb horizon, where present, has been correlated to a clayey substratum phase.

6/2016--This official series description (OSD) was updated as part of the final correlation of the Spokane County, Washington, soil survey. The formatting was updated according to SSR1 Technical Note 11--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015).
