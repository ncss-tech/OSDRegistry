UZACOL SERIES

The Uzacol series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived from shale.  Uzacol soils are on toeslopes and footslopes of hills.  Slopes range from 3 to 9 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Vertic Natrargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Uzacol clay loam, on a 7 percent slope in native vegetation at an elevation of 5,500 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The surface is covered by 1 percent stones and 5 percent gravel.

    A1--0 to 1 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) clay loam with about 1 percent stones on the surface, reddish brown (5YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; 5 percent gravel and 1 percent stones; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick)

    A2--1 to 5 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/3) moist; weak thick platy structure parting to moderate medium granular; slightly hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 4 inches thick)

    Btn1--5 to 16 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) clay, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky and angular blocky; very hard, very firm, very sticky and moderately plastic; common faint clay films on the faces of peds and in pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); gradual smooth boundary. (6 to 14 inches thick)

    Btn2--16 to 26 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) clay, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very firm, very sticky and moderately plastic; common faint clay films on the faces of peds and in pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); gradual smooth boundary. (6 to 14 inches thick)

    Btn3--26 to 31 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) clay, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) moist; weak to moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common faint clay films on the faces of peds and in pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 6 inches thick)

    Bkn--31 to 45 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) clay, light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) moist; weak to moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; 10 percent gravel; few fine soft masses of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 20 inches thick)

    Bky--45 to 59 inches; pink (5YR 7/4) clay, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine subangular blocky; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; 10 percent gravel, many fine soft masses of gypsum and calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).  (0 to 20 inches thick) 

    Cr--59 inches; soft shale or sandstone.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Aguilar (CO), Churchill (NV) and Final (OR) series.  Aguilar, Churchill and Final soils are very deep.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 

Parent material: Slope alluvium over residuum derived from Morrison shale.

Landform: Footslopes and toeslopes of hills.

Slopes: 3 to 9 percent

Elevation: 5,000 to 5,700 feet

Mean annual temperature: 52 to 56 degrees F.

Mean annual precipitation: 8 to 10 inches.

Frost-free period: 135 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Zwicker and Claysprings series. Zwicker and Claysprings soils are found on hills, knobs, and ridges and are usually located in geographically higher positions.  Uzacol soils are normally in the footslope or toeslope position.  Rock outcrop is also common in areas of Uzacol soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: well drained, high runoff, slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Uzacol soils are used for wildlife habitat and livestock grazing.  The present vegetation is shadscale, alkali sacaton, prickly pear, and galleta

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwest Colorado.  LRR D, MLRA 35.  This series is of small extent.
