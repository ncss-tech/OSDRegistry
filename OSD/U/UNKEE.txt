UNKEE SERIES

The Unkee series consists of very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  They are in playas.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Chromic Haplotorrerts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Unkee clay loam, rangeland - on a 1 percent slope, at 4,370 feet elevation.  (When described on August 18, 1993, the profile was dry throughout.  Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Oe--0 to 1 inch; organic matter, decomposing plant roots intermixed with root mat. (0 to 2 inches thick)

    A--1 to 8 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; strong fine to medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and medium roots; few fine and medium tubular pores; cracks 3/4 to 1 inch wide and about 6 to 8 inches apart; slightly effervescent (8 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Bss1--8 to 47 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clay, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderate medium angular wedge-shaped and blocky peds and irregular vertical fractures; many slickensides 4 to 5 inches apart; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine roots; few fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; cracks 1/4 to 3/4 inch wide and about 4 to 6 inches apart; strongly effervescent (5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. (32 to 45 inches thick)

    Bss2--47 to 67 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clay, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderate coarse angular wedged-shaped blocky peds; many slickensides 4 to 5 inches apart; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; 5 percent gravel; slightly effervescent (5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

TYPE LOCATION:  Minidoka County, Idaho; about 3.8 miles north of Norland, Idaho; about 1,400 feet west and 100 feet south of the northeast corner of section 5, T.7S., R.23E.; Latitude - 42 degrees, 50 minutes, 57 seconds North;  Longitude - 113 degrees, 40 minutes, 20 seconds West.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  The Day and Agerdelly series in a closely related family are very-fine.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Unkee soils are in playas.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  The soil formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Elevation ranges from 4,100 to 4,500 feet.  The average annual precipitation is about 8 to 10 inches. The average annual air temperature is about 47 to 49 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Paulville and Power soils.  The Paulville and Power soils are not fine textured.  Paulville and Power soils occur on higher terraces.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; frequent ponding; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Unkee soils are used for rangeland.  The native vegetation is three-tip sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass and sedges.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Idaho.  This series is of small extent.
