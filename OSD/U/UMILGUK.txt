COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bandarrow, Habenome (OR), Fourlog, Venapass (WY), and Rosane (CO & WY) series.
Bandarrow soils do not have a reduced matrix anywhere in the profile.
Habenome soils have buried A horizons and occur on basins and benches on glaciated mountain slopes.
Fourlog soils have many mica flakes in the substratum.
Venapass soils has stratified textures in the substratum and occur at 2,150 to 2,600 m (7,000 to 8,500 ft) elevation.
Rosane soils have sand and gravel textures at depths below 60 to 100 cm (24 to 39 in).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Tuttu soils have an umbric epipedon, andic soil properties, and occur on mountain slopes on backslope and footslope positions.
Cilla soils have an ochric epipedon, a cambic horizon, and occur on similar landforms on backslope positions.
