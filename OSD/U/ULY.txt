ULY SERIES

The Uly series includes very deep, well drained formed in loess on uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 10 degrees C. (50 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 53 centimeters (21 inches) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Uly silt loam with a slope of about 12 percent in rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

   A--0 to 25 centimeters (0 to 10 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak fine granular; slightly hard, friable; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (15 to 30 centimeters (6 to 12 inches) thick)

   BA--25 to 38 centimeters (10 to 15 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches) thick)

   Bw--38 to 53 centimeters (15 to 21 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium and fine subangular blocky; hard, friable; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (15 to 30 centimeters (6 to 12 inches) thick)

   BC--53 to 64 centimeters (21 to 25 inches); light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches) thick)

   C--64 to 203 centimeters (25 to 80 inches); very pale brown (10YR 8/2) silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Custer County, Nebraska; about 18 kilometer (11 miles) south and 1.6 kilometer (1 mile) west of Broken Bow; 46 meters (150 feet) north and 46 meters (150 feet) west of southeast corner of sec. 26, T. 15 N., R. 21 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture control section: moist in some part from October through April; intermittently moist from May through July; driest in July through September
Depth to secondary carbonates: 18 to 51 centimeters (7 to 20 inches) and extends into the B horizon in some pedons
Thickness of the mollic epipedon: 30 to 76 centimeters (12 to 30 inches), but is deeper in some pedons
Thickness of the solum: 30 to 91 centimeters (12 to 36 inches)
Particle size control section (weighted average):
Clay content: 18 to 29 percent

A horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 3 to 5, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 2
Texture: silt loam but very fine sandy loam and loam are included
Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline

Bw horizon:  (Bk horizon if present)
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 4 to 7, 2 to 5 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: silt loam and in some pedons silty clay loam
Reaction: slightly acid to moderately alkaline

C horizons:
Hue: 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y
Value: 4 to 8, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: silt loam or very fine sandy loam
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bend, Homme and Nuckolls soils.  
Bend soils have varves at depths less than 102 centimeters (40 inches).  
Homme soils contain more clay in the upper part of the B horizon and formed in glacial sediments.  
Nuckolls soils have redder hue and are deeper to free carbonates.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: thick deposits of calcareous loess  
Slope: 7 to 15 percent but range from 0 to 30 percent  
Mean annual precipitation: 46 to 61 centimeters (18 to 24 inches)  
Mean annual temperature: 7 to 14 degrees C. (45 to 57 degrees F.)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Agar, Coly, Hobbs, Holdrege, Hord, and Lowry soils. 
Agar soils have an argillic horizon and are on similiar landscapes.  
Coly soils lack a mollic epipedon and are on upland side slopes.  
Hobbs soils are stratified above a depth of 25 centimeters (10 inches) and formed in alluvium on flood plains.  
Holdrege, Lowry and Nuckolls soils are on similar landscape positions.  
Hord soils are on stream terraces.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage: well drained  
Runoff: low to very high depending on slope 
Saturated hydraulic conductivity:   moderately high

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of the acreage of these soils is in native grass.  
Big bluestem, little bluestem, sideoats grama, blue grama, and western wheatgrass are the dominant species.  
Cultivated areas are cropped mainly to corn, winter wheat, sorghum, and alfalfa.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Nebraska, south-central South Dakota, and north-central Kansas.  The soil is extensive.
