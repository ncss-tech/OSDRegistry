UENDAL SERIES

The Uendal series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from sandstone.  Uendal soils are on hillslopes.  Slopes range from 4 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Ustic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Uendal gravelly sandy loam, on an east facing, concave, 6 percent slope in Wyoming big sagebrush rangeland at an elevation of 5,800 feet.  The surface is covered by 40 percent subangular gravel and 10 percent channers.

    A--0 to 4 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak thin platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine vesicular pores; slightly effervescent, (5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated; 20 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)

    C1--4 to 16 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots; few very fine interstitial pores; slightly effervescent, (8 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated; 10 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.

    C2--16 to 24 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and medium, and common fine roots; few very fine interstitial pores; slightly effervescent, (10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated; 10 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth boundary.  (combined thickness of C horizons ranges from 18 to 34 inches thick)

    R--24 inches; unweathered sandstone bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Uintah County, Utah; about 6 miles southwest  of Rainbow, Utah on the USGS Archy Bench S.E. Quadrangle; located about 2,200 feet west and 300 feet south of the northeast corner of sec. 35, T.11S., R.23E., SLBM; lat. 39 degrees 49 minutes 24 seconds N. and long. 109 degrees 18 minutes 30 seconds W., NAD 27

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture:  The soil moisture control section is affected by precipitation that falls evenly throughout the year with a slight increase in late summer and early fall.  Aridic moisture regime bordering on ustic.
Mean annual summer soil temperature:  47 to 51 degrees F.
Surface rock fragments:  25 to 50 percent channers and gravel from sandstone.
Depth to lithic contact:  20 to 40 inches to sandstone bedrock.

Particle-size control section:  8 to 15 percent clay; 0 to 15 percent angular gravel and channers from sandstone.

A horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR
Value:  5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma:  3 or 4 dry or moist
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 5 to 15 percent.
Reaction: moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline

C horizon:
Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y
Value:  6 to 8 dry, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma:  3 or 4 dry or moist
Texture:  sandy loam or fine sandy loam
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent angular sandstone gravel and channers.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 5 to 15 percent.
Reaction:  moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline 

COMPETING SERIES:  Current competitors are the Cliff, Keeline, Oterodry, Turnercrest, and Yarts series.  Competitors prior to the Seventh Edition, 1996 Keys to Soil Taxonomy are the Councelor, Gilston, Henrieville, Nelson, Pedrick, Shedado, and Zia series.

Cliff, Councelor, Gilston, Henrieville, Keeline, Oterodry, Pedrick, Yarts, and Zia:  are more than 60 inches deep.

Nelson and Turnercrest:  have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches in depth.

Oterodry: have accumulations of secondary calcium carbonate and have soil moisture control sections that are affected by peak periods of precipitation from April through August.

Shedado:  have hues redder than 7.5YR.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium derived from sandstone.
Landform:  hillslopes.
Slopes:  4 to 8 percent
Elevation: 5,200 to 6,300 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  45 to 49 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  8 to 12 inches.
Frost-free period:  110 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Casmos, Hickerson, Motto, and Walknolls series.  

Casmos, Motto, and Walknolls soils occur on hillslopes and are shallow to bedrock.

Hickerson soils occur on alluvial flats and are very deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, low runoff, moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Major uses are rangeland, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  Potential native plant community is Wyoming big sagebrush, spiny hopsage, rubber rabbitbrush, Indian ricegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, bluegrass, and horsebrush.  This soil has been correlated to Semidesert Gravelly Sandy Loam (Wyoming Big Sagebrush) - 034XY206UT range site in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Utah.  LRR D, MLRA 34.  This series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Uintah County, Uintah Area Soil Survey, Utah, 1998.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 24 inches.  (C1 and C2 horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 4 inches.  (A horizon)
Carbonates in the profile are considered primarily geogenic, and not secondary accumulations.
Lithic contact:  The contact with sandstone bedrock at 24 inches.  (R layer)

The cation exchange activity class was inferred from laboratory data in the Uintah Area Soil Survey.

The surface texture modifier was determined following the guidelines outlined in the Utah document, "Procedures for Distributing Rock Fragments on the Surface Layer into the Upper 6 inches of Soil and Subsequent Naming of Map Units, April 1979."

Taxonomic Version:  Eighth Edition, 1998.

The Nelman series is in the process of being reclassified to an Aridic Ustic soil moisture regime and should not be considered a competitor to the Uendal series.
