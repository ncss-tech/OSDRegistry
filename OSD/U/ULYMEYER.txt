ULYMEYER SERIES

The Ulymeyer series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in  alluvium derived from granitic rock.  Ulymeyer soils are on alluvial fans and fan terraces. Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Xeric Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ulymeyer very gravelly loamy coarse sand - on a 7 percent north slope at 1,525 meters in elevation under blackbrush, big sagebrush, and Douglas rabbitbrush vegetation.  Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.  When described October 12, 1978, the soil was dry throughout. Surface coverage of rock fragments; 3 percent boulders, 5 percent stones, 10 percent cobbles, and 25 percent gravel.

    A--0 to 30 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loamy coarse sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and common fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent stones and boulders, 5 percent cobbles, and 25 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); abrupt wavy boundary.  (8 to 36 cm thick)

    C1--30 to 69 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very stony loamy coarse sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 20 percent stones and boulders, 25 percent cobbles, and 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.9); abrupt wavy boundary.  (20 to 50 cm thick)

    C2--69 to 152 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely stony loamy coarse sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 25 percent stones and boulders, 20 percent cobbles, and 20 percent gravel, slightly acid (pH 6.5).

TYPE LOCATION:  Inyo County, California.  About 2.5 miles south-east of Rovana in Round Valley; 30 feet northeast of dirt power line road; 1,100 feet south and 2,350 feet east of the northwest corner of section 33, T.6 S., R.31 E., M.D.B.M., Rovana quadrangle; latitude 37 degrees 23 minutes 15 seconds N and longitude 118 degrees 34 minutes 46 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 37.3875000 latitude, -118.576666 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Soil moisture: Usually dry from about May 30 to November 15, and are usually moist in some or all parts the rest of the time; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 14 to 15 degrees. 
Depth of the soil: 152 cm or more.   
Reaction: Slightly acid or neutral.
Other features: Rock fragments tend to be rounded or have rounded edges.  The surface rock fragment coverage ranges from 30 to 60 percent with 3 to 15 percent boulders, 5 to 20 percent stones, 1 to 20 percent cobbles, and 20 to 30 percent gravel.  Some boulders exceed 180 cm in diameter.  

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 3 to 10 percent.
Rock fragments: 35 to 80 percent, with 10 to 50 percent boulders and stones, 10 to 25 percent cobbles, and 5 to 25 percent gravel.

A horizon
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 2 through 4.
Organic carbon content: 0.3 to 0.6 percent.

C horizons 
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y.
Value: 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist 
Chroma: 2 through 4 dry, 2 through 4 moist.
Textures: Very stony loamy coarse sand or extremely stony loamy coarse sand.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alderdale, Burbank, Crunkvar, Denio, Doowak, Sheeprock, Skaha and Wrango series.  

Alderdale are moderately deep. Burbank, Doowak, Sheeprock and Wrango soils are effervescent in some or all parts and have Ck or Ckq horizons.  Crunkvar soils have mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 14 degrees C. Denio soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 10 to 11 degrees C. Skaha soils have soil temperatures of 8 to 13 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ulymeyer soils formed on alluvial fans and fan terraces.  Many of these fans and fan terraces are part of long aprons along mountain range fronts.  They are dissected with some shallow washes and drainageways.  Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,465 to 1,955 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm; mean annual temperature is 8 to 12 degrees C; and the frost-free season is 130 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Haar Family, Rovana, and Bairs soils.  Haar family soils are shallow loamy soils over granitic bedrock on hillsides and mountain plateaus.  Rovana soils have sandy particle-size control sections on alluvial fans and fan terraces.  Bairs soils have argillic horizons and are on bouldery alluvial fans and fan terraces.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; slow runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used principally for grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation is mainly big sagebrush and desert needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East of the Sierra Nevada in eastern California.  The soils are of moderate extent.
