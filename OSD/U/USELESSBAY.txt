USELESSBAY SERIES


The Uselessbay series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in sandy glacial outwash over dense glacial drift. Uselessbay soils are on summits and side slopes of narrow ridges. Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 830 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, isotic, mesic Oxyaquic Dystroxerepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Uselessbay gravelly sandy loam, on a north facing 6 percent slope. When described on September 4, 2008, the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Uselessbay soils are on summits and shoulders of narrow ridges with elevations from 10 to 100 meters. They formed in sandy glacial outwash over dense glacial drift. These soils are in a mild marine climate with cool, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 625 to 1150 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C. Frost-free season is 200 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Elwha, Utsalady, Indianola, and Sholander soils.  Elwha soils are coarse-loamy and occur on convex slopes on summits at elevations above 100 meters.  Indianola soils occur on convex hill slopes and terraces and have a sandy control section, lack a densic contact and redoximorphic features. Utsalady soils are on concave and broad flat summits and lack a densic contact. Sholander soils are in concave positions have redoximorphic feature beginning at 20 to 46 cm (somewhat poorly drained).

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained; Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high to very high in the A, Bw, C, and Cg horizons, and low in the Cd horizons. Uselessbay soils have a perched water table as high as 30 centimeters from December through March.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for livestock grazing, forage crop production, timber production, and homesites.  Potential natural vegetation consists of western hemlock, Douglas-fir, western redcedar, bigleaf maple, swordfern, red huckleberry, evergreen huckleberry, salal, oceanspray and trailing blackberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Washington; MLRA 2, North. Series is of small extent.
