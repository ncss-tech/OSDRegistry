UMBO SERIES

The Umbo series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly and moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from quartzite, sandstone, shale and limestone rocks.  Umbo soils are on alluvial flats.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Oxyaquic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Umbo clay loam on a east facing 1 percent slope under irrigated pasture at an elevation of 5,280 feet.  (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 8 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine, common fine roots; many very fine, common fine, few medium tubular pores; strongly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 10 inches thick)

    C1--8 to 20 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4); weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine, common very fine roots; common very fine, few fine and medium tubular pores; strongly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary.  

    C2--20 to 30 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay loam, very pale brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine, few fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; few very fine and fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary.

    C3--30 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loam, pale brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine, few fine tubular pores; common fine and very fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; strongly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

TYPE LOCATION:  Uintah County, Utah; located about 1.5 miles northwest of Vernal; 700 feet south, 1,500 feet west of the northeast corner of Sec. 21, T.4S., R.21E., SLBM; USGS Vernal N.E., Utah quadrangle; 40 degrees, 27 minutes, 39 seconds north latitude and 109 degrees, 33 minutes, 43 seconds west longitude; NAD 027.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  

Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section is affected by precipitation that falls throughout the year, with a slight increase in late summer and fall. The soil moisture regime is typic aridic.
Mean annual soil temperature ranges: 47 to 51 degrees F. 
Depth to endosaturation: 20 to 60 inches to irrigation induced saturation during the months of April to December.

Particle-size control section: 18 to 35 percent clay

A horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR to 2.5Y
Value: 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4
Textures: clay loam or silty clay loam
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  3 to 15 percent
EC(mmhos/cm):  0 to 16
Gypsum: 0 to 1 percent
Reaction: moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline

C horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR to 2.5Y
Value: 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4
Textures: clay loam, loam, sandy loam, and silty clay loam. 
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  3 to 15 percent
EC(mmhos/cm):  0 to 16
Gypsum: 0 to 3 percent
Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  Current competitors are the Mikett and Parohtog series. A previous competitor, prior to the Seventh Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, is the Rustigate soils.   

Mikett soils have an aridic bordering on ustic soil moisture regime.
Parohtog soils have hue redder than 7.5YR.
Rustigate soils have mean annual soil temperatures greater than 51 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: alluvium derived from quartzite, sandstone, shale and limestone
Landform: alluvial flats
Slopes: 0 to 4 percent
Elevation: 4,600 to 5,600
Mean annual air temperature: 45 to 47 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 5 to 8 inches
Frost-free period: 110 to 125 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Blackston, Nolava, Shotnick, Tipperary and Turzo series.  Nolava soils are on fan remnants and have a calcic horizon.  Shotnick soils are on similar position and have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections.  Tipperary soils usually occur as hummocks or dunes and have sandy particle-size control sections.  Blackston soils are dominantly on fan remnants and have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections.  Turzo soils are on similar positions and do not have irrigation induced endosaturation.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly and moderately well drained; negligible to low runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally for irrigated cropland.  Principal crops grown are alfalfa, alfalfa-grass, small grains, and pasture grasses.  It is also used for rangeland, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  This soil has been correlated to the Wet Saline Meadow (Inland Saltgrass) - 034XY024UT range site at the type location is Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Utah; LRR D; MLRA 34.  The series is of small extent.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches. (C1, C2, and C3 horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from the soil surface to a depth of 8 
inches.  (A horizon)
