UVER SERIES

The Uver series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, rapidly permeable soils formed in  alluvium derived from quartzite and sandstone.  Uver soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 1 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, siliceous, mesic Oxyaquic Torrifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Uver loam -- rangeland.  (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 6 inches;  brown (7.5YR 5/4) loam; dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak very fine subangular blocky; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, common medium, few coarse roots; common very fine and fine, few medium tubular pores; 5 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; common fine distinct reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8) redoximorphic concentrations; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 9 inches thick).

    Bk1--6 to 15 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely cobbly loamy sand; dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, common fine and medium, few coarse roots; common very fine and fine, few medium tubular pores; calcium carbonate is segregated as few veins and very thin coats on underside of rock fragments; 35 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; few fine distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) redoximorphic concentrations; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 9 inches thick).

    Bk2--15 to 37 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely cobbly sand; brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; very slightly effervescent, calcium carbonate is disseminated and segregated as very thin coats on the undersides of rock fragments, (1 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); 35 percent gravel, 35 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); gradual smooth boundary.  (17 to 31 inches thick).

    C--37 to 60 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely cobbly sand; brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine, few medium roots; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; 35 percent gravel, 35 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones; common fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) redoximorphic concentrations; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9).

TYPE LOCATION:  Uintah County, Utah; 4 miles north of Fort Duchesne on the Fort Duchesne USGS quadrangle; 1,700 feet north, 800 feet west of the southeast corner of sec. 34 , T.1S., R.2E., USBM; 40 degrees, 21  minutes, 3 seconds north latitude and 109 degrees, 51  minutes, 42 seconds west longitude.  NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section is affected by precipitation that falls evenly throughout the year with a slight increase in the late summer and fall.  The soil moisture regime is Aridic bordering on Ustic.
Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 51 degrees F.
Depth to secondary carbonates: 6 to 9 inches.
Depth to redoximorphic concentrations: 6 to 9 inches.
Depth to endosaturation:  20 to 40 inches to meltwater induced saturation during the months of March through July.

Particle-size control section (weighted average): less than 10 percent clay and 65 to 80 percent rounded rock fragments.

A horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 2 through 4 dry or moist
Reaction: neutral to moderately alkaline

Bk horizon:
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 2 through 4 dry or moist
Texture: extremely cobbly loamy sand or extremely cobbly sand

C horizon:
Hue: 5YR or 7.5YR
Value: 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 3 or 4 dry or moist
Texture: extremely cobbly loamy sand or extremely cobbly sand
Reaction: neutral to moderately alkaline

These soils do not meet the combination of color and thickness to qualify for a mollic epipedon.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: alluvium derived from quartzite and sandstone
Landscape: flood plains
Slope: 1 to 4 percent
Elevation: 4,700 to 6,400 feet 
Mean annual air temperature: 45 to 49 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 7 to 12 inches
Frost-free period: 110 to 140 days
 
GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Heapo, Paradox and Robido soils. Heapo soils are on stream terraces and have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections.  Paradox soils are on alluvial flats and have fine-loamy particle-size control sections.  Robido soils are on floodplains and have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; very low runoff;   rapid permeability; occasionally flooded March through July for very long duration.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally for rangeland, woodland, wildlife habitat, irrigated pasture, and recreation.  Potential vegetation consists of bluegrass, wheatgrass, coyote willow, basin big sagebrush, rubber rabbitbrush, narrowleaf cottonwood, and ponderosa pine.  This soil has been correlated to the Semiwet Streambank (Narrowleaf Cottonwood) - 034XY019UT range site at the type location in Utah. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Utah.  LRR D, MLRA 34.  The series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Uintah County, Uintah Area Soil Survey, Utah 1998.  The name is coined from the Uinta River.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (Bk1, Bk2 and C horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 6 inches. (A horizon)
Secondary calcium carbonate:  The zone from 6 to 37 inches.  (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)
Redoximorphic concentrations:  The zones from 6 to 15 inches and 37 to 60 inches.  (Bk1 and C horizons)
Endosaturation:  The presence of meltwater induced saturation at depths of 20 to 40 inches during the months of March through July.

The pedon is assumed to have an irregular decrease in organic carbon.

Siliceous mineralogy is based on laboratory data from the associated Heapo soil.
