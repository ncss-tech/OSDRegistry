UVA SERIES

The Uva series consists of well drained soils that are shallow to sandstone bedrock. Uva soils have moderately rapid permeability and are formed in eolian material derived from sandstone and shale on summits and shoulders of undulating plateaus.  Slopes are 3 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches. Mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Lithic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Uva loamy fine sand-forestland. (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.)

     Oi--0 to 1 inch; needles and twigs.  (0 to 2 inches thick)

     A--1 to 3 inches (1 to 8 cm); brown (10YR 5/3) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to granular; soft, loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and coarse roots; many fine and very fine irregularly shaped pores; 15 percent gravel 10 percent cobbles;  neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. (1 to 4 inches thick)

     Bt1--3 to 6 inches (8 to 16 cm); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, loose, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common medium, fine, and very fine roots; many fine and very fine irregular pores; 5 percent gravel; common distinct and faint clay films and clay bridging; neutral (pH 6.6); diffuse smooth boundary.  

     Bt2--6 to 9 inches (16 to 23 cm); yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) paragravelly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and very slightly plastic; common fine, and very fine roots and few medium roots; many fine and very fine irregular pores; 20 percent paragravel; common faint clay films and clay bridging; neutral (pH 6.6); slightly effervescent; clear smooth boundary.  (combined Bt horizons are 5 to 15 inches thick)

     Btk--9 to 17 inches (23 to 43 cm); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; violently effervescent, carbonates segregated as common very fine irregularly shaped masses on faces of peds (5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick)

     R--17 to 27 inches; very strongly cemented sandstone bedrock

TYPE LOCATION: Santa Fe County, New Mexico; about 3.5 miles south of the Glorieta Conference Center; USGS Glorieta 7.5 minute Topographic Quadrangle.  Latitude 35 degrees 31 minutes 51.60 seconds north and Longitude 105 degrees 46 minutes 10.66 seconds west; 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Typically, the soil moisture control section (SMCS) is moist in all parts from January to May and intermittently moist in some part from June to December. It is moist in all parts less than 40 percent of the time (cumulative), when the soil temperature at 20 inches is above 41 degrees F. The soil moisture regime is typic ustic. 

Soil temperature 48 to 50 degrees F.
Depth to bedrock: 10 to 20 inches.
Particle-size control section:  Contains 8 to 18 percent clay

A horizon 
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 to 4
Rock Fragments: 5 to 20 percent gravel; 0 to 10 percent cobbles; 0 to 2 percent stones; 0 to 1 percent boulders.

Bt horizons 
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 to 6 dry, 4 to 6 moist.
Chroma: 3 to 8
Texture: sandy loam, paragravelly sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, or cobbly sandy loam.
Rock Fragments: 0 to 20 percent gravel; 0 to 10 percent paragravel; 0 to 10 percent cobbles; 0 to 2 percent stones; 0 to 1 percent boulders

Btk horizon
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 to 6 dry, 4 to 6 moist.
Chroma: 3 to 8
Rock Fragments: 0 to 5 percent gravel; 0 to 5 percent paragravel; 0 to 10 percent cobbles; 0 to 2 percent stones; 0 to 1 percent boulders

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Arabrab (NM), Atarque (NM), Pescado (NM), Simitarq (NM), Valena (AZ), and Verite (AZ) series. The Arabrab, Atarque, Pescado, Simitarq, and Valena soils all have an aridic ustic moisture regime and do not support ponderosa pine trees.  The Verite series has 15 to 30 percent clay and less sand in the particle-size control section, and hues that are more yellow.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Uva soils occur on summits and shoulders of undulating plateaus over Triassic Age sandstone bedrock. Slopes are 3 to 15 percent. Average annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 16 inches. Average annual temperature is about 46 to 48 degrees F., and the average frost-free period is about 120 to 140 days. Elevation ranges from 6,200 to 8,000 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Herrada, Sabroso, Verano, Dondiego, and Chacuaco soils.  Dondiego, Herrada, Sabroso, and Verano soils are very deep; Chacuaco soils are moderately deep with a calcic horizon. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for wood products, livestock grazing, recreation, and wildlife. Present vegetation is pinyon pine, ponderosa pine, Rocky Mountain juniper, blue grama, and muttongrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Uva soils are of small extent on the northern Glorieta Slope part of the Pecos Valley section of the Great Plains physiographic province in northcentral New Mexico. The MLRA is 70A.

SERIES PROPOSED: Santa Fe Soil Survey update, 2006.  The original series name Urraca was changed to Uva because there was another established series with a similar name.  Uva is a place name and the spanich word for grape.  

REMARKS: 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - 1 to 3 inches (A horizon). When colors meet the requirements of a mollic epipedon, the horizon is less than 4 inches thick.
Argillic horizon - 3 to 17 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and Btk horizons).
Lithic contact - 17 inches (top of R layer).
