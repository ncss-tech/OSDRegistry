REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon
*Particle-size control section--zone from 5 to 105 cm
*Umbric epipedon--zone from 5 to 38 cm
*Cambic horizon--zone from 38 to 150 cm
*Andic soil properties--zone from 5 to 150 cm

06/2016--Assumed to meet criteria 2 (no ash required) for andic soil properties, in the 12th edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy. It is also assumed that enough ash is present for the soils to meet criteria 3. Additional lab data is needed to confirm the degree of ash influence.

Dense till was observed between depths of 100 and 150 cm in some areas of Uppersoda soils in the Willamette National Forest.
