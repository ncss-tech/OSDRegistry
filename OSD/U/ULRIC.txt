ULRIC SERIES

The Ulric series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium over residuum derived from interbedded shale and sandstone. These soils occur on hills. Slopes are 3 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 340 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 5.5 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Torrertic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Ulric loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 16 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots throughout; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 10 percent subangular gravel; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 18 cm thick)

    Btk--16 to 47 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to strong fine subangular blocky; moderately hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots throughout; common very fine and fine dendritic tubular pores; 10 percent subangular gravel; 30 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 8 percent fine distinct irregular carbonate masses in matrix, and finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (20 to 45 cm thick)

    BCk--47 to 84 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) paragravelly clay, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots throughout; few very fine and fine dendritic tubular pores; 25 percent weakly cemented angular paragravel; 4 percent medium distinct irregular carbonate masses in matrix, and finely disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (20 to 60 cm thick)

    Cr--84 cm; weakly cemented calcareous shale bedrock.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Ulric soils are primarily used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The potential native vegetation may include early sage, Hood's phlox, and thickspike wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Ulric soils are of small extent in southwestern Wyoming. MLRA - 34A.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES PROPOSED: Lincoln County, Wyoming, 1974.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - 0 to 16 cm (A horizon)
Argillic horizon - 16 to 47 cm (Btk horizon)
Secondary calcium carbonate accumulation - 16 to 84 cm (Btk, BCk horizons)
Paralithic contact - 84 cm
Particle-size control section - 16 to 47 cm (Btk horizon)

Ulric soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
