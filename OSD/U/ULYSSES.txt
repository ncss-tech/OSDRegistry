ULYSSES SERIES

The Ulysses series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess. Ulysses soils are on plains, rises, and hillslopes on tableland in the Central High Tableland (MLRA 72). Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 480 millimeters (19 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Buffalo Park, Colby, Keith, and Richfield soils.
Buffalo Park soils are eroded Ulysses that do not have a mollic epipedon, and are on similar positions. 
Colby soils do not have a mollic epipedon or a cambic horizon and are on steeper side slopes or convex ridges.  
Keith and Richfield soils have argillic horizons and are typically on broader, less sloping adjacent plains.

Native vegetation is short and mid grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Kansas, western Nebraska, southeastern Wyoming, southwestern South Dakota, and eastern Colorado. LRR H, Major Land Resource Area 72; Central High Tableland. The series is of large extent.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by lab sample numbers: 40A1811, 40A1813, 40A1814, 88P0864, 89P0137, 89P0727, 89P0734, 90P0719, 91P0807, 91P0809, 91P0810, 91P0811, 95P0481, 95P0482, 95P0486, and 14N0264.
Taxonomic version: Twelfth Edition, 2014.
Some soils formerly classified in the Ulysses series have free carbonates in the lower part of the mollic epipedon and throughout the cambic horizon. These soils would now be classified as Torriorthentic Haplustolls. ELF 09/1997
Modified format by LRM in 1/2006 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.
Modified format by DEW in 12/2011 to meet MO5 standards.
Removed the calcareous modifier from the parent material description. TDC 04/2012
Changed the subgroup classification from Aridic Haplustolls to Torriorthentic Haplustolls because 83 percent of the true Ulysses pedons are in the Torriorthentic Haplustolls subgroup. TDC 04/2016
Changed the taxonomic version to the Twelfth Edition. TDC 04/2016
Moved the type location to represent the new subgroup and to place it more toward the center of the Ulysses extent. TDC 04/2016
Edited the Range in Characteristics for the horizons, based on statistics from 683 true Ulysses pedons. TDC 04/2016
Free carbonates are allowed within 18 centimeters of the soil surface, but the effervescent strength is noneffervescent to slightly effervescent. TDC 04/2016

Edited Mean Annual Precipitation and Frost Free Days values, based on NOAA data (1981-2000). TDC 04/2016
Added Buffalo Park to the associated soils list. TDC 04/2016
Expanded the low end of the Runoff range from low to negligible to represent the areas with slope less than 1 percent, based on NSSH 618-49 (2003). TDC 04/2016
Added lab sample numbers that support the assignment of the cation-exchange activity class. TDC 04/2016
KSSL lab pedon IDs that support the Ulysses series are 03N0884, 05N0784, 14N0264, 40A1811, 40A1813, 40A1814, 87P0017, 87P0026, 87P0029, 88P0864, 89P0137, 89P0727, 89P0734, 89P0737, 89P0741, 90P0719, 91P0807, 91P0809,91P0810, 91P0811,95P0481, 95P0482, and 95P0486. TDC 04/2016
Some soils formerly classified in the Ulysses series do not have free carbonates in the lower part of the mollic epipedon or throughout the cambic horizon. These soils would now be classified as Aridic Haplustolls and are considered part of the Ulysses family. TDC 04/2016
Removed Oklahoma from the extent because Ulysses major components have been removed from that state. TDC 04/2016
