UBAJ SERIES

The Ubaj series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in colluvium and/or outwash derived from granodiorite over lacustrine deposits. The Ubaj soils are on lake terrace. Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 685 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cavendish, Kaiders, Martis, Teanaway, Wafla, and Wintoner soils.  None of the competing series are described as overlying lacustrine material. In addition, Cavendish has paralithic contact at 40 to 60 inches and is derived from basalt.  Kaiders is derived from basalt and has gravels in the lower part. Martis has gravels in the lower part and has volcanic parent material.  Teanaway is at elevations less than 762 meters and has a frost free period of greater than 80 days and has a base saturation of 55 to 75 percent.  Wafla is overlying weathered basalt at 100 to 178 cm and Wintoner lacks free water in the profile and is at elevations less that 701 meters.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Ubaj soils are on outwash plains and terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and/or outwash derived from granodiorite over lacustrine deposits. Elevation is 1895 to 1990 meters. The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cold wet winters. The mean annual precipitation is 580 to 990 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C. The frost free season is 40 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Jabu and Christopher soils. The Jabu soils are coarse-loamy and do not have lacustrine materials and the Christopher soils are sandy and do not have an argillic horizon or lacustrine deposits.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained, moderate permeability above and slow within the lacustrine deposits, medium runoff. During spring runoff water moving through the profile is slowed down on top of the lacustrine material. Perched water table is at 50 to 100 cm for brief periods during spring snow melt.  Ubaj soils are not flooded or ponded.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation wildlife and urban development. Vegetation is white fir and Jeffrey pine with an understory of green leaf manzanita, whitethorn ceonothus, and mahala mat.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Ubaj is of minor extent in California in MLRA 22A -- Sierra Nevada Mountains
