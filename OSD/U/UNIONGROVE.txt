Crowriver--are on slightly higher landscape positions on rims and flats of depressions and have carbonates within a depth of 10 centimeters
Grovecity--are on higher landscape positions and have a frequently saturated zone between depths 0.75 and 1.2 meters during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Lundlake--are on lower landscape positions in depressions and have a mollic epipedon greater than 60 centimeters thick
Swedegrove--are on landscape positions similar to those of the Uniongrove soils and have carbonates in all parts between depths of 25 to 50 centimeters

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class--poorly drained--in an undrained condition, these soils are frequently saturated from the surface of the soil to a depth of 0.3 meter during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--10.00 to 100.00 micrometers per second

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are artificially drained and cropped intensively to corn and soybeans. Small grain and hay are other major crops. Reed canarygrass commonly dominates partially drained pasture. Native vegetation is predominantly wet-site tall prairie species such as prairie cordgrass, switchgrass, big bluestem, wooly sedge, giant goldenrod and Canada goldenrod.
