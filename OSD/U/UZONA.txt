UZONA SERIES

The Uzona series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in stream and slope alluvium derived from shale and sandstone.  Uzona soils are on hills, stream terraces, and fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  

Parent material:  stream and slope alluvium derived from shale and sandstone

Landform:  stream terraces, fans, and hills

Slopes:  0 to 12 percent

Elevation: 5,000 to 6,000 feet

Mean annual temperature:  52 to 57 degrees F

Mean annual precipitation:  6 to 11 inches

Frost-free period:  130 to 160 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Polacca and Wepo soils on stream terraces.  Both soils have cambic horizons, also Polacca soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, medium to very high runoff, very slow or slow permeability  
A seasonal high water table occurs below 60 inches in some pedons.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for livestock grazing.  Vegetation is alkali sacaton, galleta, western wheatgrass, fourwing saltbush, shadscale, saline wildrye, bottlebrush squirreltail and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Arizona and southwest Colorado.  LRR D, MLRA 35.  This series is of small extent.
