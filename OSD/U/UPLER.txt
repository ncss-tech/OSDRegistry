UPLER SERIES

The Upler series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks. Upler soils are on terrace remnants and hillslopes. Slopes range from 1 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Calciustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Upler very gravelly loam, rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The surface is covered by about 34 percent gravel and 12 percent cobbles.

       A--0 to 3 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine tubular pores; 36 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; calcium carbonate is disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick)

       Bw--3 to 9 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and few very fine roots; many fine and very fine tubular pores; 30 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; calcium carbonate is disseminated; 9 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 7 inches thick)

       Bk1--9 to 25 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) extremely gravelly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine interstitial pores; 60 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; calcium carbonate is disseminated and occur as coatings on all sides of rocks; 18 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (14 to 26 inches thick)

       Bk2--25 to 35 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) extremely gravelly loamy sand, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; massive; loose, loose, non-sticky and non-plastic; few fine and very fine roots; 60 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; calcium carbonate is disseminated and occur as coatings on all sides of rocks; 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; clear wavy boundary. (10 to 28 inches thick)

       Bk3--35 to 60 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/4) extremely gravelly loam, reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) moist; massive; loose, loose, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; 60 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent; calcium carbonate is disseminated and occur as coatings on all sides of rocks; 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. (15 to 25 inches thick)

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Buckndoe (AZ), Chicosa (CO), Katzine (AZ), Saraton (CO), Tinaja (NM), Twobutte (KS), and Yatne (UT) series.
Buckndoe soils have petrocalcic horizon, are in the ustic aridic soil moisture regime and have mean annual soil temperature that range from 54 to 56 degrees F.
Chicosa soils have a soil moisture control section that is moist intermittently April through August and dry October through February.
Katzine soils have 5YR hues.
Saraton soils contains marl, has Bk horizon, and averages 18 to 35 percent clay.
Tinaja soils average 18 to 30 percent clay, and lack Bw horizon.
Twobutte soils are moderately deep to hard caliche bedrock and occur on Central High Tablelands (MLRA 72).
Yatne soils have 18 to 27 percent clay.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: alluvium and colluvium derived from sedimentary rocks
Landform: terrace/pediment remnants, hillslopes
Slopes: 2 to 15 percent
Elevation: 5800 to 6800 feet
Mean annual temperature: 45 to 51 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 12 to 16 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Nomrah series.  Nomrah soils have an argillic horizons. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, very low to very high runoff, moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are mainly used for rangeland, woodland, 
wildlife habitat and recreation. Potential native vegetation 
is Utah juniper, pinyon pine, Gambel's oak, Utah serviceberry, mountain big sagebrush, Indian rice grass and mutton grass.  This soil has been correlated to Upland Stony Loam (Pinyon-Utah juniper)(X035XX321UT) range site at the type location in Utah.
