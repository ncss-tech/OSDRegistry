UANA SERIES

Uana soils consist of moderately deep over a duripan, well drained soils that formed on eroded fan remnants. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Uana soils formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and reworked lacustrine sediments. The mean annual precipitation is about 275 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

Appledellia, Graven and Hutchinson soil are not moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October due to summer convection storms. Appledellia soils have a thin duripan, less than 5 cm thick. Hutchinson soils average 15 to 35 percent gravel in the particle-size control section. Studhorse soils have a calcic horizon above the duripan and contain rock fragments in the horizon above the duripan that range up to 40 percent. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Uana soils are on eroded fan remnants at elevations of 1,800 to 2,150 meters. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Uana soils formed in alluvium from welded tuff and mixed lacustrine sediments. The climate is cool continental, with a mean annual precipitation of 200 to 300 mm and a mean annual temperature between 7 to 11 degrees C. The frost free period is 100 to 130 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Acoma, Cedaran, Decan and Wakansapa soils. Acoma soils have an Ochric epipedon and a calcic horizon between below an argillic horizon at 75 and 100 cm. Cedaran and Wakansapa soils are shallow to bedrock. Decan soils have a Mollic epipedon that averages 18 to 30 cm. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; slow or medium runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Potential native vegetation is black sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, and Indian ricegrass. This pedon is correlated to ecological site Shallow Clay Loam 8-12 P.Z., R029XY104NV. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: East-central Nevada. Uana soils are of small extent. MLRA 28A and 29.
