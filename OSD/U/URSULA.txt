Depth to seasonally high water table: 0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches)
Soil Reaction: Moderately alkaline throughout
Sulfurous odor: Slight to strong throughout and odor intensity decreases with depth
Salinity: Ranges from 32 to 100 ppt but averages 60 to 70 ppt

COMPETING SERIES:
Naniak soils have coarser textured materials throughout that developed from volcanic lava and organic deposits in Micronesia

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: Semiarid coastal plain in southern Puerto Rico (MLRA 273).
Landform: Tidal mangrove swamps and flats in estuaries in and near coastal areas.
Parent Material: Fine fluviomarine deposits
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 22 to 31 degrees C. (71 to 88 degrees F.)
Mean Annual Precipitation: 508 to 1,600 millimeters (20 to 63 inches)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Boqueron soils do not contain sulfidic soil materials, receive less tidal flooding and occur on slightly higher landscape positions.
Manglillo and Mareas soils have thick organic soil horizons and both occupy landscape positions lower in elevation.
San Felipe soils have thick organic soil horizons and occur on similar landscape positions.
Serrano soils have coarser textured horizons and occur on slightly higher landscape positions. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class: Very poorly drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (KSAT): Moderately low to moderately high
Flooding frequency and duration: Very frequent for extremely brief duration from tides, these areas are subject to flooding by storm surge and hurricanes

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses: Water quality, water storage, and wildlife habitat.  Significant portions of these soils are in nature preserves with some areas used for harvesting crabs.
Dominant Vegetation: Consists of black mangrove trees and other halophytic plants 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coastal areas of Puerto Rico (MLRA 273). The series is of small extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: SPECIAL PROJECTS OFFICE
