UPSATA SERIES 

The Upsata series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium and glacial outwash.  These soils have a large component of volcanic ash in the surface layer.  Upsata soils are on terraces in cool, narrow valleys affected by cold air drainage.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed Andic Haplocryepts 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Upsata gravelly ashy fine sandy loam in coniferous forest. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    0i--0 to 2 inches; undecomposed and slightly decomposed forest litter. 

    E--2 to 4 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) ashy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine pores; 10 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 4 inches thick) 

    Bw--4 to 15 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly ashy fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine pores; 20 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.7); clear wavy boundary.  (7 to 13 inches thick) 

    2C1--15 to 42 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand, brown (7.5YR 5/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; 50 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.8); gradual smooth boundary.  (14 to 32 inches thick) 

   2C2--42 to 60 inches; pink (5YR 7/3) extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand, reddish gray (5YR 5/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine and fine pores; 50 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.9).

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Excessively drained; moderately rapid permeability to about 15 inches and very rapid below. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Upsata soils are used for production of forest products, wildlife habitat, and watersheds.  The native vegetation is coniferous forest consisting of subalpine fir, western larch, Engelmann spruce, lodgepole pine, and Douglas-fir with an understory of pinegrass, blue huckleberry, common beargrass, twinflower, and grouse whortleberry. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Upsata soils are of small extent in western Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Missoula County, Montana, 1985. 

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretation Record MT0408.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: an ochric epipedon from the mineral soil surface to 7 inches (E, Bw horizons); an albic horizon from the mineral soil surface to 4 inches (E horizon); an ash influenced layer from 2 to 15 inches (E, Bw horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bw, 2C1 horizons).  Upsata soils have a cryic temperature regime and a udic moisture regime. 

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data--S70 MONT-32-11. 

The 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Sandy-skeletal, mixed Andic Eutrocryepts to Sandy-skeletal, mixed Andic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.
