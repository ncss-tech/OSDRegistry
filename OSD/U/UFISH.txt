UFISH SERIES

The Ufish series consists of deep, well drained soils on backslopes of mountains.  Ufish soils are formed in volcanic ash overlying colluvial and residual material derived from granitic rocks. Slopes are 30 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ufish ashy sandy loam woodland, on a 35 percent south-facing slope at an elevation of 6,560 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

	Oi--0 to 1 inches; needles and twigs.

(4 to 7 inches thick)

	Bw--6 to 19 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) stony ashy silt loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic and weakly smeary; common fine and few medium and coarse roots; few fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel and 15 percent stones; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary.
