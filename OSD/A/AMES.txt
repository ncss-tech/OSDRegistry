AMES SERIES

The Ames series consists of very deep, poorly or very poorly drained soils that formed in glacial till, reworked glacial till, or till-derived sediments.  These soils occur on flat to slightly depressed areas of small size on dissected landscapes that border stream valleys.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 815 millimeters.
