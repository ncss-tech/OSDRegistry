AMNICON SERIES

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Anton series.
Anton--have a sand content of more than 40 percent in the lower third of the series control section

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--clayey till
Landform--knolls and side slopes on ground moraines
Slope--0 to 15 percent
Elevation--185 to 425 meters above sea level
Mean annual air temperature--4 to 6 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation--685 to 940 millimeters
Frost-free period--125 to 190 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Anton, Bergland, Borea, Cuttre, Miskoaki, and Superior soils.
Anton--are on landscape positions similar to those of the Amnicon soils and have a sand content of more than 40 percent in the lower third of the series control section
Bergland--are on lower landscape positions on nearly level areas and in depressions and are frequently saturated from the surface of the soil to a depth of 0.3 meter during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Borea--are on slightly lower landscape positions and have a frequently saturated zone between depths of 0.15 and 0.45 meter during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Cuttre--are on slightly lower landscape positions and have a frequently saturated zone between depths of 0.15 and 0.6 meter during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Miskoaki--are on higher landscape positions and do not have a frequently saturated zone within a depth of 1.8 meters during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Superior--are on landscape positions similar to those of the Amnicon soils and have a clay content that averages 10 to 18 percent in the upper half of the particle-size control section

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--moderately well drained--a frequently saturated zone occurs between depths of 0.3 and 1.0 meter during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of 30 year mean of annual precipitation, this saturation is considered perched
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--0.00 to 10.00 micrometers per second

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are forested.  Some areas are cultivated or pastured. The principal crops are oats, bromegrass, timothy, alfalfa, trefoil, and red clover.  Many areas which were formally cultivated are now idle and are reverting to natural vegetation. The native vegetation is mixed coniferous and deciduous forest.  Common trees are red maple, balsam fir, white spruce, white pine, quaking aspen, paper birch, and bur oak.  Common understory vegetation includes American hazel, redosier dogwood, black snakeroot, big leaf aster, wild sarsaparilla, and bracken fern. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Physiographic division--Laurentian Upland
Physiographic Province--Superior Upland
MLRA--Superior Lake Plain (92)
LRR K; northern Wisconsin, northeastern Minnesota, and Upper Peninsula of Michigan along Lake Superior
Extent--moderate

REMARKS:
Particle size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 75 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 170 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 25 centimeters (A, E and E/B horizons); 
albic horizon--the zone from a depth of 5 to 13 centimeters (E horizon); 
glossic horizon--the zone from a depth of 13 to 41 centimeters (E/B and B/E horizons); 
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 25 to 109 centimeters (B/E, Bt, Btk1, and Btk2 horizons);
udic moisture regime.
 
Vertic subgroup--linear extensibility of 6 centimeters or more in the upper 100 centimeters

Oxyaquic subgroup--saturation within 100 centimeters for 20 or more consecutive days or 30 or more cumulative days during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of 30 year mean of annual precipitation

The intense reddish colors inherent in the parent material often mask the redoximorphic features and make taxonomic classification difficult.  Water table studies in this soil (and its associated soils) were used to classify this series.

Cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data (NSSL).
