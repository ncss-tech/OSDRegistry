ARNEY SERIES

The Arney series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loess and in the underlying paleosol in till. The Arney soils are on dissected till plains.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. Series in a similar family are the Blocher, Deuchars, Gallipolis, Jeneva, Percell, Stonehead, Tarhollow, and Westgate series. Blocher, Gallipolis, and Stonehead soils are less than 203 cm (80 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Deuchars soils have more than 30 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Jeneva soils do not have subhorizons with brittleness within the series control section. Percell soils have less than 25 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Tarhollow soils have more than 30 percent clay in the lower part of the argillic horizon. Westgate soils have hue redder than 7.5YR in some subhorizon within the argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Arney soils are on narrow summits, shoulders and backslopes of dissected till plains of Illinoian age. Slope ranges from 2 to 6 percent. The soils formed in 127 to 178 cm (50 to 70 inches) of loess and in the underlying paleosol in till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1067 to 1143 mm (42 to 45 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 11.7 to 12.8 degrees C (53 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 170 to 200 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ava, Cincinnati, Hoosierville, Lieber, and Stinesville soils on till plains. The moderately well drained Ava soils are on summits. The well drained Cincinnati soils are on shoulders and backslopes. The poorly drained Hoosierville soils are on broad level summits. The somewhat poorly drained Lieber soils are on nearly level summits and on shoulders. The well drained Stinesville soils are on higher lying summits and shoulders.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. Depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 46 to 76 cm (1.5 to 2.5 feet) between December and April in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part of the solum and moderately low in the lower part. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and slow in the lower part. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used for growing corn and soybeans. A few areas are used for small grain (mainly wheat), hay, pasture, or woodland. Native vegetation is mixed deciduous hardwood forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 114B in south-western Indiana. The series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Owen County, Indiana, 1997.

REMARKS: These soils have been mapped and correlated as Muren soils in adjacent subset soil surveys, and were included in mapping with the Ava and Vigo soils in the 1964 Owen County Soil Survey.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 23 cm (Ap horizon).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 23 to 203 cm (Bt, Btx, 2Bt horizons).
