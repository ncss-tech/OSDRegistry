ARIZER SERIES

The Arizer series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils. These soils formed in loamy eolian deposits from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. Arizer soils are on nearly level to gently sloping plains and playa slopes. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 406 mm (16 in) and mean annual temperature is 15 degrees C. (59 degrees F).

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used for rangeland. Small areas are used for irrigated cropland. Principal crops where irrigated are grain sorghum and wheat. Climax vegetation is dominantly short grasses with a few mid grasses and includes blue grama, black grama, and buffalograss, with lesser amounts of vine-mesquite, western wheatgrass, sideoats grama, galleta, or tobosa, silver bluestem, wild alfalfa, and prairie clover. This soil has been correlated to the Loamy (R077DY042TX) ecological site in MLRA-77D.

REMARKS: This is a Benchmark Series. The Arizer series was formerly included in the Acuff series.
Classification changed from Calcic Paleargids to Ustic Calciargids based on lab data showing total clay decreasing by more than 20 percent from the maximum within 150 cm (59 in) of the mineral soil surface. The epipedon meets all requirements for a mollic horizon except that the epipedon is moist for less than 90 cumulative days in normal years.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon: 0 to 41 cm (0 to 16 in) A horizon Bt1 horizons. 
Argillic horizon: 15 to 203 cm (5 to 80 in) Bt, Btkk, and Btk horizons.
Calcic horizon: 57 to 203 cm (22 to 80 in) Btkk and Btk horizons.
