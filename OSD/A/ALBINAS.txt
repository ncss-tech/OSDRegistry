ALBINAS SERIES

The Albinas series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium from mixed sources on alluvial fans, and terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. The average annual precipitation is 30 to 48 centimeters (12 to 19 inches). The average annual air temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C. (45 to 50 degrees F.)

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Pachic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Albinas loam, rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  A1--0 to 8 centimeters (0 to 3 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; many very fine roots; many very fine pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 20 centimeters (3 to 8 inches) thick)

  Bt1--8 to 30 centimeters (3 to 12 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine pores; many prominent clay films on vertical faces of peds; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (20 to 30 centimeters (20 to 30 centimeters (8 to 12 inches) thick)

  Bt2--30 to 64 centimeters (12 to 25 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine pores; many prominent clay films on vertical faces of peds; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (23 to 36 centimeters (9 to 14 inches) thick)

  Bk--64 to 152 centimeters (25 to 60 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; strongly effervescent; calcium carbonate disseminated and as few soft masses; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

COMPETING SERIES: these are the Bluewater, Farnum, Funmar, Garrett, Haxtun, Jarita, Keya, Ownyate, Prosper, Renner, Sampson, Traclee, Vosburg and Wetterdon series.
Bluewater are somewhat poorly drained. 
Garrett soils have hue of 5YR or redder. 
Haxtun soils have buried soil horizons within depth of 102 centimeters (40 inches). 
Jarita soils have bedrock above depth of 102 centimeters (40 inches).
Farnum soils have a warm average annual soil temperature. 
Funmar, Keya, Renner, Tracylee and Wetterdon soils lack free carbonates above 30 inches. 
Ownyate are formed in alluvium derived from granite, gneiss and schist. 
Prosper soils have redoxomorphic features within 1 meter of the surface and are moderately well drained. 
Renner soils also have iron and manganese concretions within 1 meter (39 inches) of the soil surface. 
Sampson soils are influenced by arkosic sands. 
Vosburg soils are mostly dry in the moisture control section from May 15 to July 15. 
Wetterdon soils have more than 15% but less than 35% fine sand and coarser in the control section and C horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: stream valleys
Landform: alluvial fans, fan aprons, stream terraces, and drainageways 
Elevations: 1097 to 1981 meters (3,600 to 6,500 feet)
Slope: 0 to 6 percent 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: these are Ascalon, Keith, Moskee, Rago, Recluse, Satanta and Vetal series.
Satanta, Keith, Moskee, Recluse and Ascalon soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick 
Rago soils have fine textured control sections. 
Vetal soils are coarse-loamy and lack an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:   
Drainage: well 
Runoff: low  
Saturated hydraulic conductivity:    moderately high 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for rangeland, dry cropland, irrigated cropland, and wildlife habitat.
Soils under dry farming are cropped to wheat. 
Irrigated soils are cropped to corn, potatoes, field beans, sugar beets, alfalfa, and domestic grasses for hay and pasture.
Native vegetation is western wheatgrass, blue grama, buffalograss, needleandthread grass, and prairie junegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Wyoming and northeastern Colorado. The series is moderately extensive.
