SERIES ESTABLISHED: Forest County, Wisconsin, 1995. 

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 74 to 124 centimeters; series control section--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
ochric epipedon--the zone from a depth of 5 to 13 centimeters (E horizon); 
albic horizon--the zone from a depth of 5 to 13 centimeters (E horizon); 
spodic horizon--the zone from a depth of 13 to 38 centimeters (Bs1 and Bs2 horizons);
glossic horizon--the zone from a depth of 38 to 99 centimeters (E/B and B/Ex horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 74 to 137 centimeters (B/Ex and Btx horizons); 
fragipan--the zone from a depth of 74 to 137 centimeters (B/Ex and Btx horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Oxyaquic subgroup based on redoximorphic accumulations and saturation below the spodic horizon but within 1.0 meter for 20 or more consecutive days or 30 or more cumulative days during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of 30 year mean of annual precipitation.

Argonne soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both). Horizonation below the spodic horizon has a wide range depending on the extent to which eluviation has occurred and the depth to the fragipan. Therefore, there can be E/B, E/Bx, B/E, or B/Ex horizons singly or in combination, with or without Bt, Btx, BC, or BCx horizons.
