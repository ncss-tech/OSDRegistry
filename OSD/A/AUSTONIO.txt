AUSTONIO SERIES

The Austonio series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvial sediments. These soils are on nearly level to moderately steep Pleistocene age terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C (66 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1170 mm (46 in).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the closely related Bernaldo soils, and the Annona, Besner, Freestone, and Mollville series. Bernaldo soils are on similar landscapes.
Annona soils:   have a clayey subsoil and are on similar positions.
Besner soils:   have a coarse-loamy control section and are on slightly higher positions.
Freestone soils:   have glossic materials and are on similar or slightly lower positions.
Mollville soils:   have grayish subsoil and are on slightly lower, more concave positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Austonio soils are well drained and are moderately permeable. Runoff is very low on slopes of 1 to 3 percent, low on slopes of 3 to 5 percent, and medium on slopes greater than 5 percent.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for pastureland. Some areas are cropped to corn, small grain or truck crops. Pastures are mainly improved bermudagrass, bahiagrass or common bermudagrass. Pastures are commonly overseeded with arrowleaf clover, crimson clover, or vetch.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: East Texas. The series is moderately extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Houston County, Texas; 1991.

REMARKS: These soils were formerly included with the Stidham or Dougherty series. The series was assigned to an active activity class in March, 1999. The series was revised in 2002 to allow extremely acid reaction throughout the solum.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
Ochric epipedon------ 0 to 48 cm (0 to 19 in) (A1, A2, and E horizons).
Argillic horizon----- 48 to 173 cm (19 to 68 in) (Bt1, Bt2, BCt1 and BCt2 horizons).
