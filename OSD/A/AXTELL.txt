AXTELL SERIES

The Axtell series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in clayey alluvium of Pleistocene age derived from mudstone. These nearly level to strongly sloping soils are on treads and risers on stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 984 mm (38 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C (66 Degrees F).

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: McLennan County, Texas; 1947. The name "Axtell" comes from the Axtell community in McLennan County. 

REMARKS: The Axtell soils were formerly included in the Crockett series. More recently the Edge, Gredge, and Kurten series have been separated out of the Axtell series because they have thinner sola with less clay in the lower Bt horizons. This revision confines the Axtell series to stream terraces or terrace remnants in upland positions. This will reduce the total acres of the series. However, it will still be largely extensive. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in) 
Redox depletions with chroma 2 or less: 20 to 53 cm (8 to 21 in) 
Argillic horizon: 20 to 203 cm (8 to 203 in) 
Redox concentrations: 20 to 203 cm (8 to 80 in) 
Slickensides: 53 to 94 cm (21 to 37 in) 
Secondary carbonates: 94 to 203 cm (37 to 80 in) 
Gypsum accumulations: 94 to 203 cm (37 to 80 in) 
Abrupt textural change: At the upper boundary of the Bt horizon
