COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Nunanjiak, Atkaktut, and Niakuk soils.
Nunanjiak soils have andic soil properties at depths between 46 to 67 cm (10 to 20 in) and are underlain by paralithic bedrock.
Atkaktuk soils have a subgelic soil temperature regime and do not have a cambic horizon.
Niakuk soils are strongly smeary within the upper cambic horizon (12 to 24 cm, 5 to 9 in) and have an ochric epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class: well drained
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: very high in the Oi horizon and moderately high to high in the A, Bhs, 2Bw, and 2C horizons
Permeability: very rapid in the Oi horizon, moderate to rapid in the A, Bhs, and 2C horizons, and moderate to moderately rapid in the 2Bw horizon
Runoff: high

USE AND VEGETATION:
Use: wildlife habitat, recreation, and subsistence
Native vegetation: Sitka alder, bluejoint, fireweed, spreading woodfern, larkspurleaf monkshood, and arctic starflower.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 240, Nulato Hills-Southern Seward Peninsula Highlands. The series is of moderate extent.
