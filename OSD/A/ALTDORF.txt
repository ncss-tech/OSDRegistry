ALTDORF SERIES

The Altdorf series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in 35 to 75 centimeters of loess or other silty deposits and in the underlying till or residuum from micaceous schist, or both.  These soils are on uplands underlain by bedrock along drainageways and in depressions.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 765 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota; MLRA SSO 10-9 (Rhinelander, Wisconsin).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Wood County, Wisconsin, 1971.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 58 to 108 centimeters; series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 152 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 43 centimeters (Ap, Eg, and E/Bg horizons); 
albic horizon--the zone from a depth of 20 to 43 centimeters (E and E/Bg horizons); 
glossic horizon--the zone from a depth of 30 to 58 centimeters (E/Bg and B/Eg horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 58 to 152 centimeters (2Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3, 2Bt4 horizons);
aquic moisture regime.

Till is thought to be derived from the local residuum although the glacial stratigraphy in the area of these soils is not fully worked out.

Cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data (NSSL).
