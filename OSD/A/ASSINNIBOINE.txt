ASSINNIBOINE SERIES

The Assinniboine series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian, alluvium, or glaciofluvial deposits.  These soils are on sedimentary plains, till plains, hills, alluvial fans, fan remnants, and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Argiustolls

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Butte County, South Dakota, 1970.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations records:  MT0049, MT1071.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  
Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 10 inches (Ap and Bt1 horizons); 
Argillic horizon - the zone from 6 to 16 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons);
Accumulation of lime - the zone from 16 to 48 inches (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons).  

Assinniboine soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
