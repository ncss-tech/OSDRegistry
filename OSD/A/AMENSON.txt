AMENSON SERIES

The Amenson series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and alluvium derived from volcanic ash on moderately undulating uplands and mesas.  Slopes are 1 to 9 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Petrocalcic Paleustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Amenson loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

   A--0 to 3 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many medium and fine, few very fine roots; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 4 inches thick)

   Bt--3 to 11 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; strong medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common moderately thick clay films on faces of peds and in pores; slightly effervescent, slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 14 inches thick)

   Bk--11 to 15 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak coarse angular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and very coarse roots; 20 percent coarse fragments mainly pieces of the petrocalcic horizon; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).  (3 to 5 inches thick)

   Bkm--15 to 19 inches; petrocalcic very pale brown (10YR 8/3) moist; massive; extremely hard; laminar; 91 percent calcium carbonate; no roots; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Catron County, New Mexico, E. 1/2, NE 1/4 Sec. 11 T. 1 N., R. 17 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Depth to petrocalcic horizon: 6 to 20 inches

A horizon - Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR
Value:  3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma:  2 or 3 dry or moist
Texture:  loam or silty clay loam.

Bt horizon - Hue:  2.5Y or 10YR
Value:  3 through 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma:  2 or 3 dry or moist
Texture:  clay loam or sandy clay loam.

Bk horizon - Hue:  2.5Y or 10YR
Value:  3 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist
Chroma:  3 or 4 moist
Texture:  sandy loam, silt loam with 10 to 25 percent gravel.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Amenson soils are developed in volcanic ash and alluvium on moderately undulating uplands with slopes of 1 to 9 percent.  Elevation ranges from 6,800 to 7,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 to 15 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 47 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 115 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Albinas, Capulin, Datil, Flugle, Ralphston, and Ruidoso soils.  Albinas, Capulin, Datil, Flugle, Ralphston, and Ruidoso lack petrocalcic horizons and are deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderately slow runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for grazing.  The native vegetation consists of blue grama, western wheatgrass, juniper, and pinyon.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Catron County, central New Mexico, the soils are of small extent. MLRA 35.
