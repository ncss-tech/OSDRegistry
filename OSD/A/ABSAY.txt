ABSAY SERIES 

The Absay series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans and low hills. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Leptic Natrustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Absay silty clay loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    E--0 to 2 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; strong medium and fine angular blocky structure; hard, very firm, moderately sticky and very plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine pores; strongly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 7 inches thick)

    Btnz--2 to 11 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; strong coarse angular blocky structure; hard, very firm, moderately sticky and very plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; strongly effervescent; common fine threads and masses of salt; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2); gradual irregular boundary. (5 to 18 inches thick)

    Btkz--11 to 15 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) silty clay loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; few fine masses of lime; strongly effervescent; many fine threads and masses of salts; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick)

    Bkz--15 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine pores; disseminated lime; few fine masses of lime; violently effervescent; many medium masses and common fine threads of salt; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

COMPETING SERIES:
There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - stream terraces, alluvial fans and low hills.
Elevation - 3,800 to 6,000 feet.
Slope - 0 to 8 percent.
Parent material - alluvium.
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers.
Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 14 inches.
Mean annual air temperature - 38 to 44 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 70 to 115 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Dyce soil. Dyce soils are fine and do not have a natric horizon. This soil occurs on similar landforms.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, very slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Absay soils are mainly used for rangeland.  The potential native vegetation is mainly western wheatgrass, alkali sacaton, eriogonum, nuttall saltbush, rubber rabbitbrush, and greasewood. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Absay soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana. MLRA 44B.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Jefferson County, Montana, 1998. 

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 2 inches (E horizon)
Natric horizon - from 2 to 15 inches (Btnz, Btkz horizons)
Horizons of salt accumulation - from 2 to 60 inches (Btnz, Btkz, Bkz horizons)
Particle-size control section - from 2 to 15 inches (Btnz, Btkz horizons).  

Absay soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
