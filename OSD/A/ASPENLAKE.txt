ASPENLAKE SERIES

The Aspenlake series consists of moderately deep to duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from andesite and basalt.  Aspenlake soils are on glacial outwash terrace and have slopes of 1 to 12 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F (6 degrees C), and the mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches (760 mm).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, active Typic Duricryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Aspenlake stony loam, forested.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

 A1--0 to 4 inches (0 to 10 cm); dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) stony loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; moderate fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine and medium, and few coarse roots; many very fine irregular pores; 10 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 inches (8 to 20 cm) thick)

 A2--4 to 10 inches (10 to 25 cm); dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; moderate very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine and medium, and few coarse roots; many very fine irregular pores; 10 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6); abrupt wavy boundary.  (4 to 12 inches (10 to 30 cm) thick)

 Bw--10 to 26 inches (25 to 66 cm); dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) gravelly loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; moderate very fine and fine angular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine irregular pores; 15 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (13 to 20 inches (33 to 51 cm) thick)

 2Bqm--26 to 60 inches (66 to 152 cm); strongly cemented gravelly duripan.

TYPE LOCATION:  Klamath County, Oregon; north of Aspen Lake approximately 2,200 feet west and 1,600 feet south of the northeast corner of sec. 17, T. 37 S., R. 7 E., W.M.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days in the four months that follow the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 47 degrees F (6 to 8 degrees C).  The mean summer soil temperature is 55 to 59 degrees F (13 to 15 degrees C) and is 44 to 47 degrees F (7 to 8 degrees C) when an O horizon is present.  Depth to a strongly cemented duripan is 20 to 40 inches (50 to 100 cm).  The particle-size control section averages 12 to 18 percent clay, 15 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Depth to bedrock is over 60 inches (150 cm).  It is moderately acid to slightly acid.  The moist bulk density is 1.00 to 1.30 grams per cubic centimeter in the soil material above the duripan.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.

The Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Aspenlake soils are on glacial outwash terrace at elevations of 4,000 to 4,500 feet (1210 to 1365 m).  These soils formed in alluvium derived from andesite and basalt.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 35 inches (510 to 890 cm).  The mean annual air temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F (4 to 7 degrees C).  The frost-free period is less than 100 days.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Whiteface, Woodcock and Pokegema soils.  Whiteface soils are less than 20 inches to a duripan.  Woodcock soils are loamy-skeletal and over 60 inches deep.  The Pokegema soils are fine, halloysitic and are 40 to 60 inches deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderate permeability above the duripan and very slow within the duripan.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production and livestock grazing.  Native vegetation includes an overstory of ponderosa pine, white fir, Douglas fir, and incense cedar.  Understory includes oceanspray, Pacific serviceberry, common snowberry, squawcarpet, tall Oregon grape, douglas spirea, and Idaho fescue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Oregon.  The series is inextensive.
