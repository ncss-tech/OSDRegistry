ANVIK SERIES 

The Anvik series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Anvik soils are on alluvial fans and valley filling side slopes.  Slopes range from 5 to 50 percent.   Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean air temperature is about 40 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Alfic Argicryolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Anvik loam, in woodland with grass understory.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  

    Oi--0 to 1 inch; undecomposed needles and twigs. 

    A1--1 to 7 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; neutral; clear smooth boundary. 

    A2--7 to 11 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure that parts to moderate medium granular; slightly hard, very friable, neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the A horizons is 7 to 16 inches) 

    E--11 to 16 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium platy structure that parts to moderate medium granular; slightly hard, very friable; neutral; clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 7 inches thick) 

    B/E--16 to 21 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few faint clay films on faces of peds; about 20 percent of horizon is composed of diffuse tongues of material like that described in the E horizon; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick) 

    Bt1--21 to 41 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) cobbly clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; 15 percent cobbles and stones; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 25 inches thick) 

    Bt2--41 to 49 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) cobbly clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 25 percent cobbles and stones; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 15 to 40 inches) 

    C--49 to 61 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) cobbly clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 35 percent cobbles and stones; neutral.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bear Basin, Monad, Quietus, and Slipman series.  
Bear Basin:  are strongly acid.  
Slipman:  have more than 35 percent fine sand and coarser in the Bt2 horizon.  
Monad:  does not have an E horizon, has a glossic horizon above the argillic horizon
Quietus:  have a lithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: alluvium derived from mixed sources.
Landform: alluvial fans and valley filling sideslopes.
Slopes:  3 to 50 percent
