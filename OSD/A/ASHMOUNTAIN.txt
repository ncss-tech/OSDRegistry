ASHMOUNTAIN SERIES

The Ashmountain series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium over residuum derived from granitic rocks. The Ashmountain soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes range from 6 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 700 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Ultic Haploxeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Ashmountain fine sandy loam on a south-facing (176 degree), 24 percent slope under a canopy of blue oak and annual grasses at an elevation of 757 meters. (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted. When described on April 22, 2013 the soil was moist throughout.)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Ashmountain soils are on linear backslopes of hills and mountain slopes. Slopes are 6 to 30 percent. These soils formed in colluvium over residuum derived from granitic rocks. Elevations are 415 to 1050 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 670 to 735 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 15 to 17 degrees C. The frost free season is 240 to 285 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Andregg and Shepherdsaddle soils. The Andregg soils are on convex backslopes of hills and are 50 to 100 cm to a paralithic contact. Shepherdsaddle soils are fine-loamy and occur on similar landscape positions to Ashmountain.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderately high or high saturated hydraulic conductivity throughout the soil profile. 

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Vegetation is blue oak, interior live oak, buckeye, and annual grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Foothills of California; MLRA 18. The series is not extensive.
