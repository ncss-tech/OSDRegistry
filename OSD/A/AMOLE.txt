AMOLE SERIES

The Amole series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources.  Amole soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 1 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, thermic Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Amole sandy loam - rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 1 inch; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak thin platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few fine irregular pores; 10 percent gravel, noneffervescent slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary.

    C1--1 to 19 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.

    C2--19 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy coarse sand, brown (7.5YR 5/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.

TYPE LOCATION:  Mohave County, Arizona; latitude 34 degrees, 29 minutes, 20 seconds north, longitude 113 degrees, 44 minutes, 1 second west; 1,350 feet east and 150 feet north of southwest corner of sec. 4, T13N., R14W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture:  Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July-September and December-February.  Driest during May and June. Typic aridic moisture regime.

Rock Fragments:  0 to 35 percent.  Dominantly pebbles in the particle size control section

Soil Temperature:  61 to 72 degrees F.
Organic Matter:  Typically less than 1 percent but can range to 2 percent in the surface

A horizon
Hue:  7.5YR, 10YR
Value:  4 or 5 moist 
Chroma:  3 or 4, dry or moist

C horizons
Hue:  7.5YR, 10YR
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma:  3 or 4, dry or moist
Texture:  sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand or sand
Rock fragments:  10 to 25 percent gravel

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Challenger (CA), Hypoint (NV), Livefire (CA), Orwash (NV), Redington (AZ), Shortbread (AZ), and Yellowrock (CA) series. Challenger, Hypoint, Livefire, Orwash, Shortbread, and Yellowrock soils are in the Mohave Desert and are moist in the soil moisture control section for less than 20 days cumulative between July and September.  Redington soils have densic (Cd) horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Amole soils are on fan terraces at elevations of 1,500 to 2,700 feet.  These soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources.  Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 7 to 12 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 59 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 200 to 250 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bucklebar, Continental, Tres Hermanos, Anthony, and Arizo soils.  Bucklebar, Continental and Tres Hermanos soils have an argillic horizon.  Anthony soils are coarse-loamy and Arizo soils are sandy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very low runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Amole soils are used for grazing.  The present vegetation is Joshua Tree, snakeweed, cholla, bush muhly and threeawn.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Arizona. This soil occurs in MLRA 40.  This series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Mohave County, Arizona, Southern Part, 2005.

REMARKS:  This series was originally proposed in Pima County, Arizona, Eastern Part, 1975.  The use of this series in Pima County has been discontinued.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 1 inches (A horizon)

Entisol feature - the absence of diagnostic horizons
