SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Distribution: Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia
Extent: Large 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Columbia County, Georgia; 1911.

REMARKS: 
The June 1988 revision recognized low activity clay properties of this soil as defined in the Low Activity Clay Amendment to Soil Taxonomy, August, 1986 and changed the classification from Typic Hapludults to Typic Kanhapludults. The December 2005 revision changed the type location from a mesic region (Rockingham County, North Carolina) to a thermic region.  The November 2025 revision changed the format.  No data was changed.
REVISED: 6/5/97-RLV; 12/30/2000-DTA; 11/2025-DTA

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 30 centimeters (0 to 12 inches).  (Ap, E, and BE horizons)
Argillic and kandic horizon--the zone between 30 to 122 centimeters (12 to 48 inches) has low activity clay in more than 50 percent of the horizon (Bt horizon)
