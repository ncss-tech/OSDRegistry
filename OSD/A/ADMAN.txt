ADMAN SERIES

The Adman series consists of shallow, well drained, soils that formed in alluvium on moderately sloping old basalt flows.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Lithic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Adman stony loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

   A--0 to 2 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) stony loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak thin platy and weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; 13 percent pebbles; 10 percent cobbles; and 10 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 3 inches thick)

   Bt1--2 to 5 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) gravelly clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common fine and very fine roots; 20 percent pebbles, 10 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; few thin patchy clay films on faces of peds; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)

   Bt2--5 to 9 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) cobbly clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine and common fine roots; clay films on faces of peds; 15 percent pebbles, 10 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)

   Bt3--9 to 15 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) cobbly clay, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine angular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine and very fine roots; clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent pebbles, 10 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt irregular boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

   2R--15 inches; basalt.

TYPE LOCATION:  Northern Catron County, New Mexico; NW 1/4, NW 1/4, sec. 34, T. 4 N., R. 13 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture:  Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section December through April and July through October.  The soil is driest during the months of May and June. Aridic ustic moisture regime.

Soil Temperature:  44 to 47 degrees F.

A horizon:  Hue - 7.5YR or 10YR
Value:  3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma:  1 through 3
Rock fragments:  15 to 35 percent

Bt horizon:  Hue - 7.5YR or 10YR
Value:  3 through 7 dry, 2 through 6 moist
Chroma:  1 through 6
Texture:  Clay loam, or clay with 35 to 55 percent clay on a weighted average.
Rock fragments:  15 to 35 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on gentle to moderate sloping basalt flows and ridges at elevations between 7,400 and 8,700 feet.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 to 18 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 to 46 degrees F.  The average frost-free season is 80 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Barela, Raton and Smilo soils.  The Barela soils are deep, and the Smilo soils are moderately deep.  Raton soils are skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  The soils are well drained have moderately rapid runoff and have moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Principal use of this soil is for grazing land.  The present vegetation is blue grama, muhly species, muttongrass, bottlebrush squirreltail as well as trailing daisy, apacheplume, and rabbitbrush.  Some soils support scattered oneseed juniper and pinyon.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Adman soils occur on basalt flows in Catron County in western New Mexico.  They are moderately extensive. MLRA is 35 and 39.
