SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Stafford County, Virginia, 1971.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
a. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 11 inches (Ap and E horizons). 
b. Cambic horizon - the zone from 11 to 20 inches (Bw horizon).
Soil horizon depths were modified on 10/2021 to ensure the description began at the soil surface.
