ARANSAS SERIES

The Aransas series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey alluvial sediments of Holocene age.  These nearly level soils are on flood plains on the south Texas coastal plain.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 in).

Austwell soils: have an ochric epipedon
Edroy soils: have noneffervescent sola and mixed clay mineralogy
Gepford soils: formed in sediments derived from granite and are in the thermic temperature regime
Surfside soils: have a very-fine particle-size control section 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: clayey alluvial sediments of Holocene age.
Landscape: nearly level coastal plains
Landform: flood plains of streams subject to flooding by saltwater during high storm tides
Slope: 0 to 1 percent
Mean annual air temperature: 20.6 to 22.8 degrees C (69 to 73 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 635 to 1143 mm (25 to 45 in)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Odem, Sinton, Austwell, Placedo and Swan series.
Odem and Sinton soils: occur on similar landforms and are loamy throughout
Austwell soils: are on similar landforms and have an ochric epipedon
Placedo and Swan soils: are on similar landforms and do not have slickensides

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained. Permeability is very slow.  Runoff is high.  The soil is frequently to occasionally flooded by over-bank flow, and also occasionally to rarely flooded with salt water resulting from tidal surge during tropical storm events.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation includes cordgrass, sedges, water hyacinth, and spiny aster.  Some areas produce buffalograss, species of paspalum, curly mesquite grass, little bluestem, and switchgrass.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South Texas along major rivers; Land Resource Region: T; MLRA: Gulf Coast Saline Prairies (MLRA 150B).  Series is of large extent.

REMARKS:  Classification changed from Vertic Haplaquolls to Typic Natraquerts 11/2000 based on typifying pedon description. 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in pedon are:

Mollic epipedon: 0 to 89 cm (0 to 35 in). (A and Bkss horizons)
Redoximorphic concentrations: 61 to 178 cm (24 to 70 in). (Bkss horizons)
Slickensides: 61 to 178 cm (24 to 70 in). (Bkss horizons) 
Aquic conditions:  0 to 135 cm (0 to 53 in). (A and Bkss horizons)

ADDITIONAL DATA: KSSL data on lab pedon number 09N1065. This pedon is in the same delineation as the type location. The particle-size distribution for this pedon is within range for the series but not typical.
