ACME SERIES

The Acme series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils.  These soils formed in loamy alluvium or lacustrine sediments of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on stream terraces of the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78B, 78C).  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 16.7 degrees C (62 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 610 mm (24 in).

TYPICAL PEDON:  Acme silt loam--on a 0.2 percent slope in cropland.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same family.  Similar soils are the Vinson series.
Vinson soils: do not have a gypsic horizon and are underlain by massive gypsum bedrock of alabaster or crystalline gypsum mainly of the Blaine Formation of Permian age

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loamy alluvium or lacustrine sediments of Pleistocene age with large amounts of secondary gypsum.
Landform: Treads of stream terraces.
Slope: 0 to 3 percent.
Mean annual precipitation: 508 to 686 mm (20 to 27 in).
Thornthwaite annual P-E indices: 32 to 40.
Mean annual air temperature: 15.0 to 17.8 degrees C (59 to 64 degrees F).
Frost-free period: 200 to 230 days.
Elevation: 426.7 to 670.6 m (1,400 to 2,200 ft).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Abilene, Aspermont, Childress, Roark, and Tipton series.  These soils do not have a gypsic horizon.
Abilene, Roark, and Tipton soils: Have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick, have an argillic horizon, do not have a gypsic horizon, and occur on similar to slightly higher positions.
Aspermont soils: Have an ochric epipedon, do not have a gypsic horizon, have Permian redbed sediments within 60 inches of the surface, and occur on higher sideslopes.
Childress soils: Have an ochric epipedon and occur on similar positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is moderate.  Runoff is negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes and low on 1 to 3 percent slopes.  Some areas have an intermittent water table between 122 and 183 cm (4 and 6 ft) of the surface during some above normal rainfall years.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are cultivated to wheat and cotton.  Native vegetation is mid and tall grasses.  Some areas are mined for the underlying gypsiferous materials that is used for making wall board.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Rolling Red Plains of western Oklahoma and Texas; LRR H; MLRA 78B and 78C.  Small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Hardeman County, Texas; 1933

REMARKS:  The Acme series was previously described as having a solum 10 to 20 inches thick and underlain by gypsiferous caliche, gypsite or alabaster gypsum.  Study of these soils in 1999, across the series province, has shown solum depth to range mainly from 20 to 40 inches to gypsiferous materials and a gypsic horizon.  The Cottonwood series, which has been mapped mainly in upland positions, but also in a complex with Acme soils in some areas, will be typified with a paralithc contact of massive gypsum bedrock and will be limited to upland positions associated with Permain age materials.  A new series will be developed to typify the soils that have been mapped in a complex with Acme soils.  Mollisols that have been mapped in the Acme series underlain with massive gypsum bedrock, mainly alabaster, will be included with the Vinson series.
