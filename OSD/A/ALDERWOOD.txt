06/2018--Changed from previous 2011 classification of loamy-skeletal, isotic, mesic, Vitrandic Dystroxerepts. Existing laboratory data for this series and other geographically associated soils does not reflect the presence of adequate quantities of volcanic glass to support the Vitrandic subgroup. This OSD was edited according to SSR01 Technical Note--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 11/2017).

ADDITIONAL DATA: Partial data available for this series. Sample # S71WA033002, 71WA033003, S04WA061002, and S09WA053098
