ARENZVILLE SERIES

The Arenzville series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils which are moderately deep or deep to a buried soil formed in mostly light-colored, relatively recent (post-settlement), mostly silty alluvium overlying buried soils with dark colored A horizons.  These soils are on flood plains and upland drainageways.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 775 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, nonacid, mesic Typic Udifluvents 

TYPICAL PEDON: Arenzville silt loam, on a slope of less than 1 percent, in a pasture, at an elevation of about 262 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

 A--0 to 25 centimeters; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam with thin strata of yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) and very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak medium granular structure; friable; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (12 to 39 centimeters thick) 

 C--25 to 64 centimeters; stratified brown (10YR 5/3), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), and very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam; massive breaking to medium plates along depositional strata; friable; few thin lenses of very fine sand; slightly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. (25 to 64 centimeters thick) 

 Ab--64 to 102 centimeters; black (10YR 2/1) silt loam; weak medium platy structure parting to weak medium granular; friable; few fine prominent brown (7.5YR 4/4) masses of iron accumulation; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary. (12 to 62 centimeters thick) 

 C'--102 to 152 centimeters; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam stratified with a few thin lenses of fine and very fine sand; massive breaking to thick plates along depositional strata; friable; common medium prominent brown (7.5YR 4/4) and dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) masses of iron accumulation and common medium distinct grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) iron depletions; neutral.
