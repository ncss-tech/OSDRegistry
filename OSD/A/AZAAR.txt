AZAAR SERIES

The Azaar series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium over calcareous siltstone and sandstone residuum. These soils occur on fan remnants, escarpments, hillslopes and mountain slopes. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 5.0 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustolls  

TYPICAL PEDON: Azaar fine sandy loam, cultivated (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 18 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine and very fine crumb structure and weak medium and fine blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots and very fine pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. 

    Bw--18 to 33 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak coarse and medium prismatic structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores, few medium pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 25 cm thick) 

    2Bk1--33 to 56 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak coarse and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; few medium pores; few fine faint lime masses; few fine angular sandstone fragments with lime crusts on underside; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); diffuse wavy boundary. 

    2Bk2--56 to 81 cm; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; massive; very hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; common medium distinct lime masses; few fine angular lime coated sandstone fragments; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); abrupt wavy boundary. (combined thickness of 2Bk1, 2Bk2 - 28 to 56 cm) 

    2R--81 cm; fractured indurated sandstone.
