ARVESON SERIES

The Arveson series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed mostly in loamy glaciolacustrine or outwash sediments on glacial lake and outwash plains. These soils have moderate or moderately rapid permeability in the upper part and rapid in the lower part. They have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 575 mm. Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Calciaquolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Arveson clay loam with a slightly concave nearly level slope adjacent to a beach ridge on a glacial lake plain in a meadow field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

 A--0 to 20 cm; black (10YR 2/1) clay loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak fine granular structure; very friable, slightly sticky; strong effervescence; slightly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. 

 Bkg1--20 to 36 cm; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay loam, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; weak very fine granular structure; very friable, slightly sticky; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. 

 Bkg2--36 to 64 cm; light gray (5Y 7/1) loam; weak very fine granular structure; very friable, slightly sticky; common convolutions of very dark gray (10YR 3/1); violent effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

 Bkg3--64 to 86 cm; gray (5Y 6/1) sandy loam; weak very fine granular structure; very friable, slightly sticky; many fine and medium masses of gray (5Y 5/1); violent effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (Combined Bkg horizons 15 to 81 thick) 

 2Cg1--86 to 117 cm; gray (5Y 6/1) loamy sand; few fine distinct pale olive (5Y 6/3) redoximorphic concentrations; weak very fine granular structure; very friable, slightly sticky; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 16 inches thick) 

 2Cg2--117 to 200 cm; light olive gray (5Y 6/2) fine sand; few fine prominent olive yellow (2.5Y 6/8) and few fine distinct pale olive (5Y 6/4) redoximorphic concentrations; single grain; loose; slight effervescence; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Hedman, Percy and Rockwell series. Hedman, Percy, and Rockwell: formed all or partially in till and have greater than 1 percent rock fragments in series control section
Percy: have a calcium carbonate equivalent of more than 25 percent below the Bk horizon

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform - plane or concave slopes on glacial lake plains and outwash plain
Slope - 0 to 2 percent
Elevation - 230 to 450 meters
Mean annual air temperature - 3 to 7 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation - 500 to 650 millimeters
Frost-free period - 110 to 160 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Flaming, Hecla, Ulen and Wyndmere soils 
Flaming and Hecla - are sandy, moderately well drained, and are on higher positions on the landscape
Ulen - are sandy, somewhat poorly drained, and are on slightly higher positions on the landscape
Wyndmere - are somewhat poorly drained and are on slightly higher positions on the landscape

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class - poorly and very poorly drained - a seasonal high water table is at the surface to 90 cm below the surface at some time during the period of March through July in the poorly drained phase.  It is 30 cm above the surface to 60 cm below the surface at some time during the period of February through August n the very poorly drained phase.
Runoff - slow and very slow
Saturated hydraulic conductivity - 5 to 50 micrometers per second (moderately high to high in the upper part and 50 to 150 micrometers per second (high) in the lower part

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of these soils are cropped to small grains and in a few places corn and soybeans. Some are used for growing pasture. Native vegetation is a wetsite community of the tall grass prairie. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Physiographic Division-Interior Plains
Physiographic Province-Central Lowland
Physiographic section-Western Lake section
MLRA - Red River Valley of the North (56) in North Dakota, Minnesota, and South Dakota; smaller areas in glaciolacustrine areas in MLRA's 55B and 102A
