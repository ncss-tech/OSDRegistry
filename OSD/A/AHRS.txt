AHRS SERIES

The Ahrs series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountain slopes. They formed in volcanic ash and loess over material weathered from metasedimentary rocks such as siltite and argillite. Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 915 mm and average annual air temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.

The Honeyjones soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the ash mantle and are on cooler, north-facing slopes. The Tigley soils are on adjacent foothills and have argillic horizons. The Latour soils are cryic and are located at higher elevations. The Lotuspoint soils are mesic and are on south-facing ridges. The Pinecreek soils are on south-facing mountain slopes and have umbric epipedons.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed. Potential natural vegetation is mainly grand fir, Douglas-fir, western white pine, and western larch, with an understory of Columbia brome, common snowberry, creambush oceanspray, goldthread, myrtle pachystima, longtube twinflower, starry false-Solomon's seal, queencup beadlily, piper anemone, sedge, and American trailplant.
