ANWAY SERIES

The Anway series consist of deep well drained soils that form in old mixed alluvium derived from granite, rhyolite, andesite, limestone and some basalt.  These soils are on valley plains.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 66 degrees.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Anway loam, desert range (colors for dry conditions unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 3 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; very few fine vesicular and few very fine and fine tubular and interstitial pores; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); abrupt smooth boundary (1 to 3 inches thick).

    Bt--3 to 18 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; plentiful very fine, fine and few medium roots; few very fine and fine tubular and few very fine interstitial pores; common distinct clay films on ped faces and in pores; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary (9 to 18 inches thick).

    C1--18 to 27 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; few very fine tubular pores; few fine mica flakes; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary (5 to 10 inches thick).

    Ck2--27 to 41 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) stratified fine sandy loam and sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; few fine and medium krotovina; few fine gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary (10 to 20 inches thick).

    Ck3--41 to 53 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) stratified silt loam, loam and very fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary (10 to 14 inches thick).

    C4--53 to 65 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) stratified silty clay loam, loam and clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few very fine and fine tubular pores; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Pima County, Arizona. 1,500 feet north and 60 feet east of S1/4 corner of Sec. 36, T13S, R10E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Unless irrigated, these soils are usually dry in most years in all parts between 4 and 8 inches.  Typic aridic moisture regime.

Mean annual soil temperature ranges from - 60 to 72 degrees F.

Organic matter content - less than one percent.

A horizon 
Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR
Value:  5 dry, 3.5 moist or greater
Chroma:  2 to 4, dry or moist

Bt horizon 
Hue: 7.5YR, 5YR
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma:  4 to 6, dry or moist
Texture: loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam
Clay content: Average more than 18 percent but less than 35 percent clay

C and Ck horizons 
Effervescence:  slight to strong.
Texture: range from silt loam to sandy loam with thin strata of loam, fine sandy loam and loamy fine sand included.
Other features:  These soils may have buried 2Bt horizons at approximately 30 to 40 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  These include Avenal (CA), Bryman (CA), Bucklebar (NM), Dutchflat (AZ), Garlock (CA), Hi Vista (CA), Milham (CA), Neuralia (CA), and Palomas (NM), series.  Avenal soils have hue redder than 10YR.  Bucklebar soil's base of the argillic horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches, with some extending to 50 inches.  Bryman, Dutchflat, Garlock, Hi Vista, and Neuralia soils are in the Mohave Desert.  Avenal and Milham soils are in the San Joaquin Valley.  These soils are moist in the soil moisture control section for less than 20 days cumulative between July and September.  Bryman, Garlock, Neuralia, and Palomas soils have argillic horizons that are more than 20 inches thick.  Dutchflat soils contain more than 15 percent gravel in the PSCS.  Hi Vista soils are moderately deep over granite bedrock.  Milham soils are effervescent throughout the entire profile.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Anway soils are on nearly level valley plains. Dominant slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. The regolith is formed in old alluvium from mixed sources including granite, rhyolite, andesite, limestone and possibly basalt. These soils are at elevations of 2,000 to 2,400 feet in a warm, arid and semiarid continental climate. The mean annual temperature is about 68 degrees F. The average annual rainfall ranges from 8 to 11 inches. The frost-free season ranges from 250 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  In addition to the Mohave and Sonoita soils, these include the Anthony, Trix, Valencia and Estrella series.  Anthony soils are moderately coarse-textured. Trix soils are moderately fine-textured and have a buried Bt horizon at moderate depths. Valencia and Estrella soils lack an argillic horizon within 20 inches of the surface.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well-drained. Permeability of the soil is moderate to moderately slow. Surface runoff is medium to slow.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for cultivated crops such as cotton and small grain. Some areas are used for seasonal grazing. The native vegetation consists of mesquite, creosotebush and annual weeds and grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern Pima County, Arizona and possibly Pinal County, Arizona. Anway soils are moderately extensive (approximately 16,200 acres mapped). MLRA 40.
