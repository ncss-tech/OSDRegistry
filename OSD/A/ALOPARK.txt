ALOPARK SERIES

The Alopark series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapid permeable soils that formed in calcareous, loamy colluvium derived from the Laverne (Valentine) Member of the Ogallala Formation of Miocene-Pliocene age. These very gently sloping to moderately steep soils occur on hillslopes, alluvial fans, and colluvial aprons. Slope are from 1 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 533 mm (21 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).
