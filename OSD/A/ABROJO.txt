ABROJO SERIES

The Abrojo series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from rhyolitic tuff. Abrojo soils are on south-facing backslopes of mesas, undulating plateaus, and canyons. Slopes are 25 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-skeletal, glassy, nonacid, mesic Vitritorrandic Ustorthents 

TYPICAL PEDON: Abrojo extremely cobbly ashy loamy coarse sand, extremely bouldery--on a backslope of a mesa sloping 50 percent to the south at 6,490 feet elevation--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. When described on November 10, 1999, the soil was dry throughout.) 
Surface is covered with 35 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones, and 15 percent boulders.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Abrojo soils are on south-facing backslopes of mesas, undulating plateaus, and canyons. They formed in colluvium over residuum derived from rhyolitic tuff of the Quaternary age Bandelier Tuff formation. Slopes are 25 to 65 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,700 to 7,200 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chiminet and Piojillo soils. Chiminet soils are ashy, very shallow, and occur on south-facing upper backslopes of mesas. Piojillo soils are ashy, are very deep, and occur on footslopes of valley sides. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; low surface runoff; rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Abrojo soils are used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed.  The historic climax vegetation is blue grama, black grama, galleta, skunkbush sumac, and oneseed juniper.  The ecological site is Hills (R036XB124NM). 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Abrojo soils are of small extent on the southwestern Espanola Basin part of the Basin and Range province in northcentral New Mexico. The MLRA is 36.
