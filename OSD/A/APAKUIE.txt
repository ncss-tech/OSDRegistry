APAKUIE SERIES

The Apakuie series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from volcanic ash, pumice and sand.  Apakuie soils are on uplands and have slopes of 12 to 20 percent.  Mean annual rainfall is about 30 inches and mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Medial over ashy, amorphic, isomesic Dystric Haplustands

TYPICAL PEDON:  Apakuie very fine sandy loam - pasture. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.  Textures shown are "apparent field textures").

     A1--0 to 2 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 2/2) loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; weak fine granular structure; friable; many roots; many fine pores; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 3 inches thick)

     A2--2 to 8 inches; dusky red (2.5YR 3/2) very fine sandy loam, dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2) dry; massive; friable; many roots; few stones; many very fine pores; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (4 to 7 inches thick)

     A3--8 to 15 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) very fine sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; massive; friable; common roots; many very fine pores; 5 percent gravel larger than 3/4-inch diameter; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 10 inches thick)

     C1--15 to 30 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) very fine sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) dry; massive; friable; few roots; many very fine pores; 5 percent gravel larger than 3/4-inch diameter; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick)

     C2--30 to 50 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) loamy sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) dry; weak coarse prismatic structure; friable; few roots; many very fine pores; 10 percent gravel larger than 3/4-inch diameter; neutral (pH 6.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  Hawaii County, Hawaii; about 1.5 miles north of Puu Kihe on Kukaiau Ranch; Umikoa Quadrangle; lat. 19 degrees 54 minutes 45 seconds N. and 155 degrees 23 minutes 30 W. (Old Hawaiian Datum). 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is more than 40 inches.  The A horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR.  The A1 horizon has weak to moderate structure.  The C horizon is very fine sandy loam to loamy sand.

COMPETING SERIES: (This needs updating.) These are the Huikau, Kamakoa, Keekee and Kilohana series.  Huikau soils have an ochric epipedon and have an ashy over cindery control section.  Kamakoa soils have a mollic epipedon, are calcareous in the lower part of the control section, and have mean annual soil temperature of 63 degrees F.  Keekee soils have a mollic epipedon and are calcareous in the control section.  Kilohana soils have a mollic epipedon and textures coarser than very fine sandy loam in the upper part of the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Apakuie soils are on mountain slopes at elevations ranging from 5,000 to 8,000 feet.  The slopes are 12 to 20 percent.  The soils formed in volcanic ash, pumice and sand underlain by unweathered cinders and `a`a lava.  Outcrops of `a`a lava are common.  The mean annual rainfall is 20 to 35 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 52 degrees F., average January temperature 47 degrees F., and average July temperature is 55 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Huikau and Kilohana soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for pasture and wildlife habitat.  The natural vegetation is mamani (Sophora chrysophylla), sweet vernal grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum), heu peueo (Trisetum glomeratum), and plantain (Plantago lanceolata).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  This series is on Mauna Kea.  The series is moderately extensive with a total of about 35,000 acres.

1. Apakuie----------- MEDIAL OVER ASHY, AMORPHIC, ISOMESIC DYSTRIC HAPLUSTANDS 
The soils found in the area of map units (MU) AFD and ASD were mapped incorrectly and classified as medial over ashy, non-skeletal (less than 35% coarse fragments in the CS) soils on high mountain slopes. After extensive revision of the Mauna Kea landscape, these soils will be updated and reclassified to a new soil series called POHAKULEHU-------ASHY-SKELETAL OVER FRAGMENTAL OR CINDERY, AMORPHIC OVER MIXED, ISOMESIC HUMIC USTIVITRANDS. The Pohakulehu soils will be set up to identify that they are Ashy-skeletal over fragmental or cindery and have greater than 35% coarse fragments in the CS.
- Map units:	
	AFD	Apakuie very fine sandy loam, 12 to 20 percent slopes
	ASD	Apakuie very stony very fine sandy loam, 12 to 20 percent slopes
- Both MU correlated to:
	 847     Pohakulehu very cobbly medial very fine sandy loam, droughty, 12 to 20 percent slopes
