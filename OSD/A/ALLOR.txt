ALLOR SERIES

The Allor series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Allor soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Durinodic Xeric Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Allor gravelly loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).  The soil surface is partially covered by approximately 30 percent gravel.

    A1--0 to 15 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine vesicular pores; 15 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to 18 cm thick)

    A2--15 to 30 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 15 cm thick)

    Bt--30 to 48 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 15 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 18 cm thick)

    Btq--48 to 86 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; few distinct and common faint clay films on faces of peds; 25 percent gravel; 15 percent weakly cemented durinodes; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (20 to 38 cm thick)

    Bq--86 to 107 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; very hard, firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; discontinuous weak silica cementation; few fine roots; few fine tubular pores; 25 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (15 to 40 cm thick)

    Bqk--107 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; very hard, firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; discontinuous weak silica cementation; 55 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Aladshi, Alley, Chime, Cleghorn, Glyphs, Igert, Mimentor, Nevador, Qwynn, Wedertz, Wedlar, and Zevadez series.

Aladshi and Wederdz soils have slightly acid or neutral A horizons. Alley soils have carbonates within 40 to 56 cm. Chime soils have a paralithic contact at 50 to 75 cm.  Cleghorn soils have 0 to 5 percent gravel in the particle-size control section. Glyphs and Zevadez soils have continuous weakly cemented horizons at depth of 30 to 50 cm. Igert soils are moderately deep to hard bedrock. Mimentor soils have A horizons that are neutral. Qwynn soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Nevador soils have segregated carbonates with a depth of 100 cm and have Cq horizons that have durinodes in a friable matrix.  Wedlar soils have additional soil moisture from thunderstorms during the summer months.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Allor soils occur on fan remnants. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Elevations are 1,590 to 2,075 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The climate is semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 8 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Wieland and Zaidy soils.   Wieland soils have more than 35 percent clay in their argillic horizons.  Zaidy soils have a strongly cemented duripan.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Allor soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, Sandberg's bluegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 28B.
