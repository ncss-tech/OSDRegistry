AUTEN SERIES

The Auten series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy and sandy outwash on outwash plains, terraces, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, active, mesic Aquollic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Auten loam, on a less than 1 percent slope in a cultivated field at an elevation of 223 meters (731 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

[13 to 76 cm (5 to 30 inches) thick]

 BC2--102 to 190 cm (40 to 75 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) loamy sand; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; very friable; few fine faint grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions in the matrix; 5 percent shale fragments and 2 percent gravel; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary.

 BC3--190 to 203 cm (75 to 80 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) coarse sand; single grain; loose; few fine distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions in the matrix; 2 percent shale fragments and 2 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Binghampton series. Binghampton soils have less than 75 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Auten soils are on outwash plains, terraces, and moraines that have a planar or convex surface. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Auten soils formed in loamy and sandy outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 1016 mm (29 to 40 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 11.1 degrees C (48 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 170 days. Elevation is 197 to 259 meters (650 to 850 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alida, Brady, Coupee, Quinn, Rensselaer, and Tracy soils. Alida and Brady soils are on similar positions but do not have contrasting textures. Coupee and Tracy are well drained soils on slightly higher elevations and formed in similar materials as Auten soils. Quinn soils are poorly drained and are on lower elevations. Tracy soils have less clay in the B horizon and have a lighter colored surface layer.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 61 cm (0.5 to 2.0 feet) between November and May in normal years.
Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the loamy materials and high or very high in the underlying sandy materials. Permeability is moderate in the loamy materials and rapid in the underlying sandy materials. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are mostly cropped. Principal crops are corn, soybeans, small grain, and hay. Native vegetation is mixed forest and grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 98 and 111C in northern Indiana. The series is of small extent.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon: from the surface to 9 inches (Ap horizon); fits the definition of a mollic epipedon since the thickness is 1/3 or more the total thickness between the mineral surface and the base of the argillic horizon. However, it is not a Mollisol because the Bg and BC horizons above a depth of 125 cm have less than 50 percent base saturation. 
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 23 to 56 cm (9 to 22 inches) (Bt horizon).
Aquic conditions: redoximorphic features present in all horizons below 23 cm (9 inches).

NASIS Data Mapunit ID 401618 represents the typical pedon.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Lab characterization data for the typical pedon (S01IN-141-003) is being analyzed at the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE. Transect data (T01IN-141-141) is on file at the MLRA project office in Plymouth, IN. Transect shows 100 percent Auten soils.
