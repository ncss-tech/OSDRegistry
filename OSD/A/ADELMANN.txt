ADELMANN SERIES

The Adelmann series consists of very deep, well drained soils with moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity that formed in alluvium and colluvium from lacustrine deposits mixed with volcanic and sedimentary rocks. Slopes range from 4 to 50 percent in foothills. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

Some pedons have patchy secondary calcium carbonates below 36 inches

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cassiro, Cochran, Eglirim, Fivesprings, Nammoth, Pickup and Ruclick series. Cassiro soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact and have less than 10 percent cobbles and stones throughout. Cochran soils have average annual soil temperatures of 47 to 50 degrees F. and are 30 to 50 inches to the base of the argillic horizon. Eglirim soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to the base of the argillic horizon. Fivesprinqs, Nammoth, Pickup and Ruclick soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Adelmann soils are on southerly facing hill backslopes and footslopes, fan remnants, butte escarpments and structural benches. Slopes range from 4 to 50 percent. These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium (commonly landslide deposits) from lacustrine deposits mixed with volcanic and sedimentary rocks. The elevation ranges from 2,875 to 4,100 feet. The average annual precipitation is 13 to 16 inches and the average annual temperature is 48 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free period is 120 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aldape, Barbermill and Cranegulch soils. Aldape and Cranegulch soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments throughout. Barbermill soils are shallow to paralithic contact and have less than 35 percent rock fragments throughout.  These soils occur on similar geomorphic positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Adelmann soils are used mainly for rangeland. Natural vegetation is basin big sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Ada County, Idaho. MLRA 11. Adelmann soils are of small extent.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
Mollic epipedon - zone from the surface to 10 inches (A and AB horizons)
Argillic horizon - zone from 10 to 60 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4 and Bt5 horizons)
Particle-size control section - zone from 10 to 30 inches
Soil moisture regime - aridic bordering on xeric
These soils are drier than other Xerolls in the region under similar precipitation due to early runoff and extended period of high evapotranspiration.
