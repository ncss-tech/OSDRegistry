ALDERMAND SERIES

The Aldermand series consists of very deep, well-drained soils that
formed in mixed volcanic ash and material from granitic or metamorphic rock.  Aldermand soils are on mountains and canyons and have slopes of 35 to 85 percent.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part and rapid in the lower part.  The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  
Mannering soils: have low chroma redoximorphic features at a depth of 50 to 100 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Aldermand soils are on canyon and mountain sideslopes at elevations of 1,200 to 4,940 feet (366 to 1506 meters).  The slope range is 35 to 85 percent.  These soils formed in mixed volcanic ash and material weathered from granitic residuum.  The average annual temperature ranges from 41 to 46 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 27 to 65 inches (686 to 1650 mm) and the frost-free season is 50 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Crumarine, Kauder (T),
Texascreek and Uvi series.  Crumarine soils are in drainageways and are somewhat poorly drained.  Kauder soils are on hills, have a volcanic ash mantle and have a fragipan.  Texascreek soils are on south and west-facing convex slopes and have a mesic soil temperature regime.  Uvi soils are on similar landscapes and are fine-loamy in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is medium to rapid. Permeability is moderate in the upper part and rapid in the lower part.

USE AND VEGETATION:  This soil is used primarily for timber production,
livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed.  The
natural vegetation is mainly western redcedar, grand fir, western
larch, Douglas-fir, Myrtle pachystima, goldthread, common princes pine,
queencup beadlily and sweetscented bedstraw.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Idaho.  Aldermand soils are moderately extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES PROPOSED:  Clearwater County, Idaho, 1979.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 2 to 7 inches (A horizon).
Vitrandic feature - the zone from 2 to 17 inches (A, Bw1, Bw2 horizons).
Cambic horizon - the zone from 7 to 25 inches (Bw and 2Bw horizons).
Particle-size control section - the zone from 12 to 42 inches (Bw1, Bw2, 2Bw3, 2BC and part of the 2C1 hrozions).

The ranges in values listed under the A and Bw horizons for volcanic glass content and acid-oxalate extractable Al + 1/2 Fe are estimates only.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data is available for two pedons of Aldermand.  Soil survey sample numbers - S92ID-035-026 (this pedon) and S92ID-035-027; Pedon numbers - 92P 964 and 92P 965. (Soil survey sample no. S92ID-035-027 was originally sampled as Oviatt series).
