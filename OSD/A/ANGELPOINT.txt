ANGELPOINT SERIES

The Angelpoint series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in granitic and metamorphic residuum and colluvium. The Angelpoint soils are on mountains. Slope ranges from 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 76 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 23 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, hyperthermic Lithic Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON: On Dalvord-Angelpoint-Rock outcrop association, 30 to 75 percent slopes at an elevation of 610 meters. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The surface is covered by approximately 45 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles, and 15 percent stones and boulders.

 A--0 to 5 centimeters (0 to 2 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely cobbly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate thick platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots throughout; slightly effervescent; 40 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles, and 15 percent stones; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); abrupt wavy boundary. (2 to 10 centimeters thick)

 Bw--5 to 25 centimeters (2 to 10 inches); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive parting to weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots throughout; violently effervescent; 45 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); abrupt smooth boundary. (15 to 34 centimeters thick)

 R--25 centimeters (10 inches); unweathered, fractured granitic bedrock with pockets of weathered bedrock material of moderate to high excavation difficulty.

TYPE LOCATION: San Bernardino County, California; about 600 feet west and 300 feet south of the northeast corner of sec. 30, T. 14 N., R. 5 E.; 35 degrees, 17 minutes, and 02.5 seconds north latitude, and 116 degrees, 30 minutes, and 58.5 seconds west longitude; West of Red Pass Lake USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle, UTM 11S, 0546930e 3904470n (DTM: NAD83). 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Soil moisture control section: Usually dry, moist in some part for short periods during winter and early spring and for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October following convection storms. The soils have a Typic-Aridic moisture regime.

Soil temperature: 22 to 27 degrees C (72 to 81 degrees F).

Surface rock fragments: 65 to 95 percent; with 15 to 70 percent gravel, 5 to 40 percent cobbles, 1 to 35 percent stones, and 0 to 25 boulders.

Depth to bedrock: 18 to 36 centimeters.


Organic matter: 0 to 0.5 percent.

Control section -
Rock fragments: 35 to 80 percent gravel, cobbles, stones.

Clay content: 6 to 15 percent.

A horizon
Value: 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma: 3 or 4 dry, 2 through 6 moist.
Texture of the fine earth: loamy sand, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, coarse sandy 	loam, or loam.
Clay content: 6 to 15 percent.

Rock fragments: total 40 to 80 percent; with 25 to 65 percent gravel, 5 to 30 	percent cobbles, and 0 to 20 percent stones.
Clay content: 6 to 15 percent.
Effervescence: noneffervescent through violently effervescent.
Reaction: neutral or slightly alkaline.

Bw or Bk horizon
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y.
Value: 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 through 6, dry or moist.
Texture of the fine earth: sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, or loam.
Clay content: 8 to 18 percent.

Rock fragments: total 35 to 80 percent; with 25 to 65 percent gravel, 0 to 25 	percent cobbles, and 0 to 2 percent stones.
Effervescence: noneffervescent to violently effervescent.
Reaction: neutral through moderately alkaline.
Other features: some pedons have 1 to 3 percent, thin, calcium carbonate coats 	on the bottom of some rock fragments.


R horizon
Bedrock: Unweathered, slightly to highly fractured granitic bedrock, with 	pockets of slightly to moderately weathered bedrock material of moderate 	to extremely high excavation difficulty.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Blackeagle (T CA) and the Lomitas (AZ) series. Blackeagle soils have a lithic contact deeper than 36 centimeters. Lomitas soils have a moisture control section that is moist in some part for more than 20 days, cumulative, between June and September. In addition, Lomitas soils allow hues of 5YR and 7.5YR throughout.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Angelpoint soils are on mountains. Slope ranges from 30 to 75 percent. The soils formed in granitic or metamorphic residuum and colluvium. Elevations are 485 to 1,070 meters (1,600 to 3,500 feet). The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 50 to 127 millimeters (2 to 5 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 21 to 26 degrees C (70 to 79 degrees F). The frost-free season is 320 to 365 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dalvord soils. Dalvord soils are on similar landscape positions but on different aspects and/or higher elevations. Dalvord soils do not have a cambic horizon. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; very high runoff; moderately rapid permeability above the bedrock.

USE AND VEGETATION: Angelpoint soils are used for military exercises, recreation, and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly white brittlebush with minor amounts of creosotebush, white bursage, hedgehog barrel cactus, desert needlegrass and range ratany.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southeastern California. MLRA 30. These soils are of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: PHOENIX, ARIZONA

SERIES ESTABLISHED: San Bernardino County, California, Fort Irwin Soil Survey Area, 1999. The name is from a location in the Avawatz Mountains.
