GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Billington, FortNeck, Massapog, Nagunt, Napatree, Pishagqua, Rhodesfolly, and Wequetequock soils.
Billington, Pishagqua, and Wequetequock soils--are in mainland coves and lagoon bottom landscapes and have fluid silt loam materials in the soil profile.
Fort Neck soils--have finer textures and fluid silt loam materials at the soil surface.
Massapog soils--are found on flood tidal delta flats in coastal lagoons and do not have sulfidic materials within 100 centimeters of the soil surface.
Nagunt soils--form on washover fan flats and washover fan slopes of coastal lagoons.
Napatree soils--are on adjacent landscapes dominated by till material in mainland coves and mainland submerged beaches, and have finer textures in their substratum layers.
Rhodesfolly soils--are found on washover fan flats in open bays.
