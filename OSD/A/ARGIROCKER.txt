ARGIROCKER SERIES

The Argirocker series consists of shallow to very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from limestone.  Argirocker soils are on backslopes on ridges and dipslopes of mountains.  Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 533 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Argiustolls

(Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on September 1, 2005 the soil was dry throughout.

 Oi--0 to 1.5 centimeters; slightly decomposed pine needles, cones, twigs, and herbaceous plant residue.  (1 to 2.5 centimeters thick)

 Bt2--15 to 25 centimeters; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) extremely flaggy silty clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) dry; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few (20 percent) faint clay films on all faces of peds; 60 percent angular and subangular limestone fragments, of which 20 percent are flagstones, 20 percent cobbles, 15 percent channers, and 5 percent stones; common medium and very fine, few fine roots, matted around and between rock fragments; few very fine discontinuous pores; soil matrix is noneffervescent, a thin layer surrounding most rock fragments is strongly to violently effervescent; slightly alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 10 to 20 centimeters)

 R--25 to 203 centimeters; very strongly cemented or indurated, fractured limestone; distance between fractures is 35 to greater than 50 centimeters.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Citadel - are very deep, fine textured, and lack mollic epipedons; on concave positions generally below Argirocker soils
Rockerville - do not have argillic horizons; on similar landscape positions
Sawdust - are deep or very deep; generally on backslopes below Argirocker soils
Vanocker - are deep or very deep; generally on shoulders and backslopes below Argirocker soils

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to rapid runoff, depending on slope; moderate to moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Argirocker soils are typically sparsely to moderately wooded and utilized for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and limited timber production.  The native vegetation consists of an overstory of ponderosa pine and bur oak; understory species include porcupine grass, slender wheatgrass, various bluegrasses, Oregon grape, and common juniper. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Argirocker soils occur on the low limestone plateau physiographic area of the Black Hills of South Dakota and possibly Wyoming; LRR G, MLRA 62; the series is of small extent.

SERIES PROPOSED: Lawrence County, South Dakota, 2006.  The name is a derivative of the geographically-associated Rockerville series.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 1.5 to 25 centimeters.
Particle-size control section (argillic horizon):  The zone from 7 to 25 centimeters.  (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 1.5 to 25 centimeters.  (A, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons)
Lithic contact:  The contact with hard limestone at 25 centimeters.  (R horizon)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
