ARENISCO SERIES

The Arenisco series consists of very deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in sandy eolian sediments of Holocene age.  These soils are on nearly level to gently undulating, vegetated lag dunes on the south Texas coastal plain.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Cayo, Lopeno, Noria, Potrero, Saucel, Sauz, and Topo series.
Cayo and Topo soils: are calcareous throughout and are on lower landforms.
Lopeno, Noria, and Potrero soils: have buried soils and are on lower landforms.
Saucel and Sauz soils: are in a coarse-loamy particle-size family and are on lower landforms.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Excessively drained.  Rapid permeability.  Runoff is negligible.  Soils are very rarely flooded for very brief periods during severe tropical storms by tidal surges in the months of May through November.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation consists mostly of short to mid grasses such as sand bur, hairy grama, seacoast bluestem, gulfdune paspalum and threeawn.  Forbs such as partridge pea, croton, ragweed, beebalm, false indigo, also many yellow and white flowered asteraceae of an unknown species at this time.  The ecolocical site is Coastal Sand, PE 31-44 (150BY648TX).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Gulf Coast Saline Prairies (MLRA 150B in LRR T) of south Texas.  The series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Kenedy County, Texas; 2007.

REMARKS:  This soil was formerly included in the Falfurrias series.  The Arenisco series was separated based on the occurrence of a water table at 102 to 203 cm (40 to 80 inches).
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon  0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in). (A horizon)
Particle size control section - The zone from 25 to 102 cm (10 to 40 in)
Redoximorphic concentrations  163 to 203 cm (64 to 80 in). (C3 horizon)
