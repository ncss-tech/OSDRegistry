ACOMA SERIES

The Acoma series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and mixed lacustrine deposits. Acoma soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Mizpah soils. Mizpah soils formed in mixed alluvium over a siltstone paralithic contact at 50 to 100 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Acoma soils are on eroded fan remnants. These soils formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and mixed lacustrine deposits. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Elevations are 1,600 to 2,050 meters. The climate is cool continental.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Decan and Uana series. Decan and Uana soils have a mollic epipedon over a duripan.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; slow or medium runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Acoma soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The potential native vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, cliffrose, buckwheat, Astagalus, blue grama, Indian ricegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, and some Utah juniper and singleleaf pinyon pine. This pedon is correlated to ecological site R029XY006NV, Loamy 8-10 P.Z.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: East-central Nevada. These soils are of small extent. MLRA 29.

REMARKS: Before 2009 the original classification of Acoma series was Xeric Paleargids.  

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the surface to 10 cm (A horizon).
Abrupt boundary - An increase of 20 percent clay in a vertical distance of 2.5 cm of the upper boundary of the argillic horizon.
Argillic horizon - The zone from 10 to 76 cm (Bt1, Bt2 and Bt3 horizons).
Calcic horizon - The zone from 76 to 100 cm (Bk1 horizon).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 60 cm (Bt1, Bt2 and part of the Bt3 horizons).
