ALGOA SERIES

The Algoa series consists of deep, moderately well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in thick, loamy sediments.  These nearly level soils are pimple mounds on coastal prairies of Pleistocene age.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1397 mm (55 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (69 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES:  
There are no competing series in the same family.  Series in similar families include Addicks, Clodine, Jeanerette, Mocarey, and Morey series.  
Addicks soils: have less than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section  
Clodine, Jeanerette, and Morey soils: occur on different geomorphic positions

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: loamy fluviomarine deposits derived from igneous, metatmorphic and sedimentary rock
Landscape: coastal plains
Landform: pimple mounds
Slope: 0 to 3 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 1219 to 1473 mm (48 to 58 in)  
Thornwaite annual P-E indices: 62 to 80
Mean annual air temperature range: 20 to 22.2 degrees C (68 to 72 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 330 to 340 days
Elevation: 3 to 31 m (10 to 100 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  
These are the competing Mocarey and Morey soils and the Aris, Bernard, Crowley, Leton soils.  Mocarey soils: adjacent to Algoa soils on flat landforms
Aris, Crowley, and Morey soils occur on similar landscapes in areas that lack free carbonates  
Bernard soils: occur on slightly lower positions
Leton soils: occur in depressional areas

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  
Drainage class: Moderately well drained
Permeability class: moderately slow
Runoff: low
The soil has a perched water table at about 2 feet during the winter and that is about 5 feet during the dry part of the summer.  Some areas are subject to brief flooding during high intensity rains because runoff is not removed rapidly enough.

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Used mainly for pasture and range.  A few areas are used for field crops and truck crops.  The native vegetation is largely a mixture of Andropogon and Paspalum species with some sedges.
Ecological sites assigned to phases and components of this series are listed below. Current ecological site assignments are in Web Soil Survey. Components of this series include the following ecological sites: Northern Loamy Prairie

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  
General area:  Gulf Coast Prairies of Southeast Texas
Land Resource Region: T (Atlantic and Gulf Coast Lowland Forest and Crop Region)
Major Land Resource Area: 150A (Gulf Coast Prairies)
Extent: not extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Galveston County, Texas, 1981.

REMARKS:  The soil was formerly included in the Addicks, Clodine, and Morey series.  

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

     Mollic epipedon - 0 to 31 cm (0 to 12 in) (A horizon)
     Argillic horizon - 31 to 147 cm (12 to 58 in) (Btk horizons)
     Calcic horizon - 31 to 147 cm (12 to 58 in) (Btk horizons)

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Classification was changed to include an argillic horizon based on field descriptions and laboratory data.
NSSL Sample No. S81TX-167-3 suggests some evidence of moved clay in the lower solum.  This is interpreted as a buried argillic horizon and the series is classified by the easily identified calcic horizon.
