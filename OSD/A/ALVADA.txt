ALVADA SERIES

The Alvada series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in loamy, sandy, and gravelly outwash or glaciolacustrine deposits 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) thick overlying till. They are on outwash plains, lake plains, and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Series in related families are the Barry, Brookston, Millgrove, Navunon, Radioville, Rensselaer, Tallmadge, and Westland series. All of these series have a CEC to clay ratio of 0.6 or more, and have a superactive cation-exchange activity class. In addition, Barry, Millgrove, Rensselaer, and Westland soils have less than 22 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Brookston and Radioville soils have, in the middle part of the series control section, less than 60 percent of the sand fraction dominated by medium or coarser sand. Navunon soils are less than 102 cm (40 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Tallmadge soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Alvada soils are on outwash plains, lake plains, and till plains of late Wisconsin age. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Alvada soils formed in loamy, sandy, and gravelly outwash or glaciolacustrine deposits 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) thick overlying till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 1067 mm (32 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 13 degrees C (49 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 180 days. Elevation is 213 to 305 meters (700 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the well drained Shawtown, moderately well drained Thackery, and somewhat poorly drained Lamberjack soils on outwash plains; and the somewhat poorly drained Aurand and moderately well drained Cygnet soils on lake plains.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below between November and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the solum and moderately high or moderately low in the substratum. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum, moderately rapid in the lower part of the solum, and moderately slow or slow in the substratum. 

USE AND VEGETATION: A large proportion is under cultivation, primarily corn, soybeans, wheat, and hay. A relatively small proportion is in woodland. Native vegetation is deciduous forest, primarily ash, beech, elm, and maple.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 111B in west-central Ohio, and possibly eastern Indiana, and to a smaller extent in MLRA 99 in northwestern Ohio. The type location is in MLRA 111B. The series is of small extent.
