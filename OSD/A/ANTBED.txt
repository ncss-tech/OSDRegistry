ANTBED SERIES

The Antbed series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in alluvium. Antbed soils are on alluvial flats. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F. (18 degrees C) and the mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches (330 mm). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, thermic Ustic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Antbed loam - cropland. (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.)

    Btk2--41 to 63 inches, (104 to 160 cm); light brown (7.5YR 6/4) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; 39 percent clay; moderate medium subangular blocky parting to moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine and fine pores; 20 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 2 percent medium distinct carbonate masses; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

COMPETING SERIES: This is the White House (AZ) series. Whitehouse soils are on fan terraces, have greater than 30 percent sand and gravelly textures in the Bk horizons.   

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Antbed soils are on alluvial flats in bolsons at elevations of 4,000 to 5,500 feet (1,219 to 1,676 m). Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches (305 to 406 mm).  The mean annual air temperature is 62 to 67 degrees F. (17 to 19 degrees C). The frost-free period is 210 to 250 days.  

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dalby (TX), McAllister (AZ), Michigan (T) (TX), and Verhalen (TX) series. Dalby and Verhalen soils have slickensides and are located on basin floors. McAllister soils have a calcic horizon and are located on alluvial fans. Michigan soils lack an argillic horizon and are located on alluvial flats. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Runoff is low on slopes less than 1 percent and medium on slopes greater than 1 percent. Permeability is moderate over moderately slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for cropland and livestock grazing.   Vegetation consists of tobosa, blue grama, burrograss, sideoats grama, tarbush, and western honey mesquite.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Trans-Pecos Texas, LRR D, MLRA 42, Southern Desertic Basins, Plains, and Mountains. The series is of minor extent.
