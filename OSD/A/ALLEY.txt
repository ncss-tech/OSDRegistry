ALLEY SERIES

The Alley series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess over alluvium and colluvium derived from andesite, basalt and tuff with some influence from loess.  Alley soils are on side slopes and shoulders of low mountains, foothills, plateaus, and fan piedmont remnants. Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Durinodic Xeric Haplargids

TYPE LOCATION:  Eureka County, Nevada; 2 1/2 miles southwest of the Dunphy Ranch; approximately 1,850 feet north and 550 feet east of the apparent southwest corner of Sec. 35, T. 33 N., R. 48 E.; USGS Dunphy 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 41 minutes 17 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 32 minutes 12 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.6875000 latitude, -116.5366667 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in the winter and spring months, dry spring and fall; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.

Depth to weakly silica and carbonate cemented strata: 40 to 76 cm.
Depth to carbonates: 40 to 56 cm.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Aladshi, Allor, Chime, Cleghorn, Glyphs, Igert, Nevador, Qwynn, Wedertz, Wedlar and Zevadez series.  

Aladshi soils have 1 to 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the argillic horizon. Allor soils lack carbonates within a depth of 100 cm.  Cleghorn soils contain less than 15 percent coarse fragments. Chime and Igert soils are less than 100 cm deep to bedrock.  Glyphs soils have thick continuous weakly cemented layers extending below 100 cm.  Nevador soils have argillic horizons that contain less than 15 percent rock fragments and have Bqk horizons with durinodes in a friable matrix. Qwynn and Wedertz soils have an E horizon above the argillic horizon and have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the argillic horizon. Wedlar soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the argillic horizon and are moistened for 10 to 20 days in July and August by convection storms.  Zevadez soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments and have carbonates at 60 to 90 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Alley soils are on mountain and foothill shoulders and side slopes, plateaus, and fan piedmont remnant summits adjacent to hills and mountains.  These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from andesite, rhyolite, basalt and tuffs with some influence from loess. Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 1,190 to 2,256 meters.  The climate is cool semiarid with warm dry summers, and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is about 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brock, Tenabo, and Whirlo soils.  Brock and Tenabo soils have shallow indurated duripans.  Whirlo soils have cambic horizons and a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation consists mainly of Wyoming big sagebrush, spiny hopsage, Sandberg bluegrass, winterfat and downy rabbitbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern and North central Nevada.  MLRA 25, 28B.  These soils are of limited extent.
