ADELAIDE SERIES

The Adelaide series consists of shallow to duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks, with a mantle of loess high in volcanic ash. Adelaide soils are on fan piedmont remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Belcher, Blackhawk, Timper and Truhoy series. 

Belcher and Timper soils are calcareous above the duripan.  Blackhawk soils also lack an indurated duripan that is below a buried argillic horizon.  Truhoy soils contain 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and is moist 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Adelaide soils are on smooth to convex fan piedmont remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a loess mantle high in volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Elevations are 1,220 to 1,650 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 180 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Golconda and Weso soils and the competing Blackhawk soils.  Golconda soils have natric horizons.  Weso soils have weakly cemented Cqk horizons and lack a buried argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, Sandberg bluegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, cheatgrass, pepperweed and other annuals.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 24.
