AGA SERIES

The Aga series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in mixed alluvium on flood plains and low terraces.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Typic Torrifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Aga loam--cultivated.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

   Ap--0 to 10 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many fine and very fine roots; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 15 inches thick)

   C1--10 to 23 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (12 to 20 inches thick)

   2C2--23 to 43 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and very fine roots; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 30 inches thick)

   2C3--43 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) sand, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 10 percent pebbles; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Sandoval County, New Mexico; near Pena Blanca; New Mexico State Plane Coordinates N. 1,659,900 feet and E. 471,850 feet.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture - The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts more than 75 percent of the time when the soil temperature is greater than 41 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section is dry during May and June and is intermittently moist from July 1 through September. Typic aridic moisture regime.

Soil Temperature - 55 to 57 degrees F.

Depth to Contrasting Layers - 20 to 35 inches.

Reaction - Neutral to moderately alkaline.

Salinity - Less than 2 mmhos to 16 mmhos.


A Horizon:
Texture:  Loam or silty clay loam.

C Horizon:
Texture: Loam or very fine sandy loam.

2C Horizon
Hue:  10YR or 7.5YR
Value:  5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma:  3 or 4
Texture:  Sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand or gravelly sand.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Aga soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources and are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 5,000 to 6,000 feet.  The mean annual temperature is 53 to 55 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches.  The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Gilco, and Razito soils.  Gilco and Razito soils do not have contrasting particle-sizes within depths of 40 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderate permeability in upper part and rapid in lower part.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Nonirrigated areas of Aga are used for grazing.  Irrigated areas are used for crops and pasture.  The natural vegetation is fourwing saltbush, Indian ricegrass, and alkali sacaton.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northcentral New Mexico.  Series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Sandoval County, New Mexico, 1987.

REMARKS:

Diagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon are:

Entisol Feature:  The lack of diagnostic horizons.  (C, 2C1, and 2C2 horizons)

Fluventic feature:  The irregular decrease in organic matter and stratification.

Contrasting particle-size:  The occurrence of sandy textures at about 22 inches.  (2C1 horizon)
