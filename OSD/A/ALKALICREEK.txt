ALKALICREEK SERIES

The Alkalicreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rock.  These soils are on alluvial flats. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Aridic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Alkalicreek clay loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 6 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak thin platy structure; friable, slightly hard, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; many fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 12 cm thick)

    Bt1--6 to 18 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; very firm, hard, very sticky, very plastic; many fine roots; many fine tubular pores; 55 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary.

    Bt2--18 to 35 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate coarse angular blocky structure; very firm, hard, very sticky, very plastic; common fine roots; many fine tubular pores; 55 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 15 to 44 cm)

    By--35 to 75 cm; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) clay loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; weak medium angular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few fine roots; many fine tubular pores; 10 percent threadlike gypsum masses; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (20 to 50 cm thick)

    BCy--75 to 150 cm; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) sandy clay loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; massive; friable, slightly hard, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; very few fine roots; many fine tubular pores; 20 percent threadlike gypsum masses; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).
