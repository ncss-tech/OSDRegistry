ABBOTT SERIES

The Abbott series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sources.  Abbott soils are on flood plains, lake plains, and deltas.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TYPE LOCATION:  Millard County, Utah; about 0.5 mile east of old Topaz chicken ranch; approximately 160 feet west and 75 feet south of the northeast corner of section 23, T. 16 S., R. 8 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Mean annual soil temperature - 47 to 54 degrees F.

Cg horizons
Hue: 2.5Y or 5Y.
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma: 1 through 3, dry or moist.
Texture: Silty clay loam or silt loam; some pedons have horizons of sandy clay loam, sandy loam, loamy very fine sand, or sand.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Abbott soils are on flood plains, lake plains, and deltas.  These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sources.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches, the mean annual air temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 120 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Cache soil.  Cache soils have salic horizons and do not have cambic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; negligible to medium surface runoff; slow permeability (moderately low or moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity).  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between the soil surface and 1.5 feet (very shallow and shallow free water occurrence classes) between March and October.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  Drained phases are recognized.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Abbott soils are in native grass used both for hay and pasture. The vegetation is wiregrass and sedges with inland saltgrass and black greasewood on saline areas.  Where drained, these soils are used for growing alfalfa and small grain.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Utah.  These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 28A.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Phoenix, Arizona.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Delta Area, Utah, 1919.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 8 inches (A horizon).

Cambic horizon - The zone from 8 to 40 inches (Bg, BCg1, and BCg2 horizons).

Aquic conditions - The conditions of endosaturation, reduction, and redoximorphic features between the soil surface and 20 inches at certain times during normal years (parts of the A and Bg horizons).

Vertic subgroup feature - The zone from the soil surface to 40 inches with linear extensibility of 6.0 cm or more; additional support for the concept is based on the cracks noted in the series concept.

Particle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (BCg1 and BCg2 horizons and part of the Bg horizon).


The revision of December 2006 updated the taxonomic class from Vertic Fluvaquents based on the recognition of a cambic horizon in the horizons having alteration due to aquic conditions and no evidence of fine stratification.
