ABOR SERIES

The Abor series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from semiconsolidated shale, residuum from semiconsolidated shale, or semiconsolidated shale interbedded with siltstone or thin layers of sandstone, or in alluvium that is 20 to 40 inches deep over the shale.  These soils are on sedimentary plains, hills, alluvial fans, and lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation records:  MT0076, MT0721, MT1039

 Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 7 inches (Ap and Bss horizons); Vertisol criteria - slickensides from a depth of 6 inches to the paralithic contact (Bss, Bssk Bky horizons), cracks from the surface to the paralithic contact (Ap, Bss, Bssk, Bky horizons); particle-size control section - the zone from a depth of 10 to 40 inches, or to the paralithic contact (Bss, Bssk amd Bky horizons).  Abor soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.
