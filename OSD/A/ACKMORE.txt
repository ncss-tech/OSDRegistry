ACKMORE SERIES

The Ackmore series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains or alluvial fans.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 813 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, nonacid, mesic Mollic Fluvaquents

TYPICAL PEDON: Ackmore silt loam, on a nearly level flood plain, in a pasture, at an elevation of about 258 meters above sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 15 centimeters; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; friable; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (13 to 25 centimeters thick)

 C--15 to 64 centimeters; stratified very dark gray (10YR 3/1) and dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam; massive with weak thin alluvial stratification; friable; few fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. (25 to 76 centimeters thick)

 Ab1--64 to 76 centimeters; black (10YR 2/1) silty clay loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; friable; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary.

 Ab2--76 to 112 centimeters; black (10YR 2/1) silty clay loam; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate very fine and fine subangular blocky; friable; few fine dark iron-manganese masses; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.

 Ab3--112 to 152 centimeters; black (10YR 2/1) silty clay loam; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky; firm; few fine dark iron-manganese masses; neutral. (Combined thickness of the Ab horizon is 64 to 127 centimeters.)

TYPE LOCATION: Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) 108D-Illinois and Iowa Deep Loess and Drift, Western Part, Warren County, Iowa subset; about 2 miles southeast of Bevington; located about 2,230 feet west and 275 feet south of the northeast corner of section 5, T. 75 N., R. 25 W.; USGS Saint Charles topographic quadrangle; lat. 41 degrees 20 minutes 12 seconds N. and long. 93 degrees 45 minutes 34 seconds W., NAD 83.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Kezan and Quiver series.
Kezan--have a saturated zone within a depth of 0.3 meters during in the wettest periods of normal years
Quiver--do not have a dark colored buried soil within the upper half of the series control section

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--alluvium
Landform--floodplains or alluvial fans
Slope--0 to 5 percent
Elevation--185 to 575 meters above sea level
Mean annual air temperature--6 to 12 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation--585 to 1,040 millimeters
Frost-free period--150 to 220 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bremer, Colo, Wabash, and Zook soils.
Bremer--are at higher landscape positions on stream terraces and have an argillic horizon
Colo--are at lower landscape positions on floodplains, have an average clay content of 27 to 35 percent in the particle-size control section, and are frequently saturated at the soil surface during the wettest periods of normal years
Wabash--are at lower landscape positions on floodplains, have an average clay content of 45 to 60 percent in the particle-size control section, and are frequently saturated at the soil surface during the wettest periods of normal years
Zook--are at lower landscape positions on floodplains, have an average clay content of 35 to 45 percent in the particle-size control section, and are frequently saturated at the soil surface during the wettest periods of normal years

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--somewhat poorly drained-a saturated zone occurs between depths of 0.3 to 1.0 meter during March to June when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation and is considered apparent
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--1.00 to 10.00 micrometers per second
Surface runoff potential--negligible to low
Flooding--rarely or occasionally flooded for very brief to long duration from precipitation events and snowmelt

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are cultivated. The principal crops are corn and soybeans, some oats, and meadow. Some areas are pastured and wooded. The native vegetation is big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, and other grasses of the tall grass prairie.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Warren County, Iowa, 1975.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters (C, Ab1, and Ab2 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (Ap, C, Ab1, Ab2 and Ab3 horizons).

Diagnostic features and horizons in this pedon include:
buried layers with 5 to 7 percent organic matter--the zone from a depth of 64 to 152 centimeters (Ab1, Ab2, and Ab3 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
