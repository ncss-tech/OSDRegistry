ALRED SERIES 

The Alred series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in cherty hillslope sediments and the underlying clayey residuum. These soils are on moderately sloping to very steep uplands. Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent. Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal over clayey, siliceous, semiactive, mesic Typic Paleudalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON: Alred extremely cobbly loam - on a west facing, convex 26 percent slope in a fescue pasture at an elevation of 1,030 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   2Bt5--44 to 53 inches; dark red (2.5YR 3/6), yellowish red (5YR 4/6) and brown (7.5YR 5/2) gravelly clay; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate very fine angular blocky; firm; common very fine tubular pores; many prominent clay films of faces of peds; 20 percent chert gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual smooth boundary. 

   2Bt6--53 to 60 inches; dark red (2.5YR 3/6), red (2.5YR 4/6) and brown (7.5YR 4/4) cobbly clay; moderate fine angular blocky structure; firm; common very fine tubular pores; many prominent clay films of faces of peds and in pores; 20 percent chert cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4). (combined thickness of the 2Bt horizon is 20 to 45 inches or more)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Alred soils are on moderately sloping to strongly sloping narrow ridgetops and moderately steep to very steep sideslopes of hills. They formed in cherty hillslope sediments and the underlying clayey residuum.  Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent. Elevations are commonly 600 to 1,050 feet.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bardley, Bendavis, Gasconade, Goss, Lecoma, Mano, and Ocie soils.  Bardley soils are moderately deep to dolomite, have a very fine particle size control section and on are similar positions.  Bendavis soils are moderately deep to chert bedrock, have a loamy-skeletal particle size control section and are on lower side slopes.  Gasconade soils are very shallow and shallow to dolomite and are on similar positions.  Goss soils have a clayey-skeletal and are on similar landscape positions.  Lecoma soils have a fine-loamy particle size control section and are on high stream terraces below the Alred soils. Mano soils are moderately well drained and are on similar positions.  Ocie soils are moderately well drained, have bedrock from 40 to 60 inches in depth and are on similar landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Runoff is high to very high. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the profile and slow in the lower part.  The saturated hydraulic conducivity is moderately high over moderately low.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used mainly for timber production. Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods. A few areas have been cleared and are used for hay and pasture. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Ozark Highlands area of southern Missouri and northern Arkansas (MLRA 116A). The series is of large extent, almost a half a million acres have been mapped to date.
