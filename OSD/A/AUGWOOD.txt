AUGWOOD SERIES

The Augwood series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in 100 to 150 centimeters of sandy outwash deposits over till. These soils are on moraines and drumlins.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 825 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, frigid Typic Epiaquods

TYPICAL PEDON:  Augwood loamy sand, on a linear, northeast-facing slope of 1 percent, in a balsam fir forest, on the lower side slope of an outwash-veneered drumlin, at an elevation of about 457 meters above sea level.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

Vilas--are on higher landscape positions and do not have a frequently saturated zone within a depth of 1.8 meters during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of 30 year mean of annual precipitation

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--somewhat poorly drained--a frequently saturated zone occurs between depths of 0.15 to 0.60 meter during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of 30 year mean of annual precipitation, this saturation is considered perched
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--42.00 to 141.00 micrometers per second in the sandy outwash materials and 1.00 to 4.00 micrometers per second in the underlying till

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are forested.  A few areas are pastured.  Mature forests are mostly red maple, red pine, paper birch, quaking aspen, and balsam fir, but yellow birch, eastern hemlock, eastern white pine, jack pine, and northern red oak.
