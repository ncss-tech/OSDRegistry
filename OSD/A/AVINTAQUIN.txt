AVINTAQUIN SERIES

The Avintaquin series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived from limestone.  Depth to hard limestone is 50 to 100 cm.  Avintaquin soils are on mountain slopes and dip slopes.  Slopes range from 8 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 450 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 5.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Avintaquin very channery loam, on a north facing mountain slope, 10 percent slope, in sagebrush rangeland at an elevation of 2,225 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on June 26, 2003 the soil was slightly moist.

    A--0 to 18 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) very channery loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium and coarse roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel, 25 percent channers, 15 percent flagstones, 2 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (16 to 25 cm thick) 

    Bk1--18 to 42 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely channery clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium roots; common very fine and fine, and few medium tubular pores; common moderately thick (1-2mm) pale brown (10YR 6/3) calcium carbonate coats on the bottom of rock fragments; strongly effervescent (17 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); 10 percent sub-rounded gravel, 35 percent channers, 20 percent flagstones;  slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  

    Bk2--42 to 74 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) extremely channery clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and medium roots; common very fine and few fine tubular pores; many thin (<1mm) and moderately thick (1-2mm) very pale brown (10YR 7/3) calcium carbonate coats around rock fragments; violently effervescent (42 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); 50 percent channers, 30 percent flagstones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (The combined thickness of the Bk horizons is 25 to 56 cm thick)

    R--74 cm; hard fractured limestone bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Aguja, Finleypoint, Flott, Kutler, Labre, Perma, Peso, Peswyo, Renegade, Sandia, Slimbutte, Subwell, Towave, Veatch, Vigilante, Walstead, Wanagan, and Wimper series.  Aquja, Kutler, Peso, Pesowyo, Renegade, Sandia, Veatch, and Vigilante soils do not have Calcic Horizons.  Finleypoint, Flott, Labre, Perma, Slimbutte, Subwell, Towave, Walstead, Wanagan, and Wimper soils have bedrock deeper than 150 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium over residuum derived from limestone.
Landform:  mountain slopes and dip slopes.
Slopes:  8 to 15 percent.
Elevation:  2,150 to 2,410 meters.
Mean annual temperature:  4.5 to 6.0 degrees.
Mean annual precipitation:  400 to 530 mm.
Precipitation pattern: Wettest months are October to May and driest months are June to September.  The soil moisture regime is Typic Ustic.  Frost-free Period:  70 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brycan, Floak and Paunsaugunt series.  The Brycan soils formed in alluvium and are in drainage ways.  Floak soils have an argillic horizon and are in more concave positions.  The Paunsaugunt soils are shallow to bedrock and are on ridges.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, medium to high runoff, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Avintaquin soils are primarily used for grazing as native rangeland.  Native vegetation consists of mountain big sagebrush, Utah serviceberry, snowberry, bitterbrush, Salina wildrye, wheat grass, blue grass, needle grass and Oregon grape.  Utah correlates this soil to Mountain Stony Loam (Browse) 048AY451UT range site.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Utah Mountains; LRR E, MLRA 48A. The series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES PROPOSED: Utah County, Utah, 2015.  Duchesne Area soil survey.  The name Avintaquin comes from a canyon in the area where the soil is mapped.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
The surface is covered by 15 percent gravel, 25 percent channers, 5 percent flagstones and 3 percent stones.  Fragments are limestone.
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 74 cm.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 25 to 74 cm.  (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 18 cm.  (A horizon)
Calcic horizon:  The zone from 18 to 74 cm.  (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)
Lithic contact:  Limestone at 74 cm.  (R horizon)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.  The upper 18cm of the soil after mixing is non-calcareous, which defaults the classification to Haplustolls, rather than Calciustolls. 

Taxonomic Version:  Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.
