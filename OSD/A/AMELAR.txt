AMELAR SERIES

The Amelar series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from limestone, sandstone, and shale. Amelar soils are on hills, mountains, fan remnants, and partial ballenas. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Argixerolls

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Broad, Custco, Drage, Rawnjay, Remount, Scalfar, Searla, Sheep Creek, Small, and Swampydraw series.

Broad, Sheep Creek and Small soils are less than 100 cm deep to bedrock. Custco, Drage, Scalfar and Swampydraw soils are noneffervescent and lack secondary calcium carbonate concretions and pendants on coarse fragments in the A and Bt horizons.Rawnjay soils have calcic horizons with 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. Remount have 10 to 18 percent clay and 60 to 85 percent rock fragments in the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Amelar soils are on hills, mountains, fan remnants, and partial ballenas.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from limestone, sandstone, and calcareous shale. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. Elevations are 2,070 to 2,900 meters. The climate is dry-subhumid, with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 500 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Eoj and Xine soils.  Eoj soils have 50 to 60 percent clay in the Bt horizon.  Xine soils are 50 to 100 cm deep to bedrock and lack argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Amelar soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The potential native vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, serviceberry, bluebunch wheatgrass, singleleaf pinyon and scattered Utah juniper. This site is correlated to Ecological Site R028BY088NV Calcareous Loam 14-16 P.Z.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Nevada; MLRA 28B. These soils are moderately extensive.
