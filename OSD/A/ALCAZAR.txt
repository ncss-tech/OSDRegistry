ALCAZAR SERIES

The Alcazar series consists of very deep, well drained moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in alluvium.  These level soils are on flood plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, thermic Typic Torrifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Alcazar loam--cropland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

        Ap--0 to 46 centimeters (0.0 to 18.1 inches); light brown (7.5YR 6/4) crushed loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) crushed, moist; 51 percent sand; 38 percent silt; 11 percent clay; weak medium subangular blocky structure; noncemented, nonsticky, nonplastic; moderate excavation difficulty; common fine roots throughout; electrical conductivity of 5.0 mmhos/cm by ec meter, 1:1 water; strong effervescence, by HCl, 1 normal; moderately alkaline, pH 8.4, pH meter 1:1 water; gradual smooth boundary. Lab sample # D7377. (15 to 30 inches thick)

        C--46 to 203 centimeters (18.1 to 79.9 inches); light brown (7.5YR 6/4) crushed stratified loamy fine sand, brown (7.5YR 4/4) crushed, moist; 87 percent sand; 9 percent silt; 4 percent clay; massive; noncemented, nonsticky, nonplastic; moderate excavation difficulty; electrical conductivity of 1.4 mmhos/cm by ec meter, 1:1 water; strong effervescence, by HCl, 1 normal; moderately alkaline, pH 8.1, pH meter 1:1 water; common thin (.5 to 2 inch thick) pink (7.5YR 7/3) crushed strata of fine sand and loamy very fine sand, brown (7.5YR 5/3) crushed, moist. Lab sample # D7378.

TYPE LOCATION: El Paso County, Texas; from the junction of Interstate 10 and Highway 20 at the Mesa exit, 3.1 miles north on Highway 20; 2172 feet west in field.  Canutillo USGS 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle.  Latitude 31 degrees 52 minutes 33.69 seconds north and longitude 106 degrees 35 minutes 59.40 seconds west.  UTM zone 13, 348671E, 3527622N; NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture: Typic aridic soil moisture regime. The moisture control section is usually dry in all parts more than three-fourths of the time that the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F.

Mean annual soil temperature: 63 to 67 degrees F.

Particle-size control section (weighted average):
Contains contrasting textures:

Upper part:
Clay content: 8 to 17 percent

Lower part:
Clay content: 0.7 to 7 percent

Ap horizon:
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist 
Chroma: 2 to 4, dry or moist
Clay content: 8 to 17 percent
Rock fragments: 0 to less than 1 percent

C horizon: 
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist 
Chroma: 2 to 4, dry or moist 
Texture: loamy fine sand with few to many thin strata of very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam
Clay content: 0.7 to 7 percent 
Rock fragments: 0 to less than 1 percent
Stratification:  Usually .5 to 3 inches thick consisting of finer or coarser material.   Some strata may range to 7 inches thick.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: coarse-silty mixed alluvium over sandy mixed alluvium deposited by water
Landform: flood plain, protected by large dams
Slope: 0 to 1 percent
Mean annual air temperature: 62 to 66 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 8 to 10 inches
Precipitation pattern: precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September. The driest months are March and April. Precipitation during the months of January, February, and March is less than 13 percent of the total.
Frost-free period: 200 to 240 days
Elevation: 3,600 to 3,800 feet

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Fabens, Isla, Lantana, Riverway, Tigua, and Ysleta soils. 
Fabens soils are clayey over loamy and are on similar positions.
Isla soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and are on similar positions.
Lantana soils coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and are on similar positions.
Riverway soils are fine-loamy and are on similar positions.
Tigua soils are very-fine and are on similar positions.
Ysleta soils are sandy and are on similar positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderately rapid.  Runoff is negligible. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for irrigated crops. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Rio Grande Valley of Texas and southern New Mexico; LRR D, MLRA 42; small extent.
