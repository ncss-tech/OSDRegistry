ADE SERIES

The Ade series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in wind and water deposited sands.  These soils are on terraces and uplands and have slopes ranging from 1 to 12 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 54 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 41 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Lamellic Argiudolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ade loamy fine sand - on a 7 percent slope in a cultivated field.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Ap--0 to 10 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) loamy fine sand, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; weak fine granular structure; very friable; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)

   A--10 to 19 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loamy fine sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; very friable; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 15 inches thick)

   Bw--19 to 35 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) fine sand; single grain; loose; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 20 inches thick)

   E and Bt--35 to 60 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) fine sand (E); single grain; loose; lamellae of brown (7.5YR 4/4) sandy loam (Bt), about 4 inches apart and 1 to 2 inches thick; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (15 to 30 inches thick)

   C--60 to 70 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) fine sand; single grain; loose; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Sullivan County, Indiana; 1,720 feet east and 100 feet south of the northwest corner of sec. 2, T. 6 N., R. 10 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 54 to 77 inches.  Depth to lamellae ranges from 30 to 45 inches.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or fine sand and strongly acid to slightly acid.

The Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loamy fine sand or fine sand and is medium acid or strongly acid.

The E part of the E and Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sand or fine sand.  The Bt (lamellae) has hue of 7.5YR or l0YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loamy sand, sandy loam, or loam averaging less than l5 percent clay.

The C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is slightly acid to mildly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  Series in closely related families are Bloomfield and Elston.  Bloomfield soils do not have a mollic epipedon.  Elston soils have continuous argillic horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ade soils are on nearly level to gently rolling dune like topography.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.  Ade soils formed in wind and water deposited sands on terraces and uplands.  Mean annual temperature is 49 to 57 degrees F, mean annual precipitation is 36 to 44 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the well drained Ayr, Bloomfield, Dickinson, Elston, and Stockland soils.  Ayr soils are fine-loamy and are on nearby till plains.  Bloomfield soils do not have mollic epipedons and are on higher topographic positions.  Dickinson soils have continuous argillic horizons and are on similar topographic positions.  Elston soils are on nearby landscapes and do not have banded argillic horizons.  Stockland soils are on nearby landscapes and are loamy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONTIVITY:  Somewhat excessively drained.  Runoff is slow.  Permeability is rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used dominantly for cropland and meadow.  Common crops are corn, wheat, rye, and minor amount of special crops such as mellons.  Native vegetation was tall prairie grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Indiana and Illinois.  Series is of moderate extent.
