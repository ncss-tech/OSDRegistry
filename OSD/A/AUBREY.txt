AUBREY SERIES

The Aubrey series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in acid clay shales.  The soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep erosional uplands. Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, semiactive, thermic Typic Haplustults

TYPICAL PEDON:  Aubrey fine sandy loam--wooded pasture.(Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

	A--0 to 6 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable; common fine and medium roots; few fine pores; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. (3 to 8 inches thick)

	Bt1--6 to 20 inches; red (2.5YR 4/6) clay, dark red (2.5YR 3/6) moist; moderate medium blocky structure; very hard, very firm; few fine and medium roots; few clay films on surface of peds; very strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (7 to 19 inches thick)

	Bt2--20 to 27 inches; red (2.5YR 4/6) and gray (5YR 5/1) mottled clay; moderate medium blocky structure; very hard, very firm; few fine roots; few clay films on surface of peds; common light gray (5YR 7/1)shale fragments; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 15 inches thick)

	Cr--27 to 66 inches; light gray (5YR 7/1) very shaly clay, gray(5YR 6/1) moist; common thin strata of strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) loamy earth; massive; extremely hard, very firm; very strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION: Denton County, Texas; about 3 miles east of Aubrey, Texas, on FR 428 to intersection of FR 2931, 1.7 miles south on FR 2931, 250 feet east in wooded pasture.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The control section is clay with clay content of 40 to 60 percent.  The base saturation ranges from 18 to 35 percent in the lower Bt horizon.

The A horizon is dark brown, brown, or light brown, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 2 to 4, in hue of 7.5YR and 10YR.  It is fine sandy loam, loam; stony phases are recognized.  Reaction ranges from medium acid through neutral.  A thin E horizon that is 1 or 2 units of value lighter in color than the A horizon is present in some pedons.

The Bt horizons are red, light red, yellowish red, reddish brown, reddish yellow, or brown, values of 4 to 6, chroma of 4 to 6, in hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR.  Mottles of red, yellowish red, brown, strong brown, gray, or brownish gray range from none to few in upper Bt horizons and few to many in the lower Bt horizons.  The gray mottles are inherited from the gray shale.  Texture is clay with clay content ranging from 40 to 60 percent.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid through medium acid.

The Cr horizon is stratified and mottled in shades of red, brown, gray, and yellow.  It is shaly clay or very shaly clay.  In some pedons the shaly Cr horizon contains thin bands of weakly cemented sandstone and bands of unconsolidated earth.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid through neutral.

COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Hearne and Marquez series in the same family and the similar Birome and Truce series.  Birome soils have more than 35 percent base saturation and are underlain by sandstone at 20 to 40 inches depth.  Hearne soils do not have a paralithic contact of shale and have mica flakes in the C horizon.  They also formed in Tertiary Age parent materials.  Marquez soils have sola 40 to 60 inches thick.  Truce soils have a base saturation of more than 35 percent and in addition have sola more than 40 inches thick.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The gently sloping to moderately steep Aubrey soils are on ridges and low hills mainly in the East Cross Timbers Land Resource Area of northcentral Texas.  Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent.  These soils formed in acid shaley clays mainly in the Lewisville member of the Woodbine Formation of Upper Cretaceous Age.  Climate is moist subhumid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 40 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 66 degrees to 68 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from 52 to 64.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Birome series, as well as the Callisburg and Rayex series.  Callisburg soils are more than 60 inches deep.  Rayex soils have a contact to sandstone at depths of less than 20 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for rangeland.  Vegetation is noncommercial hardwood forests of scrub post oak and blackjack oak with scattered Eastern redcedar and elm.  Native grasses consists of Florida paspalum, panicums, wildrye, little bluestem, purpletop, sideoats grama, and threeawn.  Mesquite invades some areas.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mainly in the East Cross Timbers Area of northcentral Texas.  The series is inextensive.
