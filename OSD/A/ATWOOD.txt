ATWOOD SERIES

The Atwood series consist of very deep, well drained soils that formed in a mantle of silty material and the underlying loamy sediments of marine origin. Atwood soils are on hills of the Southern Coastal Plain. Slopes range from 0 to 17 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 142 to 147 centimeters (56 to 58 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 17 degrees C (62 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, semiactive, thermic Typic Paleudalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Atwood silt loam - cultivated.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches): brown (7.5YR 4/4) silt loam; weak fine and medium granular structure; friable; common fine roots; few worm casts, some material from B horizon as fillings in worm holes and root channels; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. [10 to 23 centimeters (4 to 9 inches) thick]

 Bt1--15 to 46 centimeters (6 to 18 inches); dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) silty clay loam; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly plastic; few fine roots; few fine black concretions; few root channels filled with material from Ap horizon; patchy clay films on faces of peds and in root channels; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.

 Bt2--46 to 79 centimeters (18 to 31 inches): dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) silty clay loam; moderate medium and coarse subangular and angular blocky structure; friable, slightly plastic; few fine roots; common fine and coarse black coatings; many fine black concretions; clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; few root channels and worm holes filled with material from Ap horizon; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.

 Bt3--79 to 114 centimeters (31 to 45 inches); dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) silty clay loam; moderate medium and coarse subangular and angular blocky structure; friable, slightly plastic; few fine roots; common fine to coarse black coatings; common fine black concretions; clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; few root channels filled with material from Ap horizon; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.

 Bt4--114 to 145 centimeters (45 to 57 inches); dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) silty clay loam; moderate medium and coarse subangular and angular blocky structure; friable, slightly plastic; few fine roots; common fine black concretions; clay films on faces of peds and in pores; strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 86 to 152 centimeters (34 to 60 inches) or more.]

 2Bt--145 to 201 centimeters (57 to 79 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/6) clay loam; moderate medium and coarse subangular and angular blocky structure; friable, slightly plastic; few fine black coatings; few concretions; patchy clay films on faces of peds and in pores; slightly acid.
