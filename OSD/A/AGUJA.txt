AGUJA SERIES

The Aguja series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in colluvium from tuff.  These strongly sloping to steep soils are on mountain tops, flanks and bases.  Slope ranges from 35 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Dona Ana County, New Mexico; 2001.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section: The zone from 10 to 35 inches.  (Bw2 and C horizons)
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 8 inches. (A and Bw1 horizons).
Cambic horizon: 2 to 15 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).

The assignment of the cation exchange capacity is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
