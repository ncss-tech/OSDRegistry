AGUDO SERIES

The Agudo series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in moderately fine textured calcareous alluvium derived from siltstone, shale and sandstone. These soils are on alluvial fan terraces, valley side slopes and playa slopes. Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 356 mm (14 in), and mean annual temperature is 15 degrees C. (59 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the similar Berwolf, Evanola (NM), Kolar, Neso and Redona series.
Berwolf, Evanola and Redona soils: are on higher landscape positions and have argillic horizons.
Kolar and Neso soils: are on higher landscape positions and have petrocalcic horizons.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used primarily for rangeland. Native climax vegetation is mid and short grasses, with mid grasses tending to dominate. This site is dominated by blue grama. The remainder is mid and short grasses such as sideoats grama, sand dropseed, buffalograss, and perennial threeawn. Broom snakeweed, bullnettle, cholla and yucca are also present. This soil has been correlated to the Limy (R070BY068NM) ecological site in MLRA-70B.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Upper Pecos River Valley (MLRA 70B in LRR G) of eastern New Mexico. The series is moderately extensive.
