MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Appomattox County, Virginia, 1993. 

REMARKS: The parent material of Appomattox soils has substantial amounts of gibbsite and is high in oxides, however, mineralogical analysis does not support a oxidic versus mixed family. 
Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 6 inches (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 6 to 65 inches (Bt horizon)
Aquic conditions--periodic saturation and reduction within 36 to 60 inches of the soil surface, and one or more unsaturated layers within 80 inches of the surface, occurring below the periodically saturated zone (episaturation) 
Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Lithologic discontinuity-
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 80 inches 

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Laboratory Data: Laboratory analysis of 16 pedons has been completed by Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia.
