AMBROSECREEK SERIES

The Ambrosecreek series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources. These soils are on stream terraces and inset fans. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Ambrosecreek sandy loam, in rangeland on a 2 percent slope at 1,018 meters elevation (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise indicated.)

    A--0 to 18 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; very friable, soft, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and medium roots; many fine irregular and tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (18 to 36 cm thick)

    Bw--18 to 41 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable, soft, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; many fine irregular and tubular pores; 2 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual smooth boundary.  (20 to 53 cm thick)

    C1--41 to 71 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) sandy loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; massive; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (15 to 38 cm thick)

    C2--71 to 127 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) coarse sand, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt wavy boundary.

    C3--127 to 152 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) very gravelly coarse sand, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine interstitial pores; 55 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8).
