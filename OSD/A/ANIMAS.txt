ANIMAS SERIES

The Animas series consists of somewhat poorly drained soils formed in material weathered from igneous rock deposited over clayey shale. Animas soils are on hummock.  Slopes range from 4 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 40 to 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.  Typically, Animas soils have dark gray and dark grayish brown A1 horizons, gravelly sandy loam B2t horizons, and strongly mottled C1g horizons overlying shale at 38 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Aquic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Animas loam - forest.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    01--1 to 0 inches; undecomposed twigs, needles, bark, and other woody and herbaceous material.  (0 to 1 inch thick)

    All--0 to 5 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; strong medium granular structure parting to moderate fine granules; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many medium and coarse roots; slightly acid; gradual irregular boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)

    A12--5 to 12 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; common medium distinct dark brown (10YR 5/6) mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to strong medium granules; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 5 percent igneous gravel; common fine and medium roots; slightly acid; gradual irregular boundary.  (3 to 7 inches thick)

    B2t--12 to 23 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) gravelly sandy clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; common fine strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) mottles, moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, sticky and plastic; 15 percent igneous gravel; few fine and medium roots; thin patchy clay films; medium acid; gradual irregular boundary.  (7 to 13 inches thick)

    C1--23 to 38 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; common medium distinct dark brown (7.5YR 3/2), strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), and greenish gray (5GY 5/1) mottles; massive; very hard, very firm, sticky, and plastic; 15 percent gravel, 10 percent stones; few fine roots; medium acid.  (12 to 20 inches thick)

    Cr--38 to 50 inches; clay shale.

TYPE LOCATION:  Archuleta County, Colorado; Sec. 4, T. 36 N., R. 1 E., NMPM.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to shale ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Volume of igneous gravel ranges from 0 to 35 percent throughout the soil.

The loam or sandy loam A1 horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.

The B2t and C1 horizons have textures of sandy clay loam or clay loam that contain from 25 to 35 percent clay.  These horizons have hue of 7.5YR through 5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.

The C horizon has common to many distinct mottles.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Hunchback and Wallrock soils.  Hunchback soils lack an argillic horizon.  Wallrock soils have no bedrock at depths of less than 40 inches and have hue of 10YR through 5Y in the B2t and C horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Animas soils are on hummocky terrain on gradients of 4 to 65 percent.  The soils developed in material weathered from igneous rock deposited over clayey shale.  Elevation ranges from 6,500 to 10,000 feet.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 38 degrees F, and mean summer tempeature is 54 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Castelleia and Grenadier series.  They lack mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; moderately permeable.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for timber production and wildlife habitat.  Principal vegetation is Engelmann spruce, white fir, and aspen.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Colorado.  The series is of small extent.
