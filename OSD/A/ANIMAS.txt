ANIMAS SERIES

The Animas series consists of somewhat poorly drained soils formed in material weathered from igneous rock deposited over clayey shale. Animas soils are on hummocks.  Slopes range from 4 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1,000 to 1,100 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Aquic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Animas loam - forest.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 3 cm; undecomposed twigs, needles, bark, and other woody and herbaceous material.  (0 to 3 cm thick)

    A1--3 to 16 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; strong medium granular structure parting to moderate fine granules; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many medium and coarse roots; slightly acid; gradual irregular boundary.  (5 to 15 cm thick)

    A2--16 to 33 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to strong medium granules; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 5 percent igneous gravel; common fine and medium roots; slightly acid; gradual irregular boundary.  (8 to 18 cm thick)

    Bt--33 to 61 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; common fine strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) mottles, moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, sticky and plastic; 15 percent igneous gravel; few fine and medium roots; thin patchy clay films; moderately acid; gradual irregular boundary.  (18 to 33 cm thick)

    C--61 to 100 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; common medium distinct dark brown (7.5YR 3/2), strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), and greenish gray (5GY 5/1) mottles; massive; very hard, very firm, sticky, and plastic; 15 percent gravel, 10 percent stones; few fine roots; moderately acid.  (30 to 50 cm thick)

    Cr--100 to 130 cm; clay shale.
