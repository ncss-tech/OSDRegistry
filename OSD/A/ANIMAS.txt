ANIMAS SERIES

The Animas series consists of somewhat poorly drained soils formed in material weathered from igneous rock deposited over clayey shale. Animas soils are on hummocks.  Slopes range from 4 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1,020 to 1,145 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.  Typically, Animas soils have dark gray and dark grayish brown A1 horizons, gravelly sandy loam B2t horizons, and strongly mottled C1g horizons overlying shale at about 100 cm.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Aquic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Animas loam - forest.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 3 cm; undecomposed twigs, needles, bark, and other woody and herbaceous material.  (0 to 3 cm thick)

    A11--3 to 16 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; strong medium granular structure parting to moderate fine granules; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many medium and coarse roots; slightly acid; gradual irregular boundary.  (5 to 15 cm thick)

    A12--16 to 33 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to strong medium granules; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 5 percent igneous gravel; common fine and medium roots; slightly acid; gradual irregular boundary.  (8 to 18 cm thick)

    B2t--33 to 61 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; common fine strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) mottles, moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, sticky and plastic; 15 percent igneous gravel; few fine and medium roots; thin patchy clay films; medium acid; gradual irregular boundary.  (18 to 33 cm thick)

    C1--61 to 100 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; common medium distinct dark brown (7.5YR 3/2), strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), and greenish gray (5GY 5/1) mottles; massive; very hard, very firm, sticky, and plastic; 15 percent gravel, 10 percent stones; few fine roots; medium acid.  (30 to 50 cm thick)

    Cr--100 to 130 cm; clay shale.

TYPE LOCATION:  Archuleta County, Colorado; Sec. 4, T. 36 N., R. 1 E., NMPM.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to shale ranges from 50 to 100 cm.  Volume of igneous gravel ranges from 0 to 35 percent throughout the soil.

The loam or sandy loam A1 horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.

The B2t and C1 horizons have textures of sandy clay loam or clay loam that contain from 25 to 35 percent clay.  These horizons have hue of 7.5YR through 5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.

The C horizon has common to many distinct mottles.
