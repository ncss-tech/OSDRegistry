ANNTON SERIES

The Annton series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy, calcareous, friable till and in the underlying firm till.

The mean annual precipitation is about 735 millimeters.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Cottonwood County, Minnesota, 2009.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters; series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon are:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 25 centimeters (Ap horizons); 
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 25 to 56 centimeters and the zone from a depth of 152 to 203 centimeters (Bw and BC horizons); 
calcic horizon--the zone from a depth of 56 to 152 centimeters (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons);
udic moisture regime. 

Some pedons have a sandy or coarse-loamy lag line, about 10 centimeters thick, with or without gravel at the contact with the underlying firm till.

The BC horizon is defined by having prismatic primary structure parting to angular or subangular blocky.  This structure is evident in pits and cutbanks and rarely observed by smaller scale investigations. The change in moist bulk density of 1.45 to 1.65 g/cc was based on lab data of soils that are similar and field investigations by soil scientist in this geomorphic landform of the Coteau des Prairies bench". 

Based on current investigations, elevation ranges in MLRA 103 is about 270 to 480 meter above sea level. However, the elevation data in the 2006 issue of USDA Handbook 296, has not been changed to agree with this elevation data.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
