ACROPH SERIES


The Acroph series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in tephra over residuum from andesite, dacite and rhyodacite. Acroph soils are on scoured glacial-valley walls and floors and roche moutenees in the southern Cascade mountains. Slopes range from 5 to 80 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 107 inches (2718 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F (5 degrees C).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-skeletal, glassy Lithic Vitricryands

TYPICAL PEDON: Acroph ashy highly organic sand, on a south facing (180 degrees) slope of 18 percent, under a cover of pinemat manzanita, California red fir, western white pine, and mountain hemlock at an elevation of 7958 feet, (2426 m). When described on 7/24/2007, the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Acroph soils are on scoured glacial-valley walls and floors and roche moutenees in the southern Cascade mountains. Slopes are 5 to 80 percent. These soils formed in tephra over residuum weathered from andesite, dacite and rhyodacite. Elevation is 5720 to 8512 feet (1744 to 2595 m). Mean annual precipitation is 55 to 117 inches (1397 to 2972 mm). The mean annual temperature is 39 to 43 degrees F (4 to 6 degrees C). Frost free season is 50 to 85 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Terracelake and Shadowlake soils. The Terracelake soils are moderately deep to bedrock and are on similar glacially scoured positions. Shadowlake soils are deep to dense till, and are on linear and concave positions where glacial till was deposited.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for wildlife habitat, recreation, ecosystem management and watershed. Vegetation is pinemat manzanita, California red fir, western white pine, and mountain hemlock.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The soils are inextensive and are mapped in MLRA: 22B, Southern Cascade Mountains.
