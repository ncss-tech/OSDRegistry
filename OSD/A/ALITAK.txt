COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ekiligamut (AK), Graylake (ID), Mariel (OR), Snakeriver (AK), and Wocus (OR) series.
Ekiligamut soils have marine deposits in the substratum, have mean annual precipitation less than 800 mm ( 32 in), have frost free periods of greater than 85 days, and occur in tidal marshes.
Graylake soils have mean annual precipitation less than 550 mm (22 in), have frost free periods greater than 50 days, and occur in bogs of mountain basins.
Mariel soils have mean annual temperatures greater than 6 degrees C. (43 degrees F.), have frost-free periods greater than 50 days, and occur in fens or bogs, they also may have mineral substratum since it is only described to 150cm (60 in).
Snakeriver soils have mean annual air temperature of less than -2 degress C. (27.5 degrees F.), have frost free periods greater than 50 days, and occur on outwash plains and drift plains.
Wocus soils have diatomaceous earth substratum, have frost free epriods less than 20 days, and occur on flood plains.
