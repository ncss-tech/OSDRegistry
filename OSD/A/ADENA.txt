ADENA SERIES

The Adena series consists of very deep, well drained, slow or medium permeable soils formed in eolian materials. These nearly level to very gently sloping uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 to 16 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Ustic Paleargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Adena loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

  A--0 to 3 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) light loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 4 inches thick)

  Bt--3 to 9 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) light clay, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong fine prismatic structure parting to strong fine angular blocky structure; extremely hard, friable, sticky and plastic; medium continuous clay films on peds; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 7 inches thick)

  Bk--9 to 12 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium and fine prismatic structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; visible secondary calcium carbonate as concretions, and in finely divided forms; calcareous; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary. (3 to 4 inches thick)

  Ck1--12 to 24 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) heavy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; hard, very friable, slightly sticky; visible calcium carbonate occurring as concretions, and in finely divided forms; calcareous; moderately alkaline; diffuse wavy boundary. (12 to 20 inches thick)

  Ck2--24 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; hard, friable; some visible calcium carbonate occurring as concretions, and in thin seams and streaks; calcareous; moderately alkaline.  (Several feet thick)

TYPE LOCATION: Morgan County, Colorado; approximately 90 feet north and 150 feet west of the SE corner of Sec. 36, T. 5 N., R. 58 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Mean annual soil temperature: 50 degrees F.
Depth to solum: 8 to 15 inches 
Depth to secondary calcium carbonate: 5 to 10 inches 

Particle-size control section (weighted average): 
Clay content: 16 to 25 percent
Sand content: 10 to 25 percent

A horizon:
Hue: 2.5Y or 10YR 
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist 
Chroma: 1.5 through 3
Reaction: neutral or moderately alkaline 

B horizon:
Hue: 2.5Y or 10YR 
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist 
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: light clay, silty clay or clay loam 
Reaction: neutral or moderately alkaline 

Ck horizon:
Hue: 2.5Y or 10YR 
Reaction: moderately or strongly alkaline 
Note: It has 8 to 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.

COMPETING SERIES:
Currently there are no competing series.
 
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent Material: eolian materials 
Landform: nearly level to very gently sloping table lands 
Slope: 0 to about 6 percent 
Mean annual precipitation: 11 to 16 inches 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Baca, Campo, Colby, Stoneham, Ulysses, and Weld soils.
Baca and Campo soils have sola thicker than 15 inches.
Colby soils lack an argillic horizon.
Ulysses and Weld soils have mollic epipedons.
Stoneham soils lack an abrupt textural change between the A and B horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage: well drained
Runoff: low to medium
Permeability: slow in the B2t horizon; below the B2t horizon is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION: The soils are used both as dry cropland and as native pastureland.  Principal native vegetation is short grasses, mainly blue
grama.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: East-central Colorado.  The series has moderate extent.
