SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Distribution:  The Northern Coastal Plain and Northern Tidewater Area of New Jersey 
Extent: Large

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Gloucester County, New Jersey, 1960 

REMARKS: 
02/2000--The family particle-size class was revised from fine-loamy to coarse-loamy based on recent particle-size analysis and field observations (Gloucester County, NJ).
05/1998.--Aura soils were previously classified as Typic Hapludults (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic) with a dense, root restrictive layer. The classification and series description is updated to include the revised fragipan concept. 
1998--In Cape May County, NJ Pittsgrove soils were correlated, with the completion of Gloucester County, NJ it was determined that Aura soils also dominantly had a coarse-loamy particle-size control section indicating no significant difference between Pittsgrove and Aura soils as mapped. It was the preference of the state to retain the Aura name and inactivate the Pittsgrove series. The soils mapped Pittsgrove have been re-correlated to the Aura series.

Diagnostic horizons and other soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 1.5 inches (4 centimeters) (A and E horizons) 
Argillic horizon--the zone from 8 to 60 inches (20 to 152 centimeters) (Bt and 2Btx horizons) 
Fragipan horizon--the zone from 22 to 60 inches (56 to 152 centimeters) (2Btx horizons) 
Lithologic Discontinuity--the zone from 22 to 80 inches (56 to 203 centimeters) (2Btx and 2C horizons) 

ADDITIONAL DATA: 
Reference particle-size data is available from the project soil survey staff, Hammonton, New Jersey.
