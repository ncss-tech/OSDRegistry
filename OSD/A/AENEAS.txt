AENEAS SERIES

The Aeneas series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess mixed with glacial outwash. The Aeneas soils are on glacial outwash terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.  and the mean annual precipitation is about 275 mm. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haploxerolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Aeneas fine sandy loam in rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

A1--0 to 5 centimeters (0 to 2 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 25 cm thick) 

A2--5 to 20 centimeters (2 to 8 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (13 to 25 cm thick)

(15 to 36 cm thick) 

C1--41 to 66 centimeters (16 to 26 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual smooth boundary. (23 to 41 cm thick) 

2C2--66 to 76 centimeters (26 to 30 inches); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loamy sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; single grained; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt wavy boundary. (10 to 15 cm thick) 

2C3--76 to 152 centimeters (30 to 60 inches); multicolored sand, single grained; loose, few very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2). 

TYPE LOCATION: Okanogan County, Washington; about 3 miles northwest of the town of Monse; 23 m west and 15 m north of the southeast corner of the SE1/4 NE1/4 sec. 20, T.31N., R.25E.

Chroma: 1 to 4 dry or moist, or is multicolored 
Texture: loamy fine sand, loamy sand, sand, or coarse sand 
Structure: massive or single grained 
Gravel: 0 to 10 percent gravel 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Leavers and Pogue series. 
Leavers soils have few clay films and are dry for more than 115 consecutive days. 
Pogue soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the particle-size control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Aeneas soils are on glacial outwash terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent. The soils formed in loess mixed with glacial outwash deposited during Missoula flood events. Elevations are 250 to 575 m. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 250 mm to 300 mm. The mean January temperature is about -6.0 degrees C.,  the mean July temperature is about 22 degrees C., and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. The frost-free season is 130 to 165 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cashmere, Cashmont, Ewall, , Okanogan, Peshastin, Quincy, Skaha, and Strat soils and the competing Pogue soils. 
Cashmere soils are coarse-loamy and are on glacial outwash terraces
Cashmont soils are coarse-loamy and are on terraces
Ewall soils are sandy and are on terraces
Okanogan soils are coarse-loamy and are on flood plains and low strem terraces. 
Quincy soils are sandy are on dunes and terraces
Peshastin soils are loamy-skeletal glacial moraines and terraces
Skaha soils are sandy-skeletal are on terraces
Strat soils are loamy-skeletal and are on terraces.. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; runoff is slow to medium; high over very high. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Principal uses are cropland, livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Dry land small grains and irrigated tree fruit, hay and pasture are common crops. The native vegetation is bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, arrowleaf balsamroot, snow eriogonum, antelope bitterbrush, lupine, yarrow, and big sagebrush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North-central Washington; MLRA 8. The soils are of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Okanogan County, Washington, 1972. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil are: 
Mollic epipedon from the surface to 20 centimeters (8 inches) 
Cambic horizon from 20 to 41 centimeters (8 to 16 inches) 
A lithologic change to sandy material at 66 centimeters (26 inches) 

06/2015: Coordinates estimated from section, township, and range.

02/2015 The Aeneas OSD was updated as part of a SDJR project.  This soil most likely contains volcanic ash but the extent of the ash influence is unknown.  Lab sampling will be required to better understand the volcanic ash influence.  More work needs to be done describing roots, pores and structure.  The older 1972 Okanogan Survey described prismatic structure that may not be present.
