REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features in this pedon
*Particle-size control section--zone from 18 to 68 cm
*Ochric epipedon
*Argillic horizon--zone from 18 to 122 cm
*Aquic conditions--zone from 5 to 152 cm
*Depth to abrupt textural change--18 cm
*Depth to lithologic discontinuity--18 cm
*Slickensides--zone from 18 to 74 cm

The Awbrig soils are on the Winkle geomorphic surface in the Willamette Valley of Oregon. The lithologic discontinuity represents a change in parent material from alluvium deposited by the Willamette River and its tributaries to Missoula Flood sediment.

8/2017--This official series description was updated according to SSR01 Technical Note 11--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 11/2017). Most of the changes were in formatting. The competing series were updated, and the classification was updated from Vertic Albaqualfs to Chromic Vertic Albaqualfs. The high value of the Ap horizon when dry meets the criteria for Chromic Vertic Albaqualfs in the twelfth edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.
