 A--5 to 8 cm; silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt smooth boundary

 2Cg1--8 to 23 cm; loamy fine sand, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) dry, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 5 percent medium distinct dark brown (10YR 3/3) redoximorphic concentrations; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary

 2Cg2--23 to 58 cm; sand, gray (7.5YR 5/1) dry, very dark gray (7.5YR 3/1) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 1 percent fine faint dark brown (10YR 3/3) redoximorphic concentrations; common fine and medium roots; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt wavy boundary

 2Cg3--58 to 150 cm; sand, gray (7.5YR 5/1) dry, very dark gray (7.5YR 3/1) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and medium roots decreasing to few fine roots as depth increases; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4)

5/2020--A frequently ponded phase is mapped in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve. The Ashmun series includes the concepts of the former Stave series that was poorly defined. This official series description was updated according to SSR01 Technical Note-Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015). Most of the changes were in formatting, but the Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve area was included.
