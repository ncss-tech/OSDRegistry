ALICEVILLE SERIES


The Aliceville series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in a thin mantle of loess and the underlying residuum weathered from limestone of Pennsylvanian age. These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping summits and shoulders, and side slopes on interfluves on  plains in the Cherokee Prairies (MLRA 112). Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 880 mm (35 in.).  Mean annual temperature is 13 degrees C (55 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, thermic Oxyaquic Vertic Argiudolls

The R layer is hard fractured limestone bedrock that is tilted less than 20 degrees from horizontal. 

COMPETING SERIES: These is the Wagstaff series in the same family. The Wagstaff soils have limestone bedrock at depths of 50 to 100 cm. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Aliceville soils are on nearly level to gently sloping summits, shoulders, and side slopes on interfuves on the plains in the Cherokee Prairies.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  They formed in a thin mantle of loess and the underlying material weathered from limestone of Pennsylvanian age.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 880 mm to 1095 mm (35 to 43 in.) and is distributed throughout the year with May through July receiving the most precipitation usually during intense thunderstorms..  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 13 to 16 degrees C (55 to 62 degrees F).
 
GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Barden, Kenoma, and Summit, series.  All these soils are greater than 150 cm to bedrock and generally on the same landform as the Aliceville soils.  Barden soils occur mostly in the eastern extent, Kenoma soils in the central extent and Summit soils in the southern extent of the series.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained; saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part and moderately low in the lower part.  A layer of episaturation occurs intermittently during periods of high rainfall in most years at depths greater than 75 cm, duration is long enough to create redoximorphic concentrations but not of sufficient duration to create redoximorphic depletions.

USE AND VEGETATION: Aliceville soils are used for cultivated small grains, corn, grain sorghum, soybeans, and pasture.  Some areas are used for range and are in native tall grass prairies.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Cherokee Prairies (MLRA 112) of Oklahoma, Kansas, and Missouri.  The series is of moderate extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: 01/2008

REMARKS: These soils were formerly included in the Lula series in parts of Missouri, Kansas and Oklahoma.
Diagnostic features and horizons recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon  0 to 36 cm (0 to 14 in.)
Argillic horizon  36 to 128 cm (14 to 50 in.)
Redoximorphic concentrations  58 to 128 cm (23 to 50 in.)
Slickensides  110 to 128 cm (43 to 50 in.)
Linear extensibility greater than 6.0 cm within 100 cm.
Lithic contact  128 cm (50 in.)
The mean annual soil temperature at the type location and in the northern range of this series is slightly less than the 15 degree C break for thermic soils.  The MLRA 112 boundary crosses the mesic thermic areas and for classification MLRA 112 soils are considered thermic.
