DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Distribution: Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina, and Virginia. Altavista soils were correlated in older surveys in Pennsylvania, but those survey areas are outside the MLRA range.
Extent: Large

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Granville County, North Carolina; 1910.

REMARKS: Altavista soils are restricted to fluvial terraces. The 05/06 revision refined the textures of the C and Cg in the range of characteristics. The 03/06 revision dropped MLRA 153B.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 12 inches (the A and E horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 12 to a depth of 35 inches (the BE, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons)
Aquic subgroup feature--redoximorphic depletions with chroma of 2 or less within the upper 24 inches of the argillic horizon

ADDITIONAL DATA: None
