SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Distribution: Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. Altavista soils were correlated in older surveys in Pennsylvania, but those survey areas are outside the MLRA range.
Extent: Large

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Granville County, North Carolina; 1910.

REMARKS: Altavista soils are restricted to fluvial terraces. The 05/06 revision refined the textures of the C and Cg in the range of characteristics. The 03/06 revision dropped MLRA 153B.  The December 2025 revision changed the format and moved the type location from Wake County, North Carolina to Halifax County, North Carolina.  With the update of the Wake County soil survey, the type location no longer exists.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to a depth of 12 inches (the A and E horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 12 to a depth of 36 inches (the Bt  horizons)
Aquic subgroup feature--redoximorphic depletions with chroma of 2 or less within the upper 24 inches of the argillic horizon
