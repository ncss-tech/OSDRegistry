ANINTO SERIES

The Aninto series consists of well drained, very deep soils that formed in alluvium from mica schist, quartzite, and welded tuff.  They are on fan terraces, toe slopes, and terrace sideslopes.  Permeability is very slow.  Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 360 mm, and the average annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, frigid Typic Palexerolls

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Amboat, Durfee, Ebic, and Ziram series.  Amboat soils have an average annual soil temperature of 41 to 43 degrees F., and a Bt2 horizon that averages 60 to 85 percent clay, and 60 to 85 percent stones.    Durfee soils have argillic horizons that extend to depths of more than 150 cm and lack discontinuities in the lower part of the profile.  Ebic soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Ziram soils have secondary carbonates at 41 to 69 cm, and a soil reaction that is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Aninto soils are on fan terraces and terrace sideslopes.  The slope ranges from 1 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium from mica schist, quartzite, and welded tuff.  Elevations are 1,680 to 1,985 meters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches.  The average annual temperature is 5.6 to 6.7 degree C.  The frost free season is 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bancy, Chayson, Forvic, Oshone, and Zola soils.  Bancy soils are shallow to a hardpan and occur on terraces.  Chayson, Forvic, and Oshone soils are moderately deep to a hardpan, and occur on terraces.  Zola soils are fine-loamy, moderately well drained, and occur on lower alluvial terraces.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; very slow hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Aninto soils are used for rangeland.  Native vegetation is bluebunch wheatgrass, low sagebrush, mountain big sagebrush, and Idaho fescue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Aninto soils are of moderate extent in south central Idaho. MLRA 25.
