ASHPORT SERIES

The Ashport series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium of Holocene age. These soils are on flood plains along small streams in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 840 mm (33 in), and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, thermic Fluventic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ashport silty clay loam, in a cultivated field, at an elevation of 267 m (875 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  Ap--0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 in); dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2) silty clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard; firm; many fine roots; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (Thickness of the Ap horizon is 0 to 20 cm [0 to 8 in])

  A--13 to 41 cm (5 to 16 in); dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2) silty clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; many fine roots; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (Thickness of the A horizon is 0 to 41 cm [0 to 16 in])

  Bw--41 to 91 cm (16 to 36 in); reddish brown (5YR 5/4) silty clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate coarse subangular blocky; hard, firm; few fine roots; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. (Thickness of the Bw horizon is 36 to 137 cm [14 to 54 in])

  Ab--91 to 132 cm (36 to 52 in); dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2) loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium granular; slightly hard, friable; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary. (Thickness of the Ab horizon is 0 to 51 cm [0 to 20 in])

  Bwb1--132 to 168 cm (52 to 66 in); reddish brown (5YR 5/4) loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bwb horizon is 0 to 100 cm [0 to 40 in])

  Bwb2--168 to 200 cm (66 to 80 in); yellowish red (5YR 5/6) loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak coarse subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable; neutral.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Asher , Goodcreek , and Lamkin series in the same family. These soils all are calcareous throughout the 10- to 40-inch control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: loamy alluvium of Holocene age
Landscape: alluvial plain
Landform: flood plains 
Slope: 0 to 3 percent 
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 13.9 to 17.2 degrees C (57 to 63 degrees F)
Mean Annual Precipitation: 787 to 1041 mm (31 to 41 in)
Frost-Free Period: 181 to 230 days
Elevation: 213 to 475 meters (700 to 1600 ft)
Thornthwaite Annual P-E indices: 44 to 64

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dale, Port, and Pulaski series. 
Dale and Port soils: have a mollic epipedon more than 51 cm (20 in) thick. 
Dale soils: occur slightly higher flood plains that are rarely flooded. 
Port soils: occur on similar landforms, but are usually further from the stream channel.
Pulaski soils: have a coarse-loamy control section and occur on similar landforms, but are generally nearer to the stream channel.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  
Drainage: well drained 
Permeability: moderate 
Runoff: negligible 
Flooding:  occasionally or frequently flooded for very brief to brief periods during March to August

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly as cropland and hayland. Alfalfa, small grains, and grain sorghum are the most common crops. Some areas are used for improved pasture or livestock grazing. Native vegetation is big bluestem, switchgrass, Indiangrass, and little bluestem with an overstory of pecan, black walnut, bur oak, and eastern cottonwood trees. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Oklahoma; LRR H, MLRA 80A. The series is extensive.
