ANCO SERIES

The Anco series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks. Anco soils are on alluvial fans, alluvial flats and flood plains. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 225 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9.5 degrees C.

TYPE LOCATION: Sanpete County, Utah; about 1 mile north of Manti; 1,815 feet north and 400 feet east of the southwest corner of sec. 31, T.17S., R.3E.; Manti USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 17 minutes 24 seconds N and longetude 111 degrees 37 minutes 60 seconds W; NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Soil moisture: Usually dry; moist in winter and spring and for brief periods in late summer due to convection storms; aridic intergrading toward aquic soil moisture regime. The soils are saturated with water during some period of the year within 100 cm of the surface. Depth to the seasonal water table ranges from 75 to 175 cm or more. 
Mean annual soil temperature: 8.5 to 13.5 degrees C.
Organic matter content: Decreases irregularly with depth or remains above .35 percent to a depth of 125 cm. 
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 15 to 35 percent. 
Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.
Other features: The soils have chroma of 1 if not mottled, or chroma of 2 or less with mottles at some depth between 50 and 100 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 27 to 35 percent.
Sand content: averages less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand. 

A horizon
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 5 through 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3 (The surface 10 cm has dry value of less than 5.5 and moist value of less than 3.5 in some pedons.)

C horizon
Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y.
Value: 5 through 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist.
Chroma: 1 through 3.
Texture: Silty clay to silt loam but averages silty clay loam; below 100cm ranges from silty clay to sand.
Reaction: Strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Hunting series. Hunting soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Anco soils are on the lower part of alluvial fans, alluvial flats and flood plains at elevations of 1,372 to 1,770 meters. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. They formed in alluvium from limestone, shale and sandstone. The climate is semiarid. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 12 degrees C. Average annual precipitation ranges from 150 to 300 mm. Freeze-free period is 100 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Abcal, Duggins, Dyreng, Genola, Kjar, Poganeab, Shumway, and Woodrow soils. Abcal, Dyreng, Duggins, and Shumway soils average more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Duggins, Woodrow and Genola soils lack mottles within depth of 100 cm. Kjar soils have histic epipedons, and more than 40 percent carbonates in the particle-size control section. Poganeab soils have mottles at depths of less than 50 cm. Shumway soils also have a cambic horizon and have more than 40 percent carbonates in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; low runoff; moderately slow or slow permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. A seasonal high water is at depths of 76 to 100 cm during June to August in normal years. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for irrigated crops of alfalfa, small grains, corn, sugar beets and improved pasture. Principal native vegetation is greasewood, saltgrass and rabbitbrush.  These soils are correlated to semi-desert ecological sites in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Utah; MLRA 28A. The series is moderately extensive in the Sanpete and Delta Soil Survey Areas.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Millard County (Delta Soil Survey Area), Utah, 1970.

REMARKS:  
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: The zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 18 cm. (Ap1 and part of the Ap2 horizons)
Aquic feature: Redox depletions and aquic conditions for some time within 100 cm in depth.
Particle-size control section: The zone from 25 to 100 cm (C2,C3,C4 and part of the C1 and C5 horizons).

The active cation exchange activity class was added to the taxonomic classification in December 2002 based on soil property data. 

Revision April 2009 changes the classification from Aquic Xerofluvents to Aquic Torrifluvents to better fit the moisture class where mapped. 

This series has been used where the water table is below 100 cm in some map units. Unless drained, these areas are outside the taxonomic class and concept of the series and should be reviewed for possible correlation to other soils.
