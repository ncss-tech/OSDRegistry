AWITAVA SERIES

The Awitava series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in thin reworked eolian material over old alluvium derived from igneous rocks.  Awitava soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes range from 3 to 9 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, active, mesic Petronodic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Awitava extremely gravely very fine sandy loam, on a west facing, 5 percent slope in juniper woodland at an elevation of 6,350 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on Aug. 29, 2000, the soil was dry throughout. The surface is covered by 60 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles and 1 percent stones.

(14 to 50 inches thick)

    BCk--65 to 80 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4), extremely gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4), moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; carbonate concretions on bottom of rock fragments; 6 percent calcium carbonate; 65 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, and 1 percent stones; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.   

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: Thin reworked eolian material over alluvium derived from igneous rocks
Landform:  Fan remnant
Slopes:  3 to 9 percent
Elevation:  5,400 to 6,500 feet
Mean annual temperature: 50 to 52 degrees F.

Precipitation pattern: Uniform with slight dip in May and June and slight increase in July and August.
Frost-free period: 120 to 135 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Zyme series.  The Zyme soils are shallow and are on sideslopes of fan remnants. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, medium runoff, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These areas are used for grazing.  The area is an open Utah juniper forest with an understory of galleta, Wyoming big sage, and alkali sacaton.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Areas surrounding Sleeping Ute Mountain, Montezuma County, Colorado; MLRA 36; small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Montezuma County, Colorado, Ute Mountain soil survey area, parts of Colorado and New Mexico.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: The zone from 0 to 4 inches.  (A1, A2 horizons)
Calcic horizon: The zone from 4 to 80 inches.  (Bk1, Bk2, Bk3, and BCk horizons)
Series control section: The zone from 0 to 79 inches.
Particle-size control section: The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (Bk1, and part of the Bk2 horizons)

The Bk2 horizon has 85 percent cemented material with troweled and laminar surfaces.  The material is not continuous enough to qualify as a petrocalcic horizon.  

Surface layers are influenced by eolian material. 

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
