AUCHARD SERIES

The Auchard series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from semiconsolidated shale, siltstone, and mudstone.  These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Natrustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Auchard loam, rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    E--0 to 3 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate very thin platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; many light gray (10YR 7/2) silt and sand skeletans on faces of plates; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick)

    Btn--3 to 9 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; strong medium columnar structure; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; continuous distinct clay films on faces of peds; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist, continuous clay films on faces of peds; silt and sand skeletans on tops of columns; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 9 inches thick)

    Btkn--9 to 24 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silty clay, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; few fine seams and masses of lime; continuous faint coatings of lime on faces of peds; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual smooth boundary. (5 to 15 inches thick)

    Bkyz--24 to 33 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silty clay, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium angular blocky structure; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; common fine seams and masses of gypsum and other salts; disseminated lime; few fine masses of lime; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual smooth boundary. (8 to 15 inches thick)

    Cr--33 to 60 inches; gray (5Y 6/1) semiconsolidated shale that crushes to a silty clay, gray (5Y 5/1) moist; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).
