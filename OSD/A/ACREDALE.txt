MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  City of Virginia Beach, Virginia, 1979.  The name is from a small community.

REMARKS:  Acredale soils have been included with Bladen and Roanoke soils in past mapping.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University soil survey lab data shows the typical pedon of the Acredale series to have a base saturation of 74.67 percent at 50 inches below the top of the argillic.  The particle-size control section has 26 percent clay, 55 percent silt, and 9 percent sand that is coarser than very fine sand as a weighted average, with 76 percent quartz and 20 percent weatherable minerals, mainly feldspar and mica, in the 20 to 2,000 micron fraction.

Sample Numbers:  S77VA76-49-(1-6), S73VA76-3-(1-7), S75VA76-23-(1-6), S75VA-76-20-(1-5), S77VA-76-66-(1-7), S75-VA-76-29-(1-6), S78VA-76-62-(1-5), S73VA-76-1-(1-7).
