ARMITAGE SERIES

The Armitage series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium underlain by sand and gravel at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  These soils are on fans and terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Natrustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Armitage cobbly loam, native grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(3 to 5 inches thick)

    2C--36 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 55 percent pebbles, 10 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).
