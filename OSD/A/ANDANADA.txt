ANDANADA SERIES

The Andanada series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from basalt.  Andanada soils are on shoulders of mesas and undulating plateaus.  Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Lithic Ustic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Andanada very gravelly loam, on the shoulder of a mesa sloping 11 percent to the southeast at 6,218 feet elevation--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on October 16, 2000, the profile was dry throughout.)  Surface is covered with 35 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 1 percent stones.

    Ak--0 to 3 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) very gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and many very fine roots; 30 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, and 1 percent stones; violently effervescent, secondary calcium carbonate segregated as few fine irregularly shaped coats on faces of peds and on rock fragments (26 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick)

    Bk--3 to 9 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few medium, few fine, and common very fine roots; 30 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; violently effervescent, secondary calcium carbonate segregated as few fine irregularly shaped coats on faces of peds and on rock fragments (29 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (2 to 7 inches thick)

    2R--9 inches; indurated basalt bedrock

TYPE LOCATION: Santa Fe County, about 4 miles east-northeast of White Rock; Latitude 35 degrees 50 minutes 49 seconds North and Longitude 106 degrees 08 minutes 17 seconds West, NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture: - The soil moisture control section is intermittently moist in some part from July to October and December to March. The soils are driest in May and June. The soil moisture regime is torric (aridic) bordering on ustic.

Average annual soil temperature: 52 to 54 degrees F.
Depth to lithic contact: 4 to 10 inches
Lithology of rock fragments: Basalt

Particle-size control section weighted averages:
Silicate clay content: 18 to 27 percent
Sand content: 40 to 65 percent
Fine sand or coarser content: 35 to 55 percent
Rock fragment content: 35 to 60 percent 

Ak horizons
Value: 3 to 6 dry; 2 to 4 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3 dry, 2 to 4 moist
Clay content: 14 to 24 percent
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 15 to 30 percent 
Salinity, mmhos/cm: 0 to 2
Sodicity, SAR: 0 to 4
Rock fragments: total range is 35 to 50 percent, 30 to 40 percent gravel, 5 to 10 percent cobbles, 0 to 2 percent stones

Bk horizon
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 to 6 dry; 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3 dry, 2 to 4 moist
Texture: very gravelly loam, very gravelly sandy clay loam
Clay content: 20 to 27 percent
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 20 to 40 percent 
Salinity, mmhos/cm: 0 to 2
Sodicity, SAR: 0 to 4
Rock fragments: total range is 35 to 60 percent, 30 to 50 percent gravel, 5 to 10 percent cobbles
Other features: These horizons represent degrading calcic horizons but do not meet definition criteria 3b. for a calcic horizon and/or are too thin. 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Daklos, Ednagrey, Hillburn, Meriwhitica, Nonip, Redsun, Reef, Skos, Sunup, Teesto and Windcomb series.  These series all have less than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  In addition, Daklos, Hillburn, Nonip, Reef, Skos, and Windcomb soils do not have visible secondary calcium carbonates.  Meriwhitica, Reef, and Windcomb soils have less than 18 percent clay.  The Ednagrey series has rock fragments of limestone. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Andanada soils are on shoulders of mesas and undulating plateaus. They formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived locally from early Quaternary age Cuerbio Basalt formation. Slopes are 5 to 15 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,800 to 6,700 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Churipa, Ildefonso, and Parida soils. Churipa soils are loamy, have argillic horizons, and occur on beveled summits.  Ildefonso soils have calcic horizons, are very deep, and occur on backslopes.  Parida soils are coarse-loamy, are very deep, and occur on footslopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low to medium surface runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Andanada soils are used for livestock grazing, recreation, and wildlife habitat.  The historic climax vegetation is New Mexico feathergrass, blue grama, black grama, sideoats grama, and oneseed juniper.  The ecological site is Hills (R036XB124NM).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Andanada soils are of moderate extent on the southwestern Espanola Basin part of the Basin and Range province in northcentral New Mexico.  The MLRA is 36.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Santa Fe County, New Mexico; Santa Fe Soil Survey Update, 2008.  Andanada is a coined name. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 3 inches. (Ak horizon)
Lithic contact - The presence of indurated basalt bedrock at 9 inches. (2R layer)

Despite the dark colors, a mollic epipedon is not recognized in this soil because it is not moist in some part for greater than 90 days.  A calcic horizon is not recognized because this soil typically has less than 5 percent identifiable secondary carbonates and/or the horizon is less than 15cm thick.

Taxonomic version: Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.
