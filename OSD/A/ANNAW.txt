ANNAW SERIES

The Annaw series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Annaw soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, and fan skirts.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Sandy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Typic Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Annaw very gravelly loamy sand--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered with approximately 40 percent surface gravel and 1 to 2 percent cobbles.

    3Btb--112 to 135 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly sandy clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine and few fine tubular pores; faint patches of carbonate on lower surface of peds; 15 percent gravel; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 25 cm thick)

    3Bkb--135 to 160 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) finely stratified extremely gravelly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine and common fine interstitial pores; few faint clay films lining pores; many medium carbonate coats on rock fragments; 65 percent gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3).

TYPE LOCATION:  Nye County, Nevada; about one-fourth mile west of State Highway 361 along the Nye-Mineral county line; in the northeast quarter of section 1, T. 10 N., R. 35 E.; USGS Mount Annie SE 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 46 minutes 1.7 seconds N and longitude 118 degrees 1 minutes 18.4 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.7681667 latitude, -118.0238889 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry; moist in some part for short periods winter and early spring months, and for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October following convection storms; typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 16 degrees C.
Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.
Effervescence: Calcareous in all parts, ranges from slightly effervescent to violently effervescent.
Other features: Buried B horizon below 100 cm is absent in most pedons.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 2 to 6 percent.
Rock fragments: Averages 35 to 60 percent, mostly gravel.

A horizon
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.

Bw horizon
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4.
Texture: Sandy loam, fine sandy loam.
Rock fragments:  10 to 40 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles.
Clay films:  Few thin films in pores at the top of the horizon in some pedons.

Bk horizon
Value:  5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4.
Texture: Sandy loam or loamy sand.
Structure:  Massive or subangular blocky.

2C and 3Bk horizons
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4.
Texture:  Loamy sand, sand, loamy fine sand, loamy coarse sand. Some pedons have thin strata of sandy loam.
Structure:  Massive or weak subangular blocky.
Rock fragments:  35 to 65 percent gravel, 0 to 15 percent cobbles.
Consistence:  Soft or slightly hard, dry, nonsticky or slightly sticky and nonplastic or slightly plastic, wet.
Other features:  Horizons are stratified.  Strata of gravelly material are included in some pedons. Carbonate occurs as pendants on gravel and is disseminated in most pedons.  Carbonate coated gravelare in some horizons in some pedons.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Labkey, Lyx, Pumper, and Toulon series.

Labkey soils have noneffervescent matrix, lime occurs only on undersides of gravel. Lyx soils are not calcareous in the A and Bw horizons. Pumper and Toulon soils are not moist for 10 to 20 days in the summer. Also, Pumper soils have noncalcareous A and Bw horizons and the B horizon is loam, silt loam or very fine sandy loam and Toulon soils have relict oxide redox concentrations in the B and C horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Annaw soils are on alluvial fans, alluvial fan piedmonts, and fan skirts. These soils formed in mixed alluvium from rhyolite, andesite and other igneous and sedimentary rocks. Elevations are 1,220 to 2,044 meters.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 11 to 14 degrees C, and the frost-free season ranges from 130 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Goldyke, Izo and Wardenot soils.  Izo and Wardenot soils lack a cambic horizon. Goldyke soils are shallow to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Annaw soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Present vegetation is mainly galleta, Bailey's greasewood, Indian ricegrass, spiny menodora, winterfat, spiny hopsage, and shadscale.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  West-central Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  The series concept and main acreage is in MLRA 27, while other acreage occurs in MLRA 29.
