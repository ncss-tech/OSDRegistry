ANDER SERIES

The Ander series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, soils that formed in residuum weathered from sandstone in the Goliad Formation.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on footslopes of low hills on an inland dissected coastal plain.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 21.1 degrees C (70 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 864 mm (34 in).

Weesatche soils: are on similar landforms

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Permeability is slow.  Runoff is medium on slopes less than 1 percent slopes and high on 1 to 3 percent slope.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mostly for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Native grasses include little bluestem, feathery bluestem, Nash and hooded windmillgrass, and Texas and plains bristlegrass.  Woody species consist of live oak, post oak, mesquite, huisache, spiny hackberry, and pricklypear.  Coastal bermudagrass is the dominant improved pasture grass.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Goliad County, Texas, 2009. The name comes from a town in northern Goliad County.

REMARKS:  These soils were formerly included with the Papalote series.  The Papalote series has an ochric epipedon.  The redoximorphic features are considered relict and do not reflect present day moisture conditions.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle size control section: 30 to 80 cm (11.8 to 31.5 in) (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons) 
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 42 cm (0 to 16.5 in) (A1, A2, and Bt1 horizons) 
Argillic horizon: 30 to 183 cm (11.8 to 72 in) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and Btk horizons)
Pale feature: abrupt texture change from the A to Bt horizons.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization data from the series type location by the National Soil Survey Laboratory on sample (S07TX-175-002).
