ANACONDA SERIES

The Anaconda series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Anaconda loam, in cropland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 8 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; platy structure parting to moderate fine granular; loose; very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and coarse roots; 10 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 9 inches thick)

    Bw--8 to 14 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and coarse roots; many fine irregular pores; 10 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick)

    Bk1--14 to 27 inches; white (10YR 8/2) gravelly loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; massive; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; many fine irregular pores; continuous distinct fine coatings and casts on surface of pebbles; common fine masses of lime; violently effervescent; 15 percent pebbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 17 inches thick)

    Bk2--27 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) sandy loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; massive; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 10 percent pebbles; continuous distinct lime casts and coatings on surface of pebbles; common fine masses of lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations records:  MT0736, MT1053, MT7039, MT7040.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 8 inches, mixed (Ap horizon); a cambic horizon from 8 to 14 inches (Bw horizon); a calcic horizon from 14 to 60 inches (Bk1, Bk2 horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bw, Bk1, part of Bk3 horizon).  Anaconda soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.
