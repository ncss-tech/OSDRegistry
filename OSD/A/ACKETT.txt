ACKETT SERIES

The Ackett series consists of soils that are well drained and shallow to a duripan, that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from welded tuff.  They are on stream terraces, fan piedmont remnants, partial ballenas, and lower hillsides.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the average annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, mesic, shallow Xeric Argidurids

COMPETING SERIES:  These are Reina and Trosi series.  

Reina and Trosi soils lack a calcic horizon above the pan.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ackett soils are on stream terraces, fan piedmont remnants, partial ballenas, and lower hillsides.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from welded tuff and rhyolite with a component of volcanic ash.  Elevations are 1,495 to 2,045 meters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 200 to 300 mm.  The average annual temperature is 8 to 9 degrees C.  The frost free season is 90 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chuska, Elhina, Isknat, and Udaho soils.  Chuska soils are moderately fine textured.  Chuska and Elhina soils are on higher terraces.  Isknat soils are very deep and are on alluvial fans.  Udaho soils occur on sideslopes and dipslopes, have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section, and are moderately deep to welded ash.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Ackett soils are used for rangeland.  The native vegetation is black sagebrush, longleaf phlox, bluebunch wheatgrass, Thurber needlegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Ackett soils are of moderate extent in south central Idaho and northeastern Nevada. MLRA 25
