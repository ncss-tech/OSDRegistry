ARCTANDER SERIES 

The Arctander series consists of very deep, poorly drained and somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loamy colluvium from glacial drift and underlying calcareous till. These soils are on nearly level or concave slopes on lower footslopes and toeslopes of head and side slopes on till plains and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 735 millimeters.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota; MLRA SSO 10-5 (Albert Lea, Minnesota). 

SERIES PROPOSED: Kandiyohi County Minnesota, 2008. Source of name is a township in Kandiyohi County.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 0 to 85 centimeters (Ap, Al and A2 horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 85 to 109 centimeters (Bg horizon);
calcic horizon--the zone from a depth of 109 to 142 centimeters (2Bkg horizon);
aquic moisture regime.

A somewhat poorly drained overwash phase is recognized that has 20 to 50 centimeters of colluvium overlying the original dark-colored surface layer.

This series replaces the Delft soils that were previously correlated in parts of the Granite Falls Till geomorphic landform.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
