ALFLACK SERIES

The Alflack series consists of well drained soils which are moderately deep to noncalcareous, fractured sandstone.  They formed in sandstone residuum on mountain hillsides.  Slopes range from 4 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 cm, and the mean annual temperature is about 1.1 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed Typic Cryorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Alflack loamy fine sand--woodland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

      Oi--0 to 3 cm; slightly decomposed pine needles and other forest litter.

      A--3 to 8 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loamy fine sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine, medium, and coarse roots; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 13 cm thick)

      C--8 to 59 cm; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) very channery loamy fine sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common medium and fine roots; 35 percent sandstone channers, 10 percent sandstone flagstones; slightly acid (pH 6.2). (43 to 94 cm thick)

      R--59 cm; fractured, noncalcareous sandstone which can be broken and removed with a spade; fragments do not slake.

TYPE LOCATION:  Natrona County, Wyoming; on the top of Casper Mountain; about 150 meters east and 120 meters north of the SW corner of sec. 14, T. 32 N., R. 79 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to fractured sandstone bedrock ranges from 50 to 100 cm.  Reactions are medium acid to neutral.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 0 to 3 degrees C., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 6 to 8 degrees C.  Rock fragments are mainly sandstone channers and flagstones.

The A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 30 percent.

The C horizon has value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  The matrix texture is loamy fine sand or loamy sand.  Rock fragments range from 40 to 60 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chena, Comad, Gryalock, Mirror Lake, Obscurity, Ovando, Polepatch, Stecum, and Studebaker series.  All of these soils, except Stecum, are deep.  Also, Comad soils have an E and Bt horizons; Obscurity and Studebaker soils contain 15 to 50 percent volcanic ash; and Ovando soils have lamellae.  Stecum soils formed in material weathered from granite and gneiss and contain over 50 percent coarse sand.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Alflack soils are on mountain hillsides.  They formed in residuum derived dominantly from noncalcareous sandstone.  Slopes range from 4 to 25 percent.  Elevation is 2,195 to 2,550 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 635 to 890 mm, and the mean annual temperature is 0 to 2 degrees C.  The frost-free season is less than 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Foxton and Starley soils.  Foxton soils have an argillic horizon and are fine. Starley soils are loamy-skeletal and shallow.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; runoff is slow or medium; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for wood products, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  Native vegetation is mainly lodgepole pine with a sparse understory of grasses and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mountains of Central Wyoming.  The series is of small extent.
