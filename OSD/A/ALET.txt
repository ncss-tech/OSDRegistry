ALET SERIES

The Alet series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvial sediments derived predominantly from material weathered from sandstone. These nearly level to very gently sloping, occasionally flooded soils are on drainageways. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 22.2 degrees C (72 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 610 mm (24 in).

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage class: Well.
Permeability: moderate. 
Runoff: negligible. 
Flooding:  soils are occasionally flooded when they receive runoff water from tropical storms once in 20 years of low velocity and short duration.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Native woody vegetation includes mesquite, sugar hackberry, spiny hackberry huisache, prickly pear, and whitebrush.  Grass species include fourflower trichloris, Arizona cottontop, sideoats grama, plains bristlegrass, hooded windmillgrass, and prairie threeawn.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Duval County, Texas, 1998.  The name is a coined derivation of the Tela series.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle size control section: 18 to 69 cm (7 to 27 in).  (Bt1 and upper Bt2 horizon) 
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 38 cm (0 to 15 in).  (A and Bt1 horizons)
Argillic horizon: 18 to 203 (7 to 80 in).  (Bt and Btk horizons)
Secondary carbonates: 117 to 203 cm (46 to 80 in). (Btk horizons)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from Jim Wells and Live Oak Counties, Texas.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Local lab data available on pedons from McMullen County.
