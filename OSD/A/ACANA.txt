Mickey soils have particle-size control sections with 27 to 35 percent clay and are noncalcareous throughout the argillic horizon. Muni soils have a 25 to 60 cm thick duripan, 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section, and average less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Zadvar soils have mean annual soil temperatures ranging from 11 to 15 degrees C., and 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Acana soils are on the shoulders and backslopes of fan remnants and pediment remnants. These soils formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and mixed lacustrine deposits. Elevations range from 1,500 to 1,800 meters. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. The climate is cool, semiarid, with a mean annual precipitation of 200 to 300 mm. The mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C, and the mean annual soil temperature is 8 to 12 degrees C. The frost free period is 100 to 130 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are competing Minu series, and the Linco and Armespan soils.  Armespan soils do not have argillic horizons above the duripan. Linco soils do not have duripans.  

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.
