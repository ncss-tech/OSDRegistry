ARBOR SERIES

The Arbor series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in 45 to 75 centimeters of loamy local alluvium and in the underlying firm glacial till.  These soils are on slightly concave to linear foot slopes adjacent to dissected uplands.  Slope ranges from 5 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 890 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Adair County, Iowa, 1958.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 46 centimeters (Ap, A1, and A2 horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 46 to 152 centimeters (BA, 2Bt1, 2Bt2, and 2BC horizons);
udic moisture regime.

The Arbor soils were formerly classified as Argiudolls based on the difference in texture of materials 1 and 2 and the presence of a few clay films.

Cation-exchange class is inferred from lab data for similar soils in the surrounding area.
