DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:

USE AND VEGETATION:  Antelopeflat soils are used mainly for dry land crops.  Wheat, millet, and sorghum are the principal crops.    

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Antelopeflat soils occur in northeastern Colorado.  The series is moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Denver, Colorado

SERIES PROPOSED:  Morgan County, Colorado, 2004.  The name Antelopeflat is from Antelope Flat Draw on the Hoyt, Colorado USGS Quad.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 25 to 100 centimeters (10 to 40 inches) (Bw, Bss, Bssky horizons)
Vertic features: The presence of slickensides at 31 to 104 centimeters (12 to 41 inches) (Bss, Bssky horizons)

The parent material is a fine alluvium laid over loamy alluvial sediments.  The fine alluvium can range from 30 to 80 inches in thickness.

Because of the varying thickness of the fine alluvium, the control section may be fine-loamy in some pedons.

This series is being established in an area where land leveling is prevalent.
