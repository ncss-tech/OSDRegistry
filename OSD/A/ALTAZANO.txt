ALTAZANO SERIES

The Altazano series consists of very deep, well to somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium and slope alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist, and from granitic sandstone, fanglomerate, and mudstone. Altazano soils are on inset fans of eroded fan remnants and narrow flood plains of valley floors. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Pietown and Sodawells series.  The Pietown series are very deep.  The Sodawells series receive most of their moisture during April through June.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Altazano soils are on small inset fans of erosional fan remnants and narrow flood plains of valley floors. They formed in alluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist; and from Tertiary granitic sandstone, fanglomerate, and mudstone. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,700 to 7,900 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 15 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Buckhorse, Levante, and Dondiego soils. Buckhorse soils have mollic epipedons and argillic horizons, and occur on adjacent toeslopes.  Levante soils are sandy, do not have buried soils within 40 inches, and occur on adjacent narrowflood plains of arroyos.  Dondiego soils are fine-loamy, have thick mollic epipedons, and occur on adjacent low stream terraces.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained, low and very low surface runoff; permeability is moderately rapid to moderate in the upper loamy horizons and rapid to very rapid in the lower sandy horizons. These soils are subject to occasional or frequent, extremely brief periods of flooding between July and September. Floodwaters may have high velocity but are generally less than 2 feet deep.

USE AND VEGETATION: Altazano soils are used for urban development, livestock grazing, and recreation. The historic climax vegetation is blue grama, black grama, Gambel oak, and oneseed juniper.  The ecological site is Hills (R036XB124NM). 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Altazano soils are of small extent on the southeastern Espanola Basin part of the Basin and Range province in northcentral New Mexico. The MLRA is 36.
