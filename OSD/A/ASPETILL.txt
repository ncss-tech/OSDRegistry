COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Angelwhine, Badwater, Bickmore, Bluebell, Booneville, Buena Vista, Dab, Delhew, Hawkinspeak, Keman, Littlemud (T), Lostcannon, Monibasin, Parkalley (T), Parkay, Redbird, Rutherford, Sweetmount, and Woodhurst series.

Angelwhine soils have mean summer soil temperature of 52 to 59 degrees F. and have mollic epipedons that are 16 to 24 inches thick.  Badwater soils have 25 to 35 percent clay and are dominated by boulders in the particle-size control section.  Bickmore, Bluebell, Buena Vista, Hawkinspeak, Littlemud, Rutherford, and Woodhurst soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Booneville soils average 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and have mean annual soil temperature of 36 to 40 degrees F.  Dab soils have mollic epipedons that are 16 to 24 inches thick.  Delhew soils have less than 18 percent clay and are dominated by fine gravel (2 to 5 mm diameter) in the particle-size control section.  Keman soils are dominated by gravel in the particle-size control section and have mean summer soil temperature of 55 to 58 degrees F.  Lostcannon soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Monibasin soils have mean summer soil temperature of 52 to 59 degrees F. and are dominated by stones in the particle-size control section.  Parkalley soils have the base of the argillic horizon between 28 and 35 inches from the soil surface, average 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section, and are dominated by flagstones.  Parkay soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have mean summer soil temperature of 52 to 58 degrees F.  Redbird soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates within 40 inches of the soil surface.  Sweetmount soils are deep to paralithic contacts and have subhorizons of the argillic horizon with 27 to 50 percent clay.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Aspetill soils are on moraines.  They typically occur on footslope positions.  They formed in till derived from igneous and metamorphic rocks such as granodiorite, andesite, schist, and gneiss.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 7,000 to 9,200 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 45 inches, the mean annual temperature is 36 to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 30 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cloudburst, Dunderberg, and Murain soils.  Cloudburst soils have umbric epipedons and a frigid temperature regime.  Dunderberg soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are influenced by volcanic ash.  Murain soils have a frigid temperature regime.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium surface runoff; moderate permeability (moderately high or high saturated hydraulic conductivity).  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 2.0 and 3.3 feet (moderately deep or deep free water occurrence classes) during spring months in some years.  Cumulative annual duration class is Transitory.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Aspetill soils are used for forest land, recreation, watershed, and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is mainly a forest canopy of quaking aspen with an understory of slender wheatgrass, mountain brome, mountain big sagebrush, and snowberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern California, on the east side of the Sierra Nevada Range.  These soils are not extensive with about 3,400 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 22A.
