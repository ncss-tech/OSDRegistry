ASHBOUGH SERIES 

The Ashbough series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on flood plains and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Torrifluventic Haplustepts 

TYPICAL PEDON: Ashbough silt loam, in pasture (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 4 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine and few fine pores; disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Cg2--51 to 61 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) sandy loam, including thin strata of silt loam and loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; common fine distinct light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist redox concentrations; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of Cg horizons is 10 to 20 inches)

    2C--61 to 84 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) extremely gravelly sand, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 70 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0)
