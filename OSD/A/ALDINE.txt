GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Atasco (TX), Bevil (TX), Bissonnet (TX), and Vamont (TX) soils. 
Atasco soils: are in a fine family; on interfluves
Bevil and Vamont soils: are clayey throughout; on flats
Bissonnet soils: are poorly drained; on flats

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; medium runoff.  Permeability is very slow. These soils have episaturation in the E and Bt/E horizons from winter to late spring.  Endosaturation occurs in the Btg horizon during late winter to late spring.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are in pine and hardwood trees and used mainly for woodland, grazing.  Principal vegetation consists of loblolly pine, red oak, water oak, sweetgum, hawthorn, America beautyberry, yaupon, greenbrier, switchgrass, beaked panicum, pinehill bluestem, Indiangrass, and sedges.  A few areas have been cleared and used for improved pastures and cultivated crops.  The main crops are rice, soybeans, corn and grain sorghum.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeast Texas; MLRA 152B; LRR T; the series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Harris County, Texas; 1973.

REMARKS:  The Aldine soils were formerly included with the Acadia and Texla series.  Map units that included the Aldine series ranged from pimple mounds to interfluve landforms.  During the update of MLRA 152B, the Aldine soils were restricted to pimple mounds.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in)

Glossic horizon: 25 to 48 cm (10 to 19 in)

Argillic horizon: 25 to 203 cm (10 to 80 in)

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Soil survey office lab data is availbale from the type location.  Kellogg Soil Survey Lab data available on pedon S12TX1993304 (lab pedon number is 12N8313).
