COMPETING SERIES:
There are no competing series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent Material--Loamy estuarine deposits over herbaceous organic material 
Landscape--Coastal estuaries, coastal lowlands, and tidal rivers
Landform--Salt-water or brackish tidal marshes, in estuaries on the landward side of barrier-island lagoons and along tidally influenced rivers and bays
Elevation--0 to 1 meter
Mean Annual Air Temperature--13 to 15 degrees C (55 to 59 degrees F)
Mean Annual Precipitation--965 to 1219 millimeters (38 to 48 inches)
Frost Free Period: 175 to 200 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Boxiron, Broadkill, Mannington, Mispillion, and Transquaking soils.
Boxiron soils--have a histic epipedon and are on similar landforms 
Broadkill soils--do not have a histic epipedon and also do not have buried organic soil materials but do occur on similar landforms
Mannington soils--do not have sulfidic materials and occur in fresh water marshes
Mispillion soils--have organic layers 40 to less than 130 centimeters thick underlain by loamy mineral materials, on similar landforms
Transquaking soils--organic soils with organic layers 130 centimeters or more thick, underlain by loamy mineral layers, on similar landforms

DRAINAGE AND SATURADED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage Class--Very poorly drained
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity--Moderately high in mineral horizons and moderately high or high in the organic horizons
Soil moisture regime--Peraquic
Flooding--Very frequent, very brief (flooded by salt or brackish tidal waters twice daily and during significant coastal storm events)

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major uses--Appoquinimink soils are mainly used as wetland wildlife or as shellfish and small crustacean habitat. Large areas of these soils have been ditched to provide better drainage for mosquito control but have led to marsh degradation and erosion in some areas.
Natural Vegetation--Salt-tolerant wetland herbaceous species, predominantly salt marsh cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora), salt hay (Spartina patens), salt wort (Salicornia sp.), and spike grass (Distichlis spicata).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
General area-- Tidal marshes along the landward side of barrier island lagoons and along tidally influenced rivers and bays in Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey
Land Resource Regions--S - Northern Atlantic Slope Diversified Farming Region, T - Atlantic and Gulf Coast Lowland Forest and Crop Region
MLRA(s)--149A, 153C, 153D
Extent--Moderate extent

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Cape May County, New Jersey, 1997.

REMARKS: Appoquinimink soils were formerly mapped as tidal marsh miscellaneous areas. These soils become extremely acid when drained or removed from the marsh.

Carbon stock and carbon density ranges are not primary criteria for defining this series.

Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include--
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 15 centimeters (Aseg horizon)
Aquic conditions--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 200 centimeters is continuously saturated (endosaturation)
High n-value--the zone from the surface to 81 centimeters (Aseg, Cseg1, and Cseg2 horizons) is moderately fluid to highly fluid.
Sulfidic materials--incubated samples, to a depth of 200 centimeters, show a drop in pH of 0.5 or more units to a pH value of 4.0 or less within 8 weeks
Sapric soil materials--the zone from 81 to 109 centimeters (Oase horizon) has a fiber content after rubbing that is less than one-sixth of the soil volume
Hemic soil materials--the zone from 109 to 200 centimeters (Oese horizon) has a fiber content after rubbing that is one-sixth to two-fifths of the soil volume
