(Combined thickness of the Cg horizon is 4 to 36 inches.)

     Oa--32 to 43 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) muck, sapric soil material; fiber content is one-tenth of the soil volume after rubbing; 25 percent by weight mineral soil material; few fine roots; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.

     Oe--43 to 80 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) mucky peat, hemic soil material; fiber content is one-third of the soil volume after rubbing; 30 percent by weight mineral soil material; slightly acid. (Combined thickness of the O horizon is more than 16 inches.)

TYPE LOCATION: New Castle County, Delaware; east of Odessa, about 1.1 miles west and 1150 feet north of the intersection of county roads 424 and 439, about 400 feet into the marsh northeast of the bank of the Appoquinimink River;  lat. 39 degrees 27 minutes 12 seconds N. and long. 75 degrees 36 minutes 47 seconds W.

Texture--mucky silt loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam
Organic Matter Content--5 to 15 percent

Cg horizon:

Texture--silt loam, silty clay loam, or mucky silt loam
Organic Matter Content: 1 to 10 percent, some pedons contain thin lenses of organic soil material less than 8 inches thick

O horizon:
Color--hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5 chroma of 1 to 4, or is neutral with value of 2 to 5
Texture--muck or mucky peat (sapric or hemic soil materials), fiber content after rubbing ranges from 5 to 50 percent of the soil volume
Mineral Material Content: 10 to 70 percent by weight, lenses of silt, silt loam, or very fine sand range from none to common throughout the organic layers

C'g horizon (if it occurs):
Color--hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 2 to 6, chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 2 to 6
Texture-silt loam, mucky silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam
Organic Matter Content: 1 to 10 percent, some pedons contain thin lenses of organic soil material less than 8 inches thick

COMPETING SERIES:
Broadkill soils--do not have organic layers more than 8 inches thick in the upper 72 inches, on similar landforms

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landscape: Coastal Plain
Landform: Salt-water tidal marshes in estuaries which are continuously saturated and flooded twice daily by tidal waters
Elevation: 0 to 2 feet
Parent Material: Loamy fluvial sediments, high in silt, overlying organic materials dominantly from herbaceous plants
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 55 to 58 degrees F.
Mean Annual Precipitation: 38 to 48 inches
Frost Free Period: 175 to 200 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Mispillion soils--organic soils with organic layers 16 to 51 inches thick, on similar landforms
Transquaking soils--organic soils and lack mineral layers greater than 16 inches thick within the upper 51 inches of the soil
Broadkill soils--do not have organic layers more than 8 inches thick in the upper 72 inches, on similar landforms
Mannington soils--do not have sulfidic materials, in fresh water influenced marshes

MAJOR USES: Used mainly as wetland wildlife or as shellfish and small crustacean habitat. Large areas of these soils in Delaware have been ditched to provide better drainage for mosquito control. 

VEGETATION: The natural vegetation is salt-tolerant wetland herbaceous species, predominantly salt marsh cordgrass, salt hay, salt wort, and spike grass.

DISTRIBUTION: Coastal and estuarine areas of Delaware, Maryland, and New Jersey

EXTENT: Moderate

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Cape May County, New Jersey, 1997.

REMARKS: Appoquinimink soils were formerly mapped as tidal marsh miscellaneous areas. These soils become extremely acid when drained or removed from the marsh.

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 6 inches (Ag horizon)
Aquic conditions--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 80 inches is continuously saturated (endosaturation)
High n value--the zone from the surface to 32 inches has n value greater than 0.7, typically greater than 1.0, material flows easily between the fingers when squeezed.
Sulfidic materials--incubated samples, to a depth of 80 inches, show a drop in pH of 0.5 or more units to a pH value of 4.0 or less within 8 weeks
Sapric soil materials--the zone from 32 to 43 inches has a fiber content after rubbing that is less than one-sixth of the soil volume
Hemic soil materials--the zone from 43 to 80 inches has a a fiber content after rubbing that is one-sixth to two-fifths of the soil volume
