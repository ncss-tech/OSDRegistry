ARLAND SERIES

The Arland series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of till underlain by sandstone bedrock. These soils are on knolls, ridge tops, and side slopes of glaciated bedrock-controlled uplands. Slope ranges from 1 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.
