AVALON SERIES

The Avalon series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly and moderately permeable soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from sandstone and shale.  These soils are on terraces, alluvial fans, dissected fans, and hills  and have slopes of 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 8 inches.

Siltcliffe soils have a lithologic discontinuity below 40 inches with very gravelly or extremely gravelly textures; and are formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits from limestone and basic igneous rocks.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Avalon soils are on broad rolling terraces, old alluvial fans, and hills.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in deep alluvium from sandstone and shale.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 6 to 11 inches.  Elevation ranges from 4,500 to 6,100 feet and the frost-free period is 90 to 190 days.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat and recreation.  Native vegetation consists of galleta, shadscale, Indian ricegrass, Gardener's saltbush, needleandthread, bottlebrush squirreltail, and fourwing saltbush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Colorado and central Utah.  LRR D, MLRA 34B.  The soils of this series are of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Duchesne County, Utah, 1947.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of approximately 2 inches.
Calcic horizon--the zone from approximately 10 to 30 inches.
The responsibility for the Avalon series was transferred from Utah to Colorado in 1994.  The former type location in Utah was reclassified to coarse-loamy.
The responsibility for the Avalon series was transferred from MO8 (Phoenix) to MO6 (Lakewood) in 1997.
Activity class was estimated based on lab data in the survey area.
