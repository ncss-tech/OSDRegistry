SERIES ESTABLISHED: Anne Arundel County, Maryland, 2003 

REMARKS: Annapolis soils were formerly mapped as Monmouth soils in Anne Arundel County, MD. Changes in the glauconitic mineralogy family resulted in a need to develop a glauconitic series to replace soils that are fine-loamy (Monmouth soils are in a fine particle-size family). Sulfidic materials are commonly found at some depth below the series control section. (The initial name proposed for this series was "Magothy.") 

Diagnostic horizons, characteristics and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 inches) (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 20 to 155 cm (8 to 61 inches) (Bt1,Bt2, E and Bt3 horizons) 
Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 155 cm
