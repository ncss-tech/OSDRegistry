AIRPORT SERIES

The Airport series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from limestone, sandstone, shale and quartzite.  Airport soils are on lake plains, lake terraces, and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Airport soils are on lake plains, lake terraces, and stream terraces.  These soils formed in calcareous lacustrine deposits derived from limestone, sandstone, shale, and quartzite.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 17 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is 66 to 72 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 120 to 175 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ford, Payson, Syracuse, and Warm Springs soils.  Ford soils are coarse-loamy and are moderately deep to a cemented horizon.  Payson soils are fine textured and have ochric epipedons.  Syracuse soils are coarse-loamy and do not have natric horizons.  Warm Springs soils are fine-loamy and do not have natric horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; medium surface runoff; slow permeability (moderately low or moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity).  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 2.0 and 3.0 feet (moderately deep free water occurrence class) between April and September.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Airport soils are used mostly used for pasture.  Some areas have been drained, reclaimed, and are used for irrigated cropland.  The native vegetation is dominantly inland saltgrass with some black greasewood and pickleweed.  In Utah this series is correlated with Alkali bottom range sites.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Utah and southern Idaho.  These soils are not extensive with about 7,300 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 28A.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Phoenix, Arizona.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Salt Lake Area, Utah, 1936.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 19 inches (A and Btkn horizons).

Natric horizon - The zone from 6 to 19 inches (Btkn horizon).

Calcic horizon - The zone from 6 to 40 inches (Btkn, Bk1, and Bk2 horizons).

Aquic conditions - The conditions of endosaturation, reduction, and redoximorphic features between 19 and 40 inches at certain times during normal years (parts of the Bk1 and Bk2 horizons).

Particle-size control section - The zone from 6 to 19 inches (Btkn horizon).


In August 1994 the classification was changed from Typic Natraquoll to Aquic Natrixerolls.  The 5Y hue and 2 chroma matrix in the 19 to 32 inch layer was interpreted to be redox depletions for placement in the Aquic subgroup.

The Davis-Weber soil survey area (UT607) includes a component that is a "shallow water table phase" and has ponding.
 
In the Box Elder County, Eastern Part soil survey area Airport is described as moderately well drained and the taxonomic unit classifies as a Typic Natrixeroll.  These soils will be correlated to the Fridlo series.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has partial characterization data by the Soils Laboratory from Utah State University (USU) Logan, UT and is published on pages 136-137, Table 11 of the Soil Survey of Davis-Weber Area, Utah.  The pH values in the typical pedon are from saturated paste.
