ABERSITO SERIES

The Abersito series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in colluvial and alluvial sediments derived from mixed sources.  Abersito soils are on hills and mesas.  Slope is 5 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, mixed, active, frigid Typic Paleustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Abersito very cobbly sandy clay loam--woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

   Oi--0 to 2 inches; Pine needles and oak leaves.

   A--2 to 5 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) very cobbly sandy clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; common fine and very fine irregular pores; 40 percent cobbles, 10 percent pebbles and 5 percent stones; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)

   E--5 to 11 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very cobbly fine sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 30 percent cobbles and 10 percent pebbles; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

   Bt--11 to 26 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) very cobbly clay; yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; strong medium angular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; few very fine tubular pores; many thick clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 35 percent cobbles and 5 percent pebbles; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (14 to 24 inches thick)

   2R--26 inches; sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION:  Cibola County, New Mexico; about one-half mile southwest of Lookout Mountain; 1,100 feet east and 2,300 feet south of the northwest corner of sec. 2, T. 11 N., R. 14 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Depth to bedrock: 20 to 40 inches

Rock fragments in the particle-size control section: 35 to 60 percent by volume with 30 to 40 percent cobbles, 0 to 5 percent stones and 5 to 15 percent pebbles.

Soil moisture: Intermittently moist in the soil moisture control section in some part during July-September and December-March. Driest during May and June. Typic ustic moisture regime

A horizon
Value:  4 or 5 dry
Chroma:  2 or 3

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Abersito soils are on hills and mesas.  Slopes are 5 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 8,300 to 8,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 24 inches and the mean annual temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 85 to 105 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cinnadale, Mirabal and Moreno soils.  Cinnadale and Mirabal soils lack argillic horizons.  Moreno soils are deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; rapid runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for wood products, livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Present native vegetation is ponderosa pine, Gambel oak and Arizona fescue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The series is of small extent in west central New Mexico. MLRA is 39.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of about 11 inches.  (A and E horizons)

Argillic horizon - The zone from 11 inches to a depth of 26 inches.  (Bt horizon)

Lithic contact - Sandstone occurs at about 26 inches.
