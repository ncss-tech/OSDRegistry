ANAMAC SERIES 

The Anamac series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone, argillite or fine grained igneous rocks. These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces or hills.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Haplustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Anamac loam, in cropland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Ap--0 to 4 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse platy structure parting to strong fine and medium granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, few fine and few coarse roots; many very fine and fine, and few medium pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (4 to 9 inches thick)

    Bw--4 to 12 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure parting to strong fine and medium granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, few fine and few coarse roots; many very fine, common fine and fine medium tubular and interstitial pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 15 inches thick)

    Bk1--12 to 18 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium and coarse prismatic structure parting to strong medium and coarse subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, few fine and few coarse roots; many very fine, common fine and few medium tubular and interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel; disseminated lime, few fine masses of calcium carbonate, distinct calcium carbonate coatings on undersides of fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.

    Bk2--18 to 31 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium and fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few common roots; many very fine and common fine tubular and interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel; disseminated calcium carbonate, few fine masses of calcium carbonate, distinct lime coatings on undersides of fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of Bk horizons is 19 to 43 inches.)

    BC--31 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few coarse roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).
