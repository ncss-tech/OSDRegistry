ALBORN SERIES

The Alborn series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in loamy glaciolacustrine deposits. These soils are on flats on glacial lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 670 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Alborn silt loam, on a flat of 1 percent slope in a cultivated field, on a glacial lake plain, at an elevation of about 387 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

    Ap--0 to 20 centimeters; black (10YR 2/1) silt loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine and medium roots; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (18 to 24 centimeters thick)

    Bg1--20 to 58 centimeters; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silt loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine and medium roots; few fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. 

    Bg2--58 to 84 centimeters; light olive gray (5Y 6/2) silt loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine and medium roots; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bg horizon ranges 51 to 76 centimeters)

    Bkg--84 to 137 centimeters; light olive gray (5Y 6/2) silt loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary. (33 to 76 centimeters thick)

    Cg--137 to 203 centimeters; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) silt loam; massive; friable; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) 88-Northern Minnesota Glacial Lake Basins; St. Louis County, Minnesota, Meadowlands subset; about 5 miles northwest of Meadowlands; 1283 feet west and 140 feet north of the southeast corner of sec. 11, T. 53 N., R. 20 W; USGS Elmer, Minnesota topographic quadrangle; latitude 47 degrees 5 minutes 1 second N., and longitude 92 degrees 49 minutes 57 seconds W., NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Mollic epipedon thickness--18 to 24 centimeters
Depth to carbonates--76 to 107 centimeters
These soils do not have rock fragments

Ap or A horizon:
Hue-10YR
Value-2 or 3, 3 to 5 dry
Chroma-1 or 2, 1 or 2 dry
Texture-silt loam, very fine sandy loam or silty clay loam
Reaction--slightly acid to neutral 

Bg horizon:
Hue-2.5Y or 5Y
Value-4 to 6
Chroma-1 or 2
Texture-silt loam, very fine sandy loam or silty clay loam
Reaction-slightly acid to neutral
The Bg horizon typically has distinct to prominent redoximorphic concentrations

Bkg or Bk horizon:
Hue-2.5Y or 5Y
Value-5 or 6
Chroma-1 to 3
Texture-silt loam, very fine sandy loam or silty clay loam
Reaction--slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline
The Bkg or Bk horizon typically has distinct to prominent redoximorphic concentrations and or depletions

Cg or C horizon:
Hue-2.5Y or 5Y
Value-5 or 6
Chroma-1 to 3
Texture-silt loam, very fine sandy loam or silty clay loam
Reaction--slightly alkaline to neutral
The Cg or C horizon typically has distinct to prominent redoximorphic concentrations and or depletions

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bohnly, Kindred, Perella and Zeegee series. The Kindred and Perella soils--depth to carbonates is 50 centimeters or less
Bohnly soils--do not have secondary carbonates within the series control section
Zeegee soils--have 60 percent or more rock fragments in the lower third of the series control section

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material-loamy glaciolacustrine deposits 
Landform--flats on glacial lake plains
Slope-0 to 2 percent
Elevation--350 to 490 meters above sea level 
Mean annual air temperature-3 to 5 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation-635 to 711 millimeters
Frost Free period-95 to 125 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Littleswan and Sax soils which formed in the same parent material as the Alborn soils. Littleswan and Sax form a hydrosequence with the Alborn soils. The somewhat poorly drained Littleswan soils are on more sloping and higher lying positions on the landscape and are in the Aquollic Hapludalfs subgroup. The very poorly drained Sax soils are in drainageways and depressions and are in the Histic Humaquepts subgroup.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class--poorly drained--these soils have a frequently saturated zone occuring between depths of 0.15 and 0.3 meters during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean annual precipitation, this saturation is considered apparent
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--1.41 to 14.11 micrometers per second 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cropped for hay.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Physiographic Division--Interior Plains or Laurentian Upland
Physiographic Province--Central Lowland Province or Superior Upland
MLRA--Northern Minnesota Glacial Lake Basins (88)
LRR--K; northern Minnesota
Extent--small
