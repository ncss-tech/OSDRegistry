ASHER SERIES

The Asher series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium.  These soils are on nearly level to slightly convex high flood plains in the Central Rolling Red Prairies; MLRA 80A.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (62 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 914 mm (36 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, thermic Fluventic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Asher silty clay loam--cultivated.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     Ap--0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in); dark gray (10YR 4/1) silty clay loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak fine granular structure; hard, firm; many roots, many pores; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (18 to 51 cm [7 to 20 in] thick)

    Bw--25 to 53 cm (10 to 21 in); reddish brown (5YR 5/3) silty clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; weak fine blocky structure; very hard, firm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) coatings on faces of some peds; secondary carbonates below 14 in; slightly effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (25 to 61 cm [10 to 24 in] thick)

    2C--53 to 165 cm (21 to 65 in); brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable; common thin strata of brown very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam and silty clay loam; slightly effervescence; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma; about 1 mile north of McLoud, Oklahoma; about 1,200 feet north and 50 feet east of the southwest corner of sec. 3, T. 11 N., R. 2 E, Latitude 35 degrees, 27 minutes, 1 second north, Longitude 97 degrees, 5 minutes, 20 seconds west; NAD 83. McCloud, OK Topographic Quadrangle.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Solum thickness: 57 to 97 cm (20 to 38 in)  
Depth to secondary carbonates: 28 to 114 cm (11 to 45 in)

Sand Content: 0 to 20 percent

A horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 3 to 5
Chroma: 1 to 3
Texture: silt loam or silty clay loam
Clay content: 18 to 40 percent
Reaction: slightly acid to moderately alkaline

Bw horizon: 
Hue: 2.5YR to 10YR
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 2 to 6

Reaction: neutral to moderately alkaline

2C horizon 
Hue: 2.5YR to 10YR
Value: 4 to 7
Chroma: 2 to 8
Texture: stratified silt loam, silty clay loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy very fine sand
Strata: 1/8 inch to 6 in thick but are mostly less than 3 in thick  
Clay content: 5 to 18 percent
Reaction: neutral to moderately alkaline in the upper part and moderately alkaline and calcareous in the lower part

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ashport (MLRA 80A), Goodcreek (T) (MLRA 78B and 78C), and Lamkin (MLRA 84B and 85) series in the same family.  
Ashport, Goodcreek, and Lamkin soils: do not have coarse-silty textures in the lower part of the control section.  
Goodcreek and Lamkin soils: occur in a drier climate.
Lamkin soils: do not have Cambic horizons and have more than 18 percent clay in the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: calcareous loamy alluvium
Landform: nearly level to slightly convex rarely flooded flood plains of the major rivers in the Central Rolling Red Prairies 
Slopes: 0 to 1 percent
Mean annual temperature: 14 to 17 degrees C (57 to 62 degrees F) 
Mean annual precipitation: 762 to 965 mm (30 to 38 in)
Thornthwaite annual P-E indices: 44 to 64

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the similar Keokuk (MLRA 80A), Lela (MLRA 118 and 80A) and Miller (MLRA 78C and 80A) series.  
Keokuk soils: occur on the same flood plain but are closer to the river channel, and are coarse silty.  
Lela and Miller soils: have more than 35 percent clay in the control section and occur on the same flood plain, but are farther from the stream channel on slightly concave areas.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:   
Drainage: Moderately well drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: moderately low
Runoff: low 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for alfalfa, grain sorghum, soybeans, tame pasture, and small grains.  Native vegetation is tall grasses with scattered bottomland hardwood trees.  The Ecological Site is Loamy Bottomland PE 44-64 (R080AY050OK).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Oklahoma; LRR H; MLRA 80A; moderately extensive.
