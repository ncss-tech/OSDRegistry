AMBOYCRATER SERIES

The Amboycrater series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits. Amboy Crater soils are on smooth lake plains and have slopes of 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 72 degrees F.
