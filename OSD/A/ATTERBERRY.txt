ATTERBERRY SERIES

The Atterberry series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loess on uplands.  Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C (48 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is about 910 mm (36 inches).

TYPE LOCATION: Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) 108; Bureau County, Illinois; about 3 miles south and one mile east of Princeton; about 1,650 feet north and 1,120 feet east of the southwest corner of section 34, T. 16 N., R. 9 E.; USGS Princeton South quadrangle; Lat. 41 degrees, 19 minutes, 30 seconds N., Long. 89 degrees, 33 minutes, 15 seconds W., NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 107 to 183 centimeters (42 to 72 inches). The upper 51 centimeters (20 inches) of the argillic horizon averages between 25 and 35 percent clay. 

The Ap or A horizon has value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is moderately acid to neutral. 

The E horizon has value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2 and has redoximorphic features. It is strongly acid to neutral. 

BE or EB horizons are present in most pedons. 

The Bt or Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 through 4 and has redoximorphic features. It typically is silty clay loam, but some layers range to silt loam. It is moderately acid or strongly acid in the most acid part and ranges from strongly acid to neutral. BC or BCg horizons are present in most pedons. 

The C or Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 4. It is moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the upper part and slightly acid to slightly alkaline in the lower part. 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bethalto, Canoe, Curran, Emery, Franklin, Koszta, Millbrook, Mulvey, Virgil, and Wauconda soils. Bethalto soils have a mean annual soil temperature of greater than 14 degrees C (56 degrees F). Canoe and Emery soils have a sand content of more than 8 percent in the particle-size control section. Curran soils contain more sand in their lower B horizons. Franklin, Millbrook, and Wauconda soils have horizons with more than 10 percent sand within a depth of 102 centimeters (40 inches). Koszta soils are deeper to the layer highest in clay, and they have less contrast in clay content between the B and C horizons. Mulvey soils average more than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Virgil soils average more than 20 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Atterberry soils typically are nearly level to gently sloping and are on moderately wide ridgetops or upland divides on till plains. Less commonly they are on loess covered benches or high stream terraces. They formed in areas of transition between prairie grass and deciduous forest. Slope gradients range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges between 8 and 13 degrees C (45 to 54 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation between 760 and 1020 millimeters (30 to 40 inches). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Downs, Fayette, Muscatune, New Vienna, Osco, Stronghurst, and Tama soils. The well drained Downs and moderately well drained New Vienna soils form a drainage sequence with Atterberry soils. Fayette and Stronghurst soils have thinner or lighter colored surface 
layers. Muscatune, Osco, and Tama soils have mollic epipedons. Atterberry soils form a biosequence with Muscatune and Stronghurst soils. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is 4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second (moderate permeability).

USE AND VEGETATION: Atterberry soils are mostly cultivated. Corn, soybeans, small grains, and meadow are the major crops. Some areas are used for pasture. Native vegetation was mixed prairie grass and hardwood trees. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western, central, and northwestern Illinois, eastern Iowa, and southern Wisconsin. LRRs L and M, MLRAs 95A, 95B, 104, 105, 108A, 114, 115B, and 115C. Extent is large.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Cass County, Illinois, l939. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include: 
Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 33 centimeters (0 to 13 inches) (Ap and E horizons). 
Albic horizon - the zone from 23 to 33 centimeters (9 to 13 inches) (E horizon).
Argillic horizon - the zone from a depth of 43 to 122 centimeters (17 inches to 48 inches) (Bt, Btg1, Btg2, and Btg3 horizons). 

A sandy substratum phase has been mapped, but will be recorrelated during future MLRA update activities.
