ADIOS SERIES



The Adios series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained

soils that formed in residuum and slope alluvium from rhyolite and

andesite.  Adios soils are on sides of buttes and have slopes of 8 to

60 percent.  Permeability is very slow.  The average annual

precipitation is about 12 inches, and average annual air temperature is

about 47 degrees F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Argiduridic Durixerolls



TYPICAL PEDON:  Adios stony loam on a 15 percent slope at an elevation

of 4,940 feet in rangeland.  When described on May 18, 1983, the soil

was moist throughout.  (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise

noted.)



    A1--0 to 2 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) stony loam, dark brown (10YR

3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly

sticky and plastic; many very fine and fine and few medium and coarse

roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; about 5 percent pebbles,

about 3 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (1 to

4 inches thick)



    A2--2 to 5 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) stony loam, dark brown (10YR

3/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft friable,

slightly sticky and plastic; many very fine and fine and few medium and

coarse roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; about 5 percent

pebbles, about 10 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy

boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)



    Bt1--5 to 8 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam, dark

brown (10YR 3/3) moist; strong fine subangular blocky structure;

slightly hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common fine and medium roots;

common very fine and fine tubular pores; few thin clay films lining

pores and on faces of peds; about 5 percent pebbles, about 3 percent

stones; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 8 inches thick)



    Bt2--8 to 16 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay, dark

yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; strong fine and medium prismatic

structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common

fine and medium roots concentrated along vertical ped faces; common

fine tubular pores; many thick clay films lining pores and on faces of

peds; about 5 percent pebbles; mildly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy

boundary.  (4 to 16 inches thick)



    Bt3--16 to 20 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay,

yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate fine and medium prismatic

structure parting to strong fine and medium angular blocky; very hard,

very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine and medium roots

concentrated along vertical ped faces; few fine tubular pores; many

moderately thick clay films lining pores and on faces of peds; about 5

percent pebbles; mildly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to

9 inches thick)



    Btk--20 to 23 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) clay loam, light

yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; strong fine and medium angular blocky

structure; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common fine roots; few

fine tubular pores; few moderately thick clay films on faces of peds;

strong effervescence (20 percent calcium carbonate); about 10 percent

pebbles, about 3 percent stones; mildly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt

smooth boundary.  (1 to 6 inches thick)



    Bqkm--23 to 27 inches; white (10YR 8/2) indurated duripan, pale

brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; root mats on top of silica cap;

continuous silica cap 1 to 2mm thick at 23 inches; violent

effervescence (30 percent calcium carbonate); about 10 percent pebbles,

about 5 percent cobbles, about 3 percent stones; moderately alkaline

(pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)



    R--27 inches; fractured rhyolite with silica and calcium carbonate

in the fractures.



TYPE LOCATION:  Blaine County, Idaho about 3 miles southeast of the dam

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Barnard, Fleischmann, Seval, and

Xerta.  Barnard, Fleischmann, and Seval soils lack bedrock above 40

inches.  Fleischmann soils also lack an indurated duripan.  Xerta soils

have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the Btk horizon and have an

abrupt boundary between the A and Bt horizons.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Adios soils are on sides of buttes.  Slopes range

from 8 to 60 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,600 to 5,200 feet.  The

soil formed in residuum and slope alluvium from rhyolite and andesite.

The annual precipitation is 11 to 13 inches, most of which falls as

snow and early spring rain.  The annual air temperature is about 45 to

50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bostrum, Gooding,

Rehfield, and Yutrue.  Bostrum and Gooding soils lack a mollic

epipedon.  Rehfield soils have less than 35 percent clay in the

argillic horizon.  Yutrue soils lack a mollic epipedon and have cracks

from the surface to 20 inches at some time during the year.  These

soils all occur on the same landscape.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to very rapid runoff;

very slow permeability.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for rangeland.  Vegetation is Wyoming

big sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Adios soils are inextensive in south central

Idaho.
