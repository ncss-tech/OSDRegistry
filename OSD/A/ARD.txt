ARD SERIES

The Ard series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in rhyolite residuum with loess influence.  Ard soils are on mountain slopes and loess hills and have slopes of 4 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3.3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Calcic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Ard silt loam, cultivated, with a 4 percent slope at an elevation of 1,847 meters. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 Ap--0 to 18 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak very fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (10 to 25 cm thick)

 A1--18 to 28 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak very fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.

 A2--28 to 39 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizons is 10 to 25 cm)

 2Bk1--39 to 64 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; few extremely coarse  calcium carbonate nodules; common fine calcium carbonate threads and masses; calcium carbonate coats on bottoms of rock fragments; 10 percent fine gravel; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); clear smooth boundary.

 2Bk2--64 to 81 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) channery loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; calcium carbonate coats on bottoms of rock fragments; 20 percent channers, 5 percent gravel, and 5 percent flagstones; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); abrupt irregular boundary. (Combined thickness of the 2Bk horizons is 15 to 50 cm)

 2R--81 cm; light gray (5YR 7/1) rhyolite bedrock, gray (5YR 5/1) moist

TYPE LOCATION: Teton County, Idaho; about 16 km west of Felt; 10 meters east  and 372 meters north of the southwest corner of section 10, T. 6 N., R. 43 E.; Wright Creek USGS topographic quadrangle; lat. 43 degrees, 51 minutes, 28.4 seconds N. and long. 111 degrees, 22 minutes, 50.1 seconds W., NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Mollic epipedon thickness: 25 to 40 cm
Depth to bedrock: 50 to 100 cm

Mean annual soil temperature: 3.9 to 7.2 degrees C. (cryic soil temperature regime)
Mean summer soil temperature: 10.0 to 15.0 degrees C.

Ap horizon
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR moist
Value: 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry
Chroma: 2 or 3 moist and dry
Rock Fragments: 0 to 10 percent total fragments; 0 to 10 percent gravel, 0 to 2 percent flagstones and 0 to 2 percent stones

A horizon
Value: 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry
Chroma: 2 or 3 moist and dry
Texture: SIL or L with 0 to 10 percent total fragments; 0 to 10 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent channers, 0 to 5 percent cobbles, 0 to 2 percent flagstones and 0 to 2 percent stones

2Bk horizon
Value: 4 to 6 moist, 7 or 8 dry

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Corralridge, Parding, and Corralcreek (T) series.  Corralridge and Parding soils are very deep.  Corralcreek soils have 5 to 15 percent calcium carbonate in the calcic horizon and are formed over basalt.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: mountains
Landform: mountain slopes
Elevation: 1,794 to 2,213 meters
Slope: 4 to 12 percent
Parent material: rhyolite residuum with loess influence
Mean annual air temperature: 2.8 to 5.0 degrees C.
Mean annual precipitation: 406 to 660 mm

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Karlan, Greys, and Chokecherry series.  Karlan soils have a mollic epipedon that is greater than 40 cm thick and occur on the same landform but in linear positions.  Greys soils have an argillic horizon and occur on escarpments.  Chokecherry soils are less than 50 cm to a lithic contact and occur in concave swales.
