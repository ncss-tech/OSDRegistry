AMIRET SERIES

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Renville County, Minnesota, 1995. 

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters; series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
mollic epipedon-- the zone from the surface to a depth of 30 centimeters (Ap and A horizon);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 30 to 51 centimeters (Bw horizon); calcic horizon--the zone from a depth of 51 to 127 centimeters (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons);
udic moisture regime. 

This soil was formerly included in the Ves series. However, it was separated due to soil saturation in the lower part of the pedon in normal years. 

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
