AURAND SERIES

The Aurand series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are deep to dense till. They formed in loamy glaciolacustrine material 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) thick and the underlying till. They are on lake plains and beach ridges. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Crane, Mokena, Nachusa, Nenno, and Tiderishi series. None of these soils have a densic contact within the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Aurand soils are on lake plains and beach ridges of late Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The soils formed in loamy glaciolacustrine material 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) thick and the underlying till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 914 mm (27 to 36 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 165 days. Elevation is 183 to 244 meters (600 to 800 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the well drained Fox, Oshtemo, and Shawtown soils on beach ridges; the moderately well drained Vaughnsville soils on convex footslopes of beach ridges; the somewhat poorly drained Haskins soils on slight rises; and the very poorly drained Hoytville and Mermill soils on broad flats and swales of lake plains.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm (0.5 to 1.5 feet) between December and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is very low to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part of the solum and moderately low in the lower part of the solum and low in the substratum. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum, moderately slow or slow in the lower part of the solum, and slow or very slow in the substratum. 

USE AND VEGETATION: A large proportion is under cultivation, primarily corn, soybeans, wheat, and hay. A relatively small proportion is in woodland. Native vegetation is deciduous forest, principally ash, beech, elm, and maple.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Ohio, and possibly northeastern Indiana and southern Michigan; MLRA 99. The series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Hancock County, Ohio, 1997.

REMARKS: Aurand soils are being converted from Mermill and Haskins soils during modernization projects in MLRA 99.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 28 cm (Ap horizon).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 28 to 84 cm (Bt, Btg horizons).
Densic contact: at 122 cm (top of the 2Cd horizon).
Aquic conditions: redox features visible in all horizons below a depth of 28 cm.

Supporting laboratory data is needed to confirm the presence of densic materials in the 2Cd horizon.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory characterization data (HK-44) from The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory is available for the typical pedon.

Representative data mapunit is DMU ID 129960 in MO 11.
