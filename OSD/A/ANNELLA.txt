ANNELLA SERIES

The Annella series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived from tuff and breccia.  Annella soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 860 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 1.1 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, isotic Vitrandic Dystrocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Annella cobbly loam, on a north-facing, 15 percent slope in coniferous forest at an elevation of 3,440 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on July 10, 1984 the soil was moist throughout. Texture and pH are from NSSL data.

     Oe--0 to 10 cm; intermediately decomposed spruce needles and twigs; moderately acid (pH 5.7).  (0 to 15 cm thick)

     E--10 to 35 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) cobbly ashy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4), moist; weak very fine granular structure; very friable, soft, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few coarse roots; 10 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, 1 percent stones; very strongly acid (pH 4.6); abrupt wavy boundary.  (13 to 46 cm thick)

     Bs1--35 to 56 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very cobbly ashy sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4), moist; weak fine granular structure; very friable, soft, nonsticky, nonplastic; few coarse roots; 30 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, 2 percent stones; very strongly acid (pH 4.5); clear wavy boundary.

     Bs2--56 to 79 cm; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) very cobbly ashy sandy loam, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6), moist;  weak fine granular structure; very friable, soft, nonsticky, nonplastic; 30 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, 3 percent stones; very strongly acid (pH 4.9); clear wavy boundary.  (combined thickness of the Bw horizons is 25 to 100 cm)

     C1--79 to 112 cm; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) very cobbly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6), moist; massive; friable, soft, nonsticky, nonplastic; 30 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, 3 percent stones; strongly acid (pH 5.3); gradual wavy boundary.  

     C2--112 to 160 cm; yellow (10YR 7/6) very cobbly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/8), moist; massive; friable, soft, nonsticky, nonplastic; 30 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, 3 percent stones; strongly acid (pH 5.3).

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES PROPOSED:  Rio Grande County, Rio Grande National Forest, West Part soil survey area, 2008. This series was drafted for use in the adjoining Archuleta and Piedra soil survey areas, using the modal pedon for the Leighcan series from the Rio Grande National Forest Area. This pedon no longer fits the Leighcan series because of its parent material lithology and its content of volcanic glass and oxalate Fe and Al content (Vitrandic feature); these Vitrandic features were not known until recently. The name is taken from a small lake a few miles from the type location in Conejos County.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Cambic horizon:  35 to 79 cm (Bs1, Bs2 horizons)
Vitrandic feature: 35 to 79 cm (Bs1 and Bs2 horizons)
Particle-size control section:  35 to 110 cm (Bs1, Bs2, and part of C1 horizon)

The cambic horizon does not qualify for a spodic horizon because it does not have twice the amount of acid oxalate Al+1/2Fe or twice the ODOE as the E horizon.

Annella soils have a cryic soil temperature regime and are in a udic soil moisture regime with a typic subclass. 

ADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL sample S84CO105-004 (sampled as Leighcan).
