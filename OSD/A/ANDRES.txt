ANDRES SERIES 

The Andres series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy outwash and the underlying silty till on ground moraines and lake plains. A mantle of loess or other silty material, as much as 61 cm (24 inches), overlies the outwash in many pedons. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 890 mm (35 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquic Argiudolls

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Aztalan, Darroch, Francesville, Gilboa, Houstenader, La Hogue, Lahoguess, Le Sueur, Marcellon, Newhaven, Odell, and Protivin series. Aztalan and Marcellon soils average less than 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Darroch, Gilboa, La Hogue, Lahoguess, Le Sueur, Newhaven, and Odell soils average more than 20 percent sand and less than 22 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Francesville soils contain a densic layer between 51 to 102 cm (20 and 40 inches). Houstenader soils contain more than 40 percent clay and more than 15 percent gravel in the lower part of the series control section. Protivin soils contain more than 30 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Andres soils are on nearly level to slightly undulating till plains and lake plains. They formed in loamy outwash and silty till that contain more than 22 percent clay. A mantle of loess or other silty material, as much as 61 cm (24 inches) thick, overlies the outwash in many pedons. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.8 to 12.2 degrees C (46 to 54 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 1016 mm (32 to 40 inches), frost-free period ranges from 155 to 190 days, and elevation ranges from 166 to 311 meters (545 to 1,020 feet) above sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ashkum, Elliott, Martinton, Milford, and Symerton soils. Ashkum and Milford soils are on lower positions on the landform, are poorly drained, and contain more clay in the particle-size control section. Elliott and Martinton soils are on similar positions and have more clay in the particle-size control section. Symerton soils are on slightly higher positions and are better drained. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. These soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 31 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) at some time between January and May in most years. The potential for surface runoff is low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers/s). Permeability is moderately slow. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of the soil are cultivated. Corn, soybeans, small grain, and meadow are the principal crops. A few areas are used for pasture. Native vegetation is tall prairie grasses. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern Illinois and northwestern Indiana. Extent is large; about 118,000 acres have been mapped in MLRAs 95B, 108A, 110, 111C, and 111D.
