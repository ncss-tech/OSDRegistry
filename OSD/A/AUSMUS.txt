AUSMUS SERIES

The Ausmus series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained or moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks and volcanic ash.  Ausmus soils are on low lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6.5 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ausmus soils are on drainageways and depressions on low lake terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,219 to 1,372 meters.  The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Poujade, Crowcamp, Fury, Lawen, and Lolak soils.  Crowcamp, Fury, Lawen, and Lolak soils lack natric horizons. In addition  Crowcamp, Lawen, and Fury soils have mollic epipedons. Poujade soils are moderately well drained. Lolak soils are poorly drained. Lolak soils are on low lake terraces. Crowcamp, Lawen and Poujade soils are on high lake terraces.  Fury soils are on stream terraces.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained or moderately well drained; moderately slow permeability (moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity).  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 76 and 100 cm (moderately deep free water occurrence class) from March through May.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  The soil surface is saturated in the spring.  These soils are susceptible to rare ponding from March through May or they are susceptible to frequent ponding for long duration from March through May with water up to 15 cm deep.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Ausmus soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The potential native vegetation is basin wildrye, black greasewood, and inland saltgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Oregon.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 23.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 5 cm (A horizon).

Natric horizon - The zone from 5 to 23 cm (Btkn horizon).

Endosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 76 and 100 cm at certain times during normal years (parts of the Bknz2 and Bknz3 horizons).

Particle-size control section - The zone from 5 to 100 cm (Btkn, Bkn, Bknz1, and Bknz2 horizons and part of the Bknz3 horizon).

ADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has full characterization data by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as user pedon ID 93OR025005 (pedon # 93P0792).  Other characterization data is available for pedon 93OR025003 (pedon # 93P0790) as well as a similar pedon 93OR025004 (pedon # 93P0791) that is sodic but lacks a natric horizon.
