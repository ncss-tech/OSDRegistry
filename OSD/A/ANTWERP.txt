ANTWERP SERIES

The Antwerp series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces and sedimentary plains. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid Aridic Ustorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Antwerp silty clay loam, grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 1 inch; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) silty clay loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; weak fine platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (1/2 inch to 3 inches thick)

    Bw--1 inch to 6 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak medium angular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; strongly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 7 inches thick)

    Bz1--6 to 15 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak medium angular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; many fine masses of salt; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 22 inches thick)

    Bz2--15 to 24 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) silty clay loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; common medium masses of salt; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual irregular boundary.  (8 to 26 inches thick)

    BC--24 to 60 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual irregular boundary.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Rosebud County, Montana, 1979.  The origin of the name is from a Milwaukee Road (Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul, and Pacific Railroad Co.) siding.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT0547.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches (mixed) (A, Bw, part of Bz1 horizons); horizons of salt accumulation from 6 to 15 inches (Bz1, Bz2 horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bz1, Bz2, BC horizons).  Antwerp soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
