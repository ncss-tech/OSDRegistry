ACADIANA SERIES

The Acadiana series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy and clayey alluvium of late Pleistocene age.  These very gently sloping to gently sloping soils are on side slopes of erosional stream channels on uplands.  Slopes are dominantly 1 to 3 percent, but range to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1549 mm (61 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Boswell (MS) and Gore (LA)series in the same family.  Similar soils are the Acadia (LA), Anahuac (TX), Iota (LA), Orcadia (TX), and Woodville (TX) series.  
Boswell and Gore soils: have an upper argillic that is redder than 7.5YR; do not have a glossic horizon
Acadia soils: do not have vertic properties within 127 cm (50 in) of the mineral soil surface.  
Anahuac soils have a mollic epipedon; glossic horizon in the lower part of the pedon.   
Iota (LA) and Woodville (TX)soils: do not have a loamy upper Bt horizon. Orcadia, and also Iota, and Woodville soils: have smectitic mineralogy.  Iota soils have a clay decrease within 60 in from the mineral soil surface.  In addition, Anahuac and Orcadia soils have a hyperthermic soil temperature regime.

Crowley and Kaplan soils: do not have a glossic horizon; on convex ridges and sideslopes at higher elevations.  
Iota soils: do not have a glossic horizon; on steeper side slopes.
Kinder soils:  fine-silty particle-size control section; on broad stream divides at higher elevations.  
Vidrine soils: coarse-silty over clayey particle-size control section; are on circular mounds at higher elevations.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Permeability is very slow. Runoff is very high.  This soil has water perched above the clayey Bt horizon and is saturated from about 30 to 91 cm (12 to 36 in) below the soil surface for more than 1 month during December to April, but does not meet aquic conditions in normal years.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of the acreage is in pasture and woodland.  Woodland is mostly loblolly pine with mixed hardwoods.  Pasture is mainly bahiagrass or common bermudagrass.  The remaining acreage is in cropland, mainly cotton, soybeans, corn, wheat, or rice.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southcentral to southwest Louisiana; Gulf Coast Prairie (MLRA 150A) of Louisiana; LRR T.  The series is of moderate extent.

REMARKS:  The Acadiana soils were formerly included in the Acadia series.The classification was changed during the soil data join recorrelation initiative.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - 0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 in) (Ap and E horizon).
Argillic horizon - 23 to 109 cm (9 to 43 in) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt/E, B't, and Btss horizons).
Glossic horizon - 48 to 61 cm (19 to 24 in) (Bt/E horizons).
Active class - CEC to clay ratio in the particle-size control section ranges from 0.45 to 0.55.
