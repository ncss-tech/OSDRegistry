ABRACON SERIES

The Abracon series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from sandstone, shale, limestoneand quartzite.  Abracon soils are on fan remnants, hills, toeslopes, or mesas.  Slopes range from 1 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.

Potential vegetation consists of Wyoming big sagebrush, winterfat, Indian ricegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, galleta, and needleandthread.  This soil has been correlated to the Semidesert Loam (Wyoming Big Sagebrush) - (034XY212UT) range site at the type location in Utah.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Uintah county (Dinosaur National Monument Area), Utah. 1997.  The name is coined.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (Bk1, Bk2, and Bk3 horizons)
Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 4 inches (A horizon) 
Calcic horizon - from 10 to 51 inches (Bkl, Bk2, Bk3 horizons) 

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Partial reference sample from pedon S93 UT-047-001 in Uintah County, Utah.  Laboratory data shows a high percentage of clay sized carbonates causing it to have a coarse-loamy PSCS.  The cation exchange activity class was determined from laboratory data.
