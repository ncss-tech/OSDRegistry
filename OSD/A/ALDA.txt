ALDA SERIES

The Alda series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained or moderately well drained, soils that formed in 20 to 40 inches of stratified loamy alluvium over coarse sand or gravelly sand on flood plains.  These soils are moderately deep over coarse sand or gravelly sand and have slope ranging from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is 11 degrees C (51 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is 64 centimeters (25 inches).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Oxyaquic Haplustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Alda fine sandy loam -in a cultivated field; when described, the water table was at a depth of 152 centimeters (60 inches). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

COMPETING SERIES: These are no competing series.  
Closely similar soils are the Marksbutte, Novina, Ovina, Sunset, Wann, Cass, Darr, Lex, and Ord soils.  
Marksbutte soils may be saturated for less than 90 days during the growing season and salinity is more than 4 mmhos throughout.  
Novina, Ovina, Sunset, Wann, and Cass soils lack coarse sand or gravelly sand above a depth of 40 inches.  
Cass soils are better drained.  
Darr soils are similar in depth to coarse sand or gravelly sand but are better drained.  
Lex soils are in the fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal texture class.  
Ord soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.

Mean annual temperature: 9 to 13 degrees C (48 to 55 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 46 to 76 centimeters (18 to 30 inches).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Cass, Darr, Lex, Gibbon, Inavale, Leshara, Ovina, Platte and Wann soils.  
Gibbon and Leshara soils are fine-silty. 
Inavale soils lack a mollic epipedon and are in the sandy texture class.  
Platte soils have coarse sand or gravelly sand at a depth of 25 to 51 centimeters (10 to 20 inches).

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage: somewhat poorly drained or moderately well drained  
Runoff: low.  
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: upper part is high; underlying gravelly sand is very high.  
Seasonal zone of saturation:  .5 to 1 meter (1.5 to 4.5 feet).  2 to 3 meters (6 to 8 feet) during the late summer and fall in some years.  
Flooding: rarely or occasionally 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are in irrigated cultivated crops.
Main crops are corn, soybeans, alfalfa, and grain sorghum.  
The remaining acreage is principally in native hay.  
Native vegetation is big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, Indiangrass, and prairie cordgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central and western Nebraska.  The soil series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Douglas County, Nebraska; 1970.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:  
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 51 centimeters (0 to 20 inches) (Ap, A and AC horizon) 
Aquic soil conditions: 76 to 203 centimeters (30 to 80 inches) (2Cg1 and 2Cg2 horizons).
A saline phase is recognized.  
Stratification is present within the soil profile usually only where intermittent drains flow through or are adjacent to the Alda soil delineation.  AC horizons may not be present in all soil profiles.

OSD Modifications: 

(9/5/2003 PRF) made minor gramatical edits and updated the competing series.
(5/2002 RRZ)  Recommend that taxonomy be changed from COARSE-LOAMY, MIXED SUPERACTIVE, MESIC FLUVAQUENTIC HAPLUSTOLLS to COARSE-LOAMY, MIXED SUPERACTIVE, MESIC OXYAQUIC HAPLUSTOLLS; 
Water depth changed to 1.5 to 4.5 ft.; Natural Drainage Class changed from somewhat poorly drained to somewhat poorly drained to moderately well drained; solum thickness increased to 71 centimeters (28 inches);, A saline phase of the Alda Series is recognized with EC.2 to 8 mmhos/cm.
Changed permeability to Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity 9/05. JCR
