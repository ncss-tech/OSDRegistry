ATTICA SERIES 

The Attica series consists of deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in eolian sediments . These soils are on dunes on paleo-terraces in river valleys of the Great Bend Sand Plains (MLRA 79). Mean annual precipitation is 28 inches (71 centimeters), and mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F (13 degrees C). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Udic Haplustalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON: Attica fine sandy loam - in a cultivated field. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.) 

  Ap--0 to 10 inches (0 to 25 centimeters); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary. (8 to 20 inches thick; 20 to 51 centimeters thick) 

  Bt--10 to 21 inches (25 to 53 centimeters); brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; clay bridges between sand grains; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. (6 to 18 inches thick; 15 to 46 centimeters thick) 

  BC--21 to 39 inches (53 to 99 centimeters); brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable; neutral; gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 20 inches thick; 0 to 50 centimeters thick) 

  C--39 to 80 inches (99 to 203 centimeters); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) fine sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable; neutral. 

TYPE LOCATION: Stafford County, Kansas; 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) north and 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) east of Macksville; 2,490 feet (759 meters) east and 300 feet (91 meters) south of the northwest corner of sec. 2, T. 24 S., R. 15 W. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Mean annual soil temperature: 56 to 58 degrees F (13 to 14 degrees C)
Particle-size control section: 8 to 17 percent clay
Depth to secondary calcium carbonate: greater than 30 inches (76 centimeters)
Thickness of the ochric epipedon: 8 to 20 inches (20 to 50 centimeters)

A horizon:

Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 to 6 (dry) 3 or 4 (moist)
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy fine sand
Reaction: moderately acid to neutral

Bt horizon:

Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 to 6 (dry) 3 to 5 (moist)
Chroma: 2 to 5

Chroma: 3 to 6
Texture: fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand
Reaction: slightly acid to moderately alkaline 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Hayes and Poxmash series in the same family. Hayes soils have a buried soil at depths greater than 30 inches (76 centimeters) that contain 19 to 45 percent clay. Poxmash soils are moderately deep overlying weathered Permian shale.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Attica soils

Parent material: eolian sediments
Landform: nearly level to undulating wind modified dunes on paleo-terraces
Slopes: 0 to 6 percent
Elevation: 1400 to 1900 feet (426.7 to 579.1 meters)
Mean annual air temperature: 55 to 57 degrees F (13 to 14 degrees C)
Mean annual precipitation: 24 to 28 inches (61 to 71 centimeters)
Wettest months: Mar. - Oct.
Driest months: Nov. - Feb.
Frost-free period: 187 to 225 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Albion, Carbika, Carway, Carwile, Hayes, Naron, Pratt, Saltcreek, Solvay, Shellabarger, Turon and Warnut soils. The Hayes and Naron soils are on similar positions. The more clayey and more poorly drained Carbika, Carway, Carwile and Warnut soils are on lower positions. The Pratt, Saltcreek and Turon soils occur on steeper slopes than Attica soils. The Albion and Shellabarger soils occur on lower positions on similar landforms. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage: Well drained. 
Permeability: moderately rapid. 
Runoff: slow. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Mostly in cultivation with wheat, grain sorghums, and alfalfa the principal crops. The sandier type is often in native range. Some acreage is in tame pasture. Native vegetation is tall prairie grasses. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South Central Kansas. LRR H Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range, MLRA 79 Great Bend Sand Plains. This series is of large extent.
