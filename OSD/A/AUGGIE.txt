AUGGIE SERIES 

The Auggie series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on lacustrine terraces in glaciated valleys.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, active Eutric Glossocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Auggie silt loam, in coniferous forest.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    0i--0 to 2 inches; undecomposed and slightly decomposed forest litter. 

    E--2 to 8 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick) 

    Bt/E--8 to 22 inches; B part (75 percent) is light brown (7.5YR 6/4) silty clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; with interfingering of E part (25 percent) is pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) silt loam, pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) moist; texture mixed is silty clay loam; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 20 inches thick) 

    Bt--22 to 47 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) silty clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; few fine and mediuim roots; many distinct clay films on faces of peds and along root channels; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); gradual smooth boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick) 

    C--47 to 60 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/4) silt loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak medium platy lacustrine sediments; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5).

There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 

Landform - lacustrine terraces in glaciated valleys. 
Elevation - 3,400 to 4,400 feet. 
Slope - 2 to 30 percent. 
Parent material - glaciolacustrine deposits. 
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers. 
Mean annual precipitation - 24 to 35 inches, much of which falls as snow and as spring rain. 
Mean annual temperature - 37 to 42 degrees F. 
Frost-free season - 50 to 70 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderately slow permeability to a depth of 45 inches and moderate permeability below this depth. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Auggie soils are used for timber production, as wildlife habitat, for watersheds, and for recreation. The native vegetation is coniferous forest consisting of subalpine fir, western larch, Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine, and Engelmann spruce with an understory of blue huckleberry, common beargrass, twinflower, pinegrass, and queencup beadlily. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Auggie soils are inextensive in western Montana. MLRA 44A.

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretation Record:  MT0562.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from 2 to 8 inches (E horizon); an argillic horizon from 8 to 47 inches (Bt/E, Bt horizons); a particle-size control section from 8 to 28 inches (Bt/E, Bt horizons).
