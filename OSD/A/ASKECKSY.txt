COMPETING SERIES: None

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: Coastal plain lowlands
Landform: Low-lying uplands, broad depressions, floodplains, and stream terraces
Elevation: 0 to 60 feet
Parent Material: Sandy alluvial and marine sediments
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 54 to 58 degrees F.
Mean Annual Precipitation: 43 to 46 inches
Frost Free Period: 175 to 200 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Berryland soils--very poorly drained spodosol with an umbric epipedon, on similar landforms
Hammonton soils--moderately well drained with an argillic horizon and a coarse-loamy particle-size control section, on higher-lying positions
Hurlock soils--have an argillic horizon and a coarse-loamy particle-size control section, on low-lying uplands and depressions
Klej soils--somewhat poorly drained, on slightly higher-lying positions
Mullica soils--very poorly drained, have an umbric epipedon and a coarse-loamy particle-size control section, on similar landforms

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
  Agricultural Drainage Class: Poorly drained
  Index Surface Runoff: Negligible
  Internal Free Water Occurance: Very shallow; common
  Permeability: Rapid

USE AND VEGETATION:
  Major Uses: Some areas are cleared and used for growing corn, soybeans and small grain.  Most cleared areas were drained with open ditch drainage systems during the first half of this century.  
  Dominant Vegetation: Wooded areas are dominantly red maple, sweet gum, white oak, willow oak, and loblolly pine.  Understory is dominantly greenbriar, American holly, sweetbay, and lowbush blueberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
  Distribution: Coastal Plain of Delaware, New Jersey, and possibly Maryland
  Extent: Moderate

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Worcester County, MD, 1995

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 8 inches (A horizon).
Aquic conditions--the zone from 8 inches to a depth of 80 inches is periodically saturated (endosaturation)
