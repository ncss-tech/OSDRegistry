AMBRANT SERIES

The Ambrant series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium or alluvium derived from igneous rocks. These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, and mountains. Slopes are 0 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Lamellic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ambrant gravelly sandy loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 5 cm; undecomposed and slightly decomposed forest litter.

    E1--5 to 15 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine pores; 25 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 25 cm thick)

    E2--15 to 56 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) gravelly coarse sandy loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; strong fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine pores; 25 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 41 cm thick)

    E and Bt--56 to 104 cm; E part (75 percent) is light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; Bt part (25 percent) is dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) gravelly sandy loam lamellae very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; lamellae are 3 to 10 mm thick; texture mixed is gravelly coarse sandy loam; weak fine and medium blocky structure parting to moderate fine and medium granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky, and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine pores; 30 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary. (38 to 76 cm thick)

    2C--104 to 157 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) very gravelly coarse sand, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; single grain; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 55 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.2).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; moderately rapid permeability in the coarse-loamy material and rapid permeability in the sandy or sandy-skeletal material.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Ambrant soils are used as woodland, wildlife habitat, and watersheds.  The native vegetation is lodgepole pine, ponderosa pine, and Douglas fir with an understory of pinegrass, common snowberry, elk sedge, and white spiraea.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Ambrant soils are moderately extensive in western Montana. MLRAs 43A, 43B
