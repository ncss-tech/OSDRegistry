ABILENE SERIES

The Abilene series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous alluvium or outwash. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils occur on terraces on dissected plains. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm (26 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 17.2 degrees C (63 degrees F).
 
TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, thermic Pachic Argiustolls
 
TYPICAL PEDON: Abilene clay loam in cropland.
     (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  Ap--0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; hard, friable; neutral; clear smooth boundary. Thickness is 15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 in)

Thickness is 20 to 61 cm (8 to 24 in)

  BCk1--97 to 127 (38 to 50 in); pink (7.5YR 8/4) clay, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; mixture of segregated calcium carbonate and light brown clay containing many calcium carbonate masses and concretions; moderately alkaline; violently effervescent; diffuse wavy boundary.

  BCk2--127 to 165 cm (50 to 65 in); light brown (7.5YR 6/4) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; less segregated calcium carbonate than in the BCk horizon; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline. Combined thickness is 25 to 64 cm (10 to 25 in)

Altus and Miles soils: occur on higher areas, have less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and, in addition, Miles soils do not have mollic epipedons. 
Hollister and Roscoe soils: occur on slightly lower concave areas and have intersecting slickensides. 
Rowena soils: occur on similar positions.
Sagerton soils: occur on slightly higher convex areas.
 
DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderately slow. Runoff is negligible on slopes less than 1 percent and very low on 1 to 3 percent slopes. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly cultivated to cotton, wheat, and grain sorghum. Native vegetation is buffalograss, blue grama, sideoats grama, and vine-mesquite. Some areas have mesquite trees.
