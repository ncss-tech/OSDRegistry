AECET SERIES

The Aecet series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in reworked eolian deposits.  These soils are on lava plains and have slopes of 0 to 12 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Xeric Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Aecet very stony sandy loam, rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     A--0 to 5 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very stony sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak very thin platy structure parting to weak very fine granular; loose; nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 7 inches thick)

     Bw--5 to 13 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3 moist; weak fine and medium angular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 11 inches thick)

     Bk--13 to 23 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; about 5 percent basalt gravel and cobbles; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (6 to 22 inches thick)

     2R--23 inches; basalt.

TYPE LOCATION:  Jefferson County, Idaho; 300 feet north, 1,980 feet east of the SW corner of sec. 14, T.7N., R.34E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Profile:
Depth to calcic horizon - 5 to 17 inches
Depth to bedrock - 20 to 40 inches
Average annual soil temperature - 41 to 45 degrees F.
Average summer soil temperature - 65 to 68 degrees F.
The soils are usually dry and are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for a continuous period of about 70 to 90 days in the late summer.

Particle-size control section:
Clay content average - 18 to 35 percent (total clay)
Rock fragments - 5 to 10 percent angular basaltic gravel
Textures - L, SIL, SCL, or CL (15 percent or more fine sand or coarser)

A horizon:
Value - 5 or 6 dry
Chroma - 2 or 3 dry or moist

Bw horizon:
Value - 6 or 7 dry
Chroma - 2 or 3 dry or moist

Bk horizon:
Value - 7 or 8 dry
Chroma - 1 through 3 dry or moist

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alhark and Atomic series.  Alhark soils are deep and very deep.  Atomic soils are very deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Aecet soils are on lava plains at elevations of 4,500 to 5,500 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  The soils formed in eolian deposits.  The semiarid climate has a frost-free period of 80 to 115 days and an average annual precipitation of 8 to 11 inches.   Maximum precipitation falls in May and June.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bereniceton, Bondfarm, and Grassy Butte soils.  Bereniceton soils do not have a B horizon.  Bondfarm soils are less than 20 inches deep over bedrock.  Grassy Butte soils have a sandy particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow or medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for range, wildlife habitat, recreation.  The principal native plants are big sagebrush, rabbitbrush, and wheatgrasses, squirreltail and prickly pear cactus.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central southeastern Idaho.  The series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Jefferson County, Idaho, 1975.

REMARKS:  This revision (5/95) changes the classification from Xerollic Calciorthids to Xeric Haplocalcids according to the 1994 edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy.  The Competing Series Section was not updated at this time.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Cambic horizon - the zone from 5 to 13 inches (BA and Bw horizons)

Calcic horizon - the zone from 13 to 23 inches (Bk horizon)

Particle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 23 inches (part of the Bw and the Bk horizon)
