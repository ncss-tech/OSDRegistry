REMARKS: The Arapahoe series were formerly mapped in the Pocomoke and Torhunta series.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are :

Umbric epipedon -the zone from the surface to a depth of 17 inches (the Ap and A horizons).

Cambic horizon -from a depth of 17 inches to a depth of 42 inches (Bg1, Bg2 and BCg horizons).

Aquic feature -mottles with chromas of 2 or less below a depth of 11 inches.
