ASAAYI SERIES 

The Asaayi series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium from sandstone and shale.  Asaayi soils are on cuestas and hills and have slopes of 2 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, active, frigid Lithic Haplustalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Asaayi fine sandy loam - woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

  Oi--0 to 1 inch; decomposing pine needles and other forest litter. 

  A--1 to 4 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; moderate thin platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 4 inches thick) 

 Bt--4 to 9 inches; yellowish red (5YR 4/6) sandy clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; common fine and very fine irregular pores; few faint clay films lining pores and on faces of peds; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 16 inches thick) 

 2R--9 inches; sandstone.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competitors.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Asaayi soils are on dipslopes of cuestas and hills and have slopes of 2 to 25 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium from sandstone and shale. Elevations range from 7,500 to 8000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 40 to 47 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Osoridge soil.  Osoridge soils have bedrock at depths of less than 20 inches. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Medium to high runoff.  Moderate and moderately slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Asaayi soils are used for timber production and grazing.  The present vegetation is ponderosa pine, blue grama, muttongrass and lupine. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern New Mexico and Northeastern Arizona.  This series is of moderate extent. MLRA 35.
