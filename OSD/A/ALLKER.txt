ALLKER SERIES

The Allker series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess.  Allker soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 225 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TYPE LOCATION:  Eureka County, Nevada; about 22 miles southeast of Crescent Valley; approximately 1,500 feet west and 2,200 feet north of the southeast corner of section 28, T. 26 N., R. 49 E.; USGS Rocky Hills 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 6 minutes 21 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 27 minutes 4 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.1058333 latitude, -116.4511111 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist in winter and spring, dry June through October; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C.
Depth to discontinuous weak silica cementation: 56 to 89 cm.
Depth to secondary carbonates: 40 to 60 cm.
Depth to sandy-skeletal material: 60 to 97 cm.
Other features: Nonsaline or slightly saline below a depth of 56 cm.

A horizons
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist (greater than 5.5 dry and 3.5 moist when the surface 18 cm are mixed).
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Reaction:  Neutral to moderately alkaline.

Bt horizons
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4.

Clay content:  20 to 30 percent.
Rock fragments:  15 to 30 percent, mainly gravel.
Consistence: Slightly hard or hard dry, friable or firm moist, slightly sticky or moderately sticky and slightly plastic or moderately plastic wet.
Structure:  Weak to strong fine to coarse subangular or angular blocky.
Reaction:  Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.
Other features:  Carbonate segregations are common to lower subhorizons of some pedons; most pedons commonly have durinodes in some subhorizon.

Bqk horizon

Chroma:  1 through 4.
Rock fragments:  15 to 30 percent, mainly gravel.
Consistence:  Hard or very hard dry, friable or firm moist.
Reaction:  Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.
Other features:  Few thin or very thin discontinuous silica laminae are common in some pedons; some pedons have durinodes in a friable matrix below the weakly cemented horizon.

2Bqk horizon

Chroma: 3 through 6.
Texture:  Very gravelly loamy sand or very gravelly sand.
Rock fragments:  35 to 60 percent, mainly gravel.
Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Gorzell series.  Gorzell soils are 25 to 46 cm to the base of the argillic horizon and underlying horizons with secondary silica.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Allker soils are on fan remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 1,680 to 2,260 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Tenabo and Whirlo soils.  Tenabo soils have a shallow indurated duripan.  Whirlo soils have a cambic horizon and are loamy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Allker soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, downy rabbitbrush, Sandberg's bluegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, and Thurber's needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 24, 25.
