ASHLEYLAKE SERIES

The Ashleylake series consist of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous glacial till with minor amounts of volcanic ash in the surface layers. These soils are on moraines in glaciated valleys and on mountain slopes. Slopes are 4 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ashleylake soils are on moraines in glaciated valleys and on mountain slopes. Elevations are 2,900 to 5,400 feet. Slopes are 4 to 60 percent. These soils formed in calcareous till. The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm, dry summers. Mean annual effective precipitation is 22 to 30 inches, much of which falls as snow or as spring rain. Mean annual temperature is 38 to 44 degrees F. The frost-free period is 70 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Jimlake, Foyslake, McMannamy, and Kingspoint series. Jimlake soils are cryic and are at higher elevations on similar aspects and have more volcanic ash in the surface layer. Foyslake soils are on similar landscape positions but have minimal volcanic ash in the surface layer. McMannamy and Kingspoint soils are ustic and are on warmer aspects.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Ashleylake soils are used for timber production and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is Grand Fir, Engelmann spruce, western larch, and Douglas-fir, with an understory of queencup beadlily, twinflower, bunchberry dogwood, western meadowrue, sweetscented bedstraw, pinegrass, snowberry, dwarf huckleberry, and Rocky mountain maple.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Ashleylake soils are of limited extent in northwestern Montana. MLRA 43A.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES PROPOSED: Flathead County, Montana 2005. The name is from Ashley Lake in Flathead County.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: an ash influenced layer from 1 to 14 inches (E1 and E2 horizons); an ochric epipedon from 0 to 14 inches (Oi, E1 and E2 horizons); an albic horizon from 1 to 14 inches (E1 and E2 horizons; a glossic horizon from 14 to 30 inches (E/Bt and Bt/E horizons); an argillic horizon from 23 to 40 inches (lower half of the Bt/E and Bt horizon); a calcic horizon at 40 inches (Bk horizon); a particle-size control section from 23 to 40 inches (Bt/E and Bt horizons). Ashleylake soils have a frigid temperature regime and a udic moisture regime.
