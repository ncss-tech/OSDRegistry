ARMISTEAD SERIES

The Armistead series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, soils that formed in reddish clayey over loamy alluvium. These soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping alluvial plains of the Red River. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Red River Parish, Louisiana; 1973. The name is from a nearby community. 

REMARKS: 
These soils were formerly classified in the Alluvial great soil group. These soils are considered to have argillic horizons, though the 2Bt horizons do not have the required clay increase for an argillic horizon. The higher clay content in the 2A horizon is due to mixing with the overwash clay A horizon. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Particle-size control section: 62 to 112 cm (24 to 44 in) (2Bt1, 2Bt2 and 2 Bt3 horizons) 
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 62 cm (0 to 24 in) (Ap, A and 2Ab horizons) 
Argillic horizon: 62 to 135 cm (24 to 53 in) (2Bt1, 2Bt2 and 2Bt3 horizons) 
Redoximorphic depletions: 35 to 62 cm (14 to 24 in) (2Ab horizons) 
Lithologic discontinuity: upper boundary of the 2Ab horizon 35 cm (14 in) 

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by KSSL laboratory data number S2010LA081001 from Red River Parish, Louisiana.
