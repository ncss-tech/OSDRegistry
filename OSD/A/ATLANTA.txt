ATLANTA SERIES

The Atlanta series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from limestone with lesser amounts of welded tuff. Atlanta soils are on fan aprons, fan skirts and inset fans that receive occasional flooding. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Adkins, Bertelson, Briabbit, Crestline, Declo, Eoyote, Escalante, Kecko, Sagehill, Somsen, and Strevell series. 

Adkins soils lack carbonates above 60 cm. Bertelson soils do not have very gravelly or extremely gravelly horizons within the particle-size control section and are dominated by alluvium from tuff and ignimbrite. Briabbit soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts. Crestline soils do not have very gravelly or extremely gravelly horizons within the control section and are not calcareous above the calcic horizon. Declo soils have 0 to 15 percent gravel in the particle-size control section. Eoyote soils lack gravel in the particle-size control section. Escalante soils do not have very gravelly or extremely gravelly horizons within the particle-size control section. Kecko soils are 50 to 100 cm deep to carbonates and have 0 to 10 percent gravel in the control section. Sagehill soils are 25 to 76 cm deep to carbonates and have 0 to 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Somsen soils are moderately deep over hard bedrock. Strevell soils are 10 to 25 cm deep to carbonates and have Bk horizons with silt loam or loam textures. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Atlanta soils are at elevations of 1,680 to 1,985 meters. They are on fan aprons, fan skirts and inset fans that receive occasional flooding. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. They formed in alluvium derived from limestone with lesser amounts of welded tuff. The climate is semiarid mid-latitude steppe with cold winters and hot summers. Average annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm. Mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C and the mean summer temperature is 19 to 22 degrees C. The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Kunzler, Rouette and Ursine. Kunzler soils have calcic horizons containing durinodes. Rouette and Ursine soils are shallow to a duripan. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very low or low runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Atlanta soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Present vegetation is basin big sagebrush, basin wildrye and Indian ricegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28A.
