AWLEY SERIES


The Awley series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils with moderately rapid permeability that formed in colluvium from basalt and volcanic ash. Slopes range from15 to 65 percent in mountains. The average annual precipitation is about 33 inches and the average annual temperature is about 38 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, isotic Andic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Awley ashy loam, forested -- on a north-facing slope of 45 percent at 6,340 feet elevation. When described on October 18, 1994, the soil was moist to 36 inches and dry below. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     Oi--0 to 1 inch; slightly decomposed forest litter.

     A--1 to 8 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) ashy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; many very fine, fine and medium irregular pores; 10 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); gradual smooth boundary. (7 to 10 inches thick) 

     Bw1--8 to 18 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) ashy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; many very fine, fine and medium irregular pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.3); clear smooth boundary.

     Bw2--18 to 25 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly ashy sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; many very fine, fine and medium irregular pores; 25 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick) 

     Bw3--25 to 37 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) very gravelly sandy loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; many very fine, fine and medium irregular pores; 50 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.1); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick) 

     C1--37 to 45 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) extremely gravelly sandy loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; many very fine, fine and medium irregular pores; 80 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.1); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick) 

     C2--45 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) extremely gravelly sandy loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; many very fine, fine and medium irregular pores; 70 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. The Bo series in a closely related family has less than 35 percent rock fragments.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Awley soils are on mountain slopes and ridges at elevations of 4,450 to 7,050 feet. These soils formed in colluvium from basalt and volcanic ash. Slopes range from 15 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is 28 to 36 inches. The average annual temperature is 36 to 39 degrees F. The frost-free period is 30 to 60 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bo soils. Bo soils are coarse-loamy and occur on similar geomorphic positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Awley soils are used mainly for timber production. Native vegetation is subalpine fir, Douglas-fir and mountain maple.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West-central Idaho. MLRA 43. Awley soils are not extensive.
