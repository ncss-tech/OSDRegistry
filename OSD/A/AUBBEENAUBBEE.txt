AUBBEENAUBBEE SERIES

The Aubbeenaubbee series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy glaciofluvium and the underlying loam till. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 11.1 degrees C (52 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Aeric Epiaqualfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Aubbeenaubbee fine sandy loam, on a nearly level convex slope of 1 percent in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated)

 Ap--0 to 20 cm (8 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; very friable; common fine roots; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. [15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 inches) thick]

[10 to 25 cm (4 to 10 inches) thick]

 BE--38 to 53 cm (15 to 21 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) fine sandy loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; thick continuous gray (10YR 6/1) sand coatings on faces of peds; many medium distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions and yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary.

[8 to 25 cm (3 to 10 inches) thick]

 2Bt--69 to 81 cm (27 to 32 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) clay loam; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots; medium continuous dark gray (10YR 4/1) organic coatings and clay films on faces of peds and as linings in channels; common medium faint brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) masses of oxidized iron and prominent light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) iron depletions; common medium distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4) and prominent black (10YR 2/1) iron-manganese masses; 2 percent fine gravel; neutral; clear wavy boundary.

 2Btg--81 to 102 cm (32 to 40 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; firm; thick continuous dark gray (10YR 4/1) organic coatings and clay films on faces of peds and as linings in channels; moderate medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) masses of oxidized iron; 5 percent fine gravel; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the 2Bt horizon is 25 to 76 cm (10 to 30 inches).]

 2C--102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) loam; massive; firm; many coarse distinct gray (10YR 6/1) iron depletions and yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; 10 percent fine gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Baugo, Crosier, Haskins, Lamberjack, and Shebeon series. Baugo soils contain less than 52 percent sand in the upper part of the series control section. Crosier and Shebeon soils are less than 102 cm (40 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Haskins soils have more than 27 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Lamberjack soils have more than 10 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Aubbeenaubbee soils are on moraines and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Aubbeenaubbee soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of glaciofluvium and in the underlying loam till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1016 mm (30 to 40 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.0 to 13.9 degrees C (50 to 57 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Metea, Owosso, Riddles, Wauseon, and Wawasee soils. The well drained Metea, Owosso, Riddles, and Wawasee soils are on ridges and backslopes. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Wauseon soils have a dark colored surface and are in depressions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Potential for surface runoff is very low to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high. Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the upper part of the solum and moderate or moderately slow in the lower part of the solum and in the underlying material.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. Corn and soybeans are the principal crops. Native vegetation is forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 97, 98, 110, 111B, and 111C in northern Indiana and southern Michigan. The series is of moderate extent.
