ATTEWAN SERIES 

The Attewan series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and glacial outwash that is 20 to 40 inches deep over very gravelly loamy sand or sand.  These soils are on outwash terraces, stream terraces, eskers, and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Attewan loam, cultivated.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

    Bk2--20 to 25 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; weak medium and coarse prismatic structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common fine roots; common fine pores; 10 percent pebbles; many medium masses of lime; continuous distinct lime coatings on pebbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary. (Combined Bk horizons 10 to 20 inches thick) 

    2C--25 to 60 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) very gravelly loamy sand; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; single grain; loose; nonsticky and nonplastic; about 60 percent pebbles; lime crusts on undersides of pebbles in upper part; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Beaverell, Evanston, and Tinsley soils.  The Beaverell and Tinsley soils are above and the Evanston soils are below the Attawan soils on the landscape.  Beaverell and Tinsley soils are less than 20 inches to sand and gravel and Evanston soils are deeper than 40 inches to sand and gravel.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Moderate permeability above the 2C horizon and rapid in the 2C horizon.  Runoff is negligible to medium depending on slope.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for irrigated and nonirrigated cropland and as rangeland.  The potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, needleandthread, western wheatgrass, forbs, and shrubs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Attewan soils are extensive throughout eastern Montana, some dry intermountain valleys, and in the states of Colorado and Utah.
