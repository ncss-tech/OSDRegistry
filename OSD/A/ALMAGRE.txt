MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Denver, Colorado.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Las Animas county, Colorado, Las Animas County Area soil survey area.  The name was taken from a prominent drainage in the area.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 9 to 30 inches (23 to 76 cm).  (Bt and Btk horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 9 inches (0 to 23 cm).  (A and BA horizons)
Argillic horizon:  The zone from 9 to 30 inches (23 to 76 cm).  (Bt and Btk horizons)
Calcic horizon:  The zone from 30 to 50 inches (76 to 127 cm).  (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)
Lithic contact:  The contact with sandstone at 50 inches (127 cm).  (R horizons)

This series was originally a bedrock substratum phase of the Wilid series.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
10/2008 LAN WAW updated the format to include metric and updated horizon nomenclature during final correlation of Las Animas County soil survey.
