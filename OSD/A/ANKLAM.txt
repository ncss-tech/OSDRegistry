ANKLAM SERIES

The Anklam series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium from metamorphic and igneous rock.  Anklam soils are on hills, mountains and pediments and have slopes of 5 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic, shallow Typic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Anklam very gravelly sandy loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 2 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly sandy loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine and few medium roots; many fine interstitial pores; 60 percent gravel; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (1/2 to 2 inches thick)

    Bt1--2 to 7 inches; reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) very gravelly clay loam, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; many very fine, common fine and few medium roots; common fine interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel; common faint clay films on faces of peds and coating gravel; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt2--7 to 13 inches; red (2.5YR 4/6) very gravelly clay loam, dark red (2.5YR 3/6) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many very fine, common fine and few medium roots; common fine interstitial pores; 50 percent fine and medium gravel; many distinct clay films on faces of peds and coating gravel; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear irregular boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

    2Crt--13 to 60 inches; partially weathered, fractured trachyandesite; few roots in fractures; common red (2.5YR 4/6) clay films and common calcium carbonate coatings in fractures.

TYPE LOCATION: Pima County, Arizona; part of the Tucson Mountains; in a cut along a gas pipeline; 1900 feet north and 1750 feet west of the southeast corner of section 28, T. 14 S., R. 13 E.  Latitude 32 degrees, 10 minutes, 59 seconds N., longitude 111 degrees, 1 minute, 2 seconds W., NAD 83.

Soil Temperature - 64 to 71 degrees F

Rock fragments - 35 to 90 percent

Depth to bedrock - 10 to 20 inches.  Some pedons have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches

Reaction - Neutral to moderately alkaline

A horizon
Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR
Value: 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 6 moist
Chroma: 2 through 6, dry or moist
Organic matter: 0.5 to 1 percent

Bt horizon
Hue: 2.5YR, 5YR
Value: 3 through 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 3 through 6, dry or moist
Texture: clay loam, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, sandy loam (averages 18 to 35 percent clay)
Calcium carbonate: noneffervescent to slightly effervescent

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Azure (AZ), Botleg (NV), and Straycow (NV) series. Azure, Botleg, and Straycow soils are in the Mohave Desert and are moist in some part of the soil moisture control section for less than 20 days cumulative between July and September.
 
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Anklam soils are on hills, mountains and pediments at elevations of 1,640 to 4,000 feet.  Slopes range from 5 to 50 percent.  The soils formed in slope alluvium from schist, andesite, latite and related tuff, granite, and agglomerate.  The mean annual air temperature is 62 to 70 degrees F.  Mean summer temperature is 80 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches and the frost-free period is 190 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cellar, Chimenea, Lajitas, Lehmans, Palos Verdes, Pantano, and Pinaleno series.  Pantano, Cellar, and Lajitas soils do not have argillic horizons.  Chimenea and Lehmans soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments.  Palos Verdes and Pinaleno soils are very deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for livestock grazing, homesites and recreation.  Vegetation is paloverde, Arizona cottontop, ocotillo, whitethorn, jojoba, bursage, brittlebush, janusia, saguaro, cholla, pricklypear, curlymesquite, threeawn, tobosa, calliandra, slender grama and bush muhly.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Arizona.  The Anklam series is moderately extensive. MLRA is 40.
