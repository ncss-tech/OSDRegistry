MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Burlington County, New Jersey, Pennsauken Creek Project, New Jersey, 1936.

REMARKS: The series description and classification was revised 6/97 to update horizon nomenclature and to add the cation-exchange activity class.  Further revisions to this series in 7/99 and 2/02 include restricting the drainage class to moderately well drained and weighted average of glauconite pellets to 10 to 20 percent within the mineralogy control section. Notes collected by MLRA staff and review of previously published soil surveys in New Jersey support these changes to the series. Adelphia soils in Burlington County and Monmouth County are described in the soil surveys as predominately moderately well drained. Additional minor changes to the range in characteristics were made to allow correlation of this soil within the MLRA soil survey updates.

Diagnostic horizons and other soil characteristics recognized in this 
pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 14 inches (Ap and BA horizons).
Argillic horizon--the zone from 14 to 30 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).
Aquic conditions--the zone from a depth of about 22 inches to 80 inches is periodically saturated (endosaturation).
