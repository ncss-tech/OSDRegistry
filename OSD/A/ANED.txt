ANED SERIES

The Aned series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and mixed lacustrine deposits. Aned soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 275 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Aned soils are on fan remnants at elevations of 1,750 to 1,900 meters. Slope gradients are 0 to 8 percent. Aned soils formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and mixed lacustrine deposits. The climate is cool continental, with a mean annual precipitation of 250 to 300 mm. The mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C and the frost free period is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Decan, Fanu, and Newvil soils. Decan soils average 35 to 45 percent clay the particle-size control section. Fanu soils are very deep and have a cambic horizon between 23 and 53 cm. Newvil soils average 18 to 27 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately slow permeability in the solum and very slow in the duripan; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The potential native vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, Stansbury's cliffrose, Nevada ephedra, blue grama, galleta, and needleandthread with a minor component of singleleaf pinyon and Utah juniper. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: East-central Nevada and southwestern Utah. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 29 and 28A.
