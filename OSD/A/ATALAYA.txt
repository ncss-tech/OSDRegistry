ATALAYA SERIES

The Atalaya series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and slope alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist over residuum derived from granite.  Atalaya soils are on beveled summits and shoulders of hills.  Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this family. The Antonchico series in a closely related family has a mollic epipedon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Atalaya soils are on beveled summits and shoulders of hills. They formed in alluvium and slope alluvium derived locally from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist over residuum of Precambrian granite or gneiss bedrock. Slopes are 5 to 15 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,400 to 8,500 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F. The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Arnor, Enmedio, and Setonville soils. Arnor soils are fine-loamy, do not have fragmental materials, and occur on toeslopes of hills. Enmedio soils are loamy skeletal over fragmental, have mollic epipedons, and occur on backslopes of hills. Setonville soils are loamy-skeletal over fragmental, have calcic horizons, and occur on footslopes of hills and knolls.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium surface runoff; permeability is moderately rapid in the surface and subsoil and very rapid in the lower substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: Atalaya soils are used for urban development, cord wood products, livestock grazing, and recreation. The historic climax vegetation is blue grama, Gamble's oak, twoneedle pinyon, and oneseed juniper.  The ecological site is Pinus edulis-Juniperus monosperma/Quercus gambeli/Bouteloua gracilis(F036XB134NM).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Atalaya soils are of small extent on the southwestern Sangre de Cristo part of the Southern Rocky Mountains province in northcentral New Mexico. The MLRA is 48A.
