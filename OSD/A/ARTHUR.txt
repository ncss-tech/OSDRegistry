ARTHUR SERIES

The Arthur series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of loess and underlying stratified sandy eolian material.  Arthur soils are on interfluves and side slopes on dissected till plains.  Slope ranges from 2 to 14 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 710 millimeters.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 28 centimeters (Ap and BA horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 28 to 102 centimeters (Bw1, Bw2, Bw3, 2BC horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange class is inferred from lab data for similar soils in the surrounding area.
