AUSTWELL SERIES

The Austwell series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in saline, calcareous, alluvial sediments high in smectitic clays .  These nearly level soils occur on flood plains on low coastal plains.  Slopes are less than 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (71 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, calcareous, hyperthermic Vertic Endoaquepts

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
These are the Aransas, Laewest, and Victoria series.
Aransas soils: have a mollic epipedon;on similar landform.
Laewest and Victoria soils: are better drained;  on a higher non-flooded landform

REMARKS: Classification changed from Typic Haplaquepts to Vertic Endoaquepts 11/2000 based on typifying pedon description.  Some limited data indicate these soils may be Vertisols.  Further study and characterization data of the series is needed to verify hydrology and classification.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in) (A horizon).
Cambic horizon: 20 to 107 cm (8 to 42 in) (Bnzg1 and Bnzg2)
