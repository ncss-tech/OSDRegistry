ANOWELL SERIES

The Anowell series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuff, shale, chert and quartzite. The Anowell soils are on crests and side slopes of hills.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Xeric Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Anowell gravelly loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is partially covered with 50 percent gravel.

     A--0 to 5 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak thin and medium platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine interstitial and tubular pores; 25 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (3 to 13 cm thick)

     Btk--5 to 15 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) gravelly clay loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; 20 percent rock structure; slightly hard, very friable, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine interstitial and few fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films lining pores and on faces of ped; 15 percent gravel; thin carbonate coats on undersides of gravel; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (8 to 20 cm thick)

     Cr--15 to 25 cm; soft, fractured, platy tuffaceous sediments; few very fine, fine and medium roots along fractures; strongly effervescent.

TYPE LOCATION: Elko County, Nevada; approximately 5 miles northwest of Montello near Toano Draw, about 375 feet west and 1,750 feet south of the northeast corner, sec. 6, T. 40 N., R. 67 E.; USGS Ninemile Mountain 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 41 degrees 22 minutes 41 seconds N and longitude 114 degrees 25 minutes 58 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 41.3780556 latitude, -114.4327778 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in the winter and spring, dry from mid-June through October; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
 Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C.
Depth to paralithic contact: 13 to 30 cm.
Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 20 to 35 percent.
Rock fragments: 10 to 30 percent, mainly gravel.

A horizon
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y.
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3.
Effervescence: Slightly effervescent or strongly effervescent.

Btk horizons
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y.
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 3 or 4.
Texture: Clay loam, gravelly loam or gravelly clay loam.
Clay content: 25 to 35 percent.
Rock fragments: 10 to 30 percent, mainly gravel.
Structure: Weak or moderate subangular blocky or angular blocky.
Carbonates: 1 to 5 percent calcium carbonates equivalents.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Chill, Corral, Genaw and Yuko series. 

Chill soils have 45 to 65 percent sand in the particle-size control section.  Corral and Genaw soils are deeper than 30 cm.  Yuko soils are slightly acid to slightly alkaline.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Anowell soils are on crests and side slopes of hills and fan piedmonts with a rock core. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuff, shale, chert and quartzite. Slopes are 4 to 30 percent. Elevations are 1,590 to 1,925 meters. The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, most winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chiara, Dacker and Peeko soils. Chiara and Peeko soils are shallow to a duripan. Dacker soils are moderately deep to a duripan.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained, medium or rapid runoff, moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly black sagebrush, green rabbitbrush, phlox, bluebunch wheatgrass and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeast Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 25.
