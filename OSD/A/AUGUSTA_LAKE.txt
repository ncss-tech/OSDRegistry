AUGUSTA LAKE SERIES

The Augusta Lake series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in 100 to 150 centimeters of eolian sediments and loamy sediments and in the underlying till. These soils are on summits and backslopes on ground moraines and till plains and on terraces and outwash plains adjacent to moraines and till plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 12 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.  The mean annual precipitation is about 735 millimeters.

REMARKS: 
Particle-size control section--the zone from depth of 25 to 100 centimeters (Ap, AB, Bw1, Bw2, and Bw3 horizons;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (Ap, AB, Bw1, Bw2, Bw3, and 2Bk horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 38 centimeters (Ap and AB horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 38 to 117 centimeters (Bw1, Bw2 and Bw3 horizons);
calcic horizon--the zone from a depth of 117 to 168 centimeters (2Bk horizon);
udic moisture regime.

This soil was formerly included with the Dickman and Grogan soils in Cottonwood County, Minnesota.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
