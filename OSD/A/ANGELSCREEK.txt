ANGELSCREEK SERIES

The Angelscreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and/or residuum derived from agglomerate, tuff breccia, or latite. The Angelscreek soils are on lahars and sideslopes of lava plateaus. Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 765 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Angelscreek soils are on lahars and sideslopes of lava plateaus. Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and/or residuum derived from agglomerate, tuff breccia (andesitic), or latite. Elevation is 150 to 800 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 520 to 960 mm.The mean annual air temperature is 15 to 17 degrees C. The frost free season is 230 to 330 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Inks, Pentz, Shawsflat, Goldwall, and Toomes soils. The Inks soils are shallow to a lithic contact and are typically on summit or shoulder positions. Pentz soils have less than 35 percent fragments in the control section and are shallow to a paralithic contact. Shawsflat soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact and lack an argillic horizon. Goldwall and Toomes are on the summits of lava plateaus and are very shallow and shallow respectively.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately high to high saturated hydraulic conductivity in the epipedon and moderately low to high saturated hydraulic conductivity in the control section.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, homesite development and viticulture. Vegetation consists mainly of hardwood species with grasses and forbs in the understory. Tree species include blue oak, live oak, foothill pine, and buckeye. Understory species include brome, ryegrass, wild oat, geranium, soft chess, and fescue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Foothills in California; MLRA 18. The series is not extensive.
