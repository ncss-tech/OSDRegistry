ANTONCHICO SERIES

The Antonchico series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist over residuum derived from schist.  Antonchico soils are on beveled summits of hills and knolls.  Slopes are 3 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this family. The Setonville series in a closely related family does not have a mollic epipedon and has mixed mineralogy.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Antonchico soils are on beveled summits of hills and knolls. They formed in alluvium derived locally from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist over residuum of Precambrian schist bedrock. Slopes are 3 to 5 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,300 to 8,200 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F. The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Arnor, Atalaya, Enmedio and Setonville soils. Arnor soils are fine-loamy, do not have calcic horizons and fragmental materials, and occur on toeslopes of hills. Atalaya soils are coarse-loamy over fragmental, do not have calcic horizons, and occur on beveled summits. Enmedio soils are loamy-skeletal over fragmental, do not have mollic epipedons or calcic horizons, and occur on backslopes of hills. Setonville soils are loamy-skeletal over fragmental, do not have mollic epipedons, and occur on adjacent footslopes of hill and knolls.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium surface runoff; permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION: Antonchico soils are used for urban development, cord wood products, livestock grazing, and recreation. The historic climax vegetation is ponderosa pine, Gambel's oak, mountain muhly, and muttongrass.  The ecological site is Pinus ponderosa/Quercus gambleii (F048AY010NM). 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Antonchico soils are of small extent on the southwestern Sangre de Cristo part of the Southern Rocky Mountains province in northcentral New Mexico. The MLRA is 48A.

Calcic horizon - The zone from 20 to about 42 inches. (2BCk horizon)
Fragmental feature -from 20 to about 42 inches. (2BCk horizon)
Lithic contact - The presence of indurated schist bedrock at 42 inches. (2R layer)
Particle-size control section - The zone from 2 to 40 inches. (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and 2BCk  horizons

Taxonomic version: Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Calcium carbonate equivalence was determined using a calcimeter.

The mineralogy class was changed from paramicaceous to micaceous in 07/2010 by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the responsible MLRA regional office.  The change was necessary based on the eleventh edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2010.
