The Arbuckle series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. Arbuckle soils are on low terraces, and have slopes of 0 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 508 millimeters (20 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Arbuckle soils are on low terraces at elevations of 9 to 610 meters ( 30 to 2,000 feet) and have slopes of 0 to 75 percent. The parent material is alluvium derived from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. Rock fragments are dominantly quartz and chert.. The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 89 centimeters (10 to 35 inches). Mean annual air temperature is 14 to 18 degrees C (57 to 64 degrees F.), average January temperature about 7 degrees C (45 degrees F.), and average July temperature about 28 degrees C (83 degrees F.) Frost-free season ranges from 152 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Esparto soils and the Garretson, Haire, Hillgate, Tehama, Wyo, Yolo and Zamora soils. Garretson and Yolo soils lack Bt horizons. Haire and Hillgate soils have Bt horizons with more than 35 percent clay. Tehama soils have fine-silty textural control sections with 11 to 15 percent fine sand and coarser. Wyo and Zamora soils have Bt horizons with moist values of less than 4.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; negligible to high runoff; moderately slow to slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for dryland and irrigated orchards, irrigated row and field crops, dryfarmed grain, and for range. Natural vegetation is annual grasses and forbs, either alone or as an understory with blue oaks in stands ranging from open to dense.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Along the west side of the Sacramento Valley and the intermountain valleys of the Coast Range and valleys of Southern California. The series is extensive. MLRA 17, 14, 15, 19, 20.
