ASPERMONT SERIES

The Aspermont series consists of deep, well drained, moderately slow or moderately permeable soils.  These soils formed in calcareous silty colluvium over redbed siltstone and claystone of Permian age.  These very gently sloping to steep soils occur on interfluves and sideslopes of hillslopes on dissected plains.  Slope ranges from 1 to 25 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 16.7 degrees C (62 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm (25 in).
