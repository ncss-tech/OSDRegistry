ALTO SERIES

The Alto series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in marine sediments high in glauconite material of the Weches Formation. These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on toeslopes and in depressional saddles on interfluves on the Coastal Plain. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1092 cm (43 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C (67 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, siliceous, active, thermic Typic Hapludalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON: Alto fine sandy loam, 2 percent slope in pastureland. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Bt1--20 to 46 cm (8 to 18 in); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay loam, same color dry; many medium prominent mottles of red (2.5YR 4/6); moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm; clay films on faces of most peds; about 10 percent by volume fine concretions of iron; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary. 

    Bt2--46 to 81 cm (18 to 32 in); yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) clay prominently and coarsely mottled with 40 percent red (2.5YR 4/6); moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm; clay films on most peds; about 10 percent of fine concretions of iron; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

(Combined Bt horizons 76 to 152 cm [30 to more than 60 in] thick). 

    Cd--173 to 203 cm (68 to 80 in); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) claystone and weathered glauconitic sandstone, noncemented bedrock; massive; very hard; contains many small fragments of glauconitic greensand; moderately acid.
