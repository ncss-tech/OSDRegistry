ADAMSON SERIES



The Adamson series consists of very deep, well drained soils that

formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Adamson soils are on stream

terraces and have slopes of 0 to 4 percent.  Permeability is moderate

to 28 inches and very rapid below.  The average annual precipitation is

about 14 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 42

degrees F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Pachic Haploxerolls

frigid Calcic Pachic Haploxerolls.



TYPICAL PEDON:  Adamson loam - on a 1 percent slope at an elevation of

5,020 feet in rangeland.  When described on August 17, 1971, the soil

was dry to 28 inches and moist below.  (Colors are for dry soil unless

otherwise noted.)



    A--0 to 5 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish

brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and medium granular structure;

slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine

roots; many very fine interstitial pores; neutral (pH 6.6); clear

smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)



    BA--5 to 19 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) loam, very dark

grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky

structure; slightly hard, friable; many fine roots; common very fine

interstitial pores; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 14

inches thick)



    Bw--19 to 28 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, very

dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable; many

fine and medium roots; about 5 percent pebbles; mildly alkaline (pH

7.6); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 12 inches thick)



    2Bk--28 to 61 inches; light grayish brown (10YR 6/2) very gravelly

coarse sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; single grain; loose,

few fine roots; about 40 percent pebbles and 20 percent cobbles; slight

effervescence (calcium carbonate accumulation on underside of rock

fragments) mildly alkaline (pH 7.8).



TYPE LOCATION:  Blaine County, Idaho; about 3 miles south and 1 mile

west of Bellevue; 800 feet west and 125 feet south of the northeast

corner of sec. 23, T. 1 N., R. 18 E.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other soils recognized in this family.

The Balaam series are in a similar family.  The Balaam soils have

thinner mollic epipedons and are in a sandy-skeletal family.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Adamson soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes

range from 0 to 4 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,700 to 6,000 feet.

The soil formed in recent alluvium.  The annual precipitation is 14 to

18 inches, most of which falls as snow and early spring rain.  The

average annual air temperature is about 40 degrees to 45 degrees F.

The frost-free season is 60 to 90 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Balaam, Bruneel, Carey

Lake, Hutton, and Little Wood soils.  Little Wood soils have more than

35 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Bruneel and Hutton

soils have Aquic moisture regimes.  Carey Lake soils have argillic

horizons.  Carey Lake and Little Wood soils occur on older alluvial

fans and fan terraces.  Bruneel and Hutton soils occur on recent

floodplains.  Balaam soils occur on the same landscape position.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability.

Subject to rare or occasional flooding in the spring.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for irrigated pasture, hay and small

grain and some rangeland.  Vegetation is basin big sagebrush, bluebunch

wheatgrass, mountain big sagebrush, Idaho fescue, slender wheatgrass,

and Sandberg bluegrass.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Adamson soils are inextensive in southcentral

Idaho.
