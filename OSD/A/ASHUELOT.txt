ASHUELOT SERIES

The Ashuelot series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in alluvium or colluvium. These soils are on fan remnants, alluvial fans, and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, carbonatic, frigid, shallow Petrocalcic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Ashuelot gravelly loam, native grass (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 13 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; 20 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 18 cm thick)

    ABk--13 to 33 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong coarse angular blocky structure parting to moderate medium angular blocky; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many very fine pores; finely disseminated carbonates and many prominent carbonate coats on rock fragments; 10 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 20 cm thick)

    Bk--33 to 46 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many very fine pores; many medium and coarse calcium carbonate masses in the matrix; 10 percent gravel, some weakly cemented with carbonates; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (10 to 20 cm thick)

    Bkkm--46 to 58 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) and light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; calcium carbonate cemented sand and gravel; extremely hard; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 20 cm thick)

    BCk--58 to 96 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely gravelly loamy sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; single grain; nonsticky and nonplastic; finely disseminated carbonates and many thick carbonate coats on rock fragments; 60 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4). (0 to 40 cm thick)

    C--96 to 152 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely gravelly loamy sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; single grain; nonsticky and nonplastic; 60 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).
