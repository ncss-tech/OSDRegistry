TYPE LOCATION: Klamath County, Oregon; about 13 km southwest of Klamath Falls, 640 m south and 210 m west of the NE corner of sec. 9, T. 40 S., R. 8E., Willamette Meridian; Hamaker Mountain, Oregon USGS 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 42.1058010 degrees north, longitude 121.8769990 degrees west, datum WGS84 (coordinates derived from topographic map legal description)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Mean annual soil temperature--8 to 11 degrees C
Moisture control section--30 to 90 cm; wet throughout in most months unless drained
Thickness of mollic epipedon--18 to 40 cm
Depth to lithologic discontinuity--50 to 100 cm
Depth to aquic conditions--0 to 25 cm
Depth to redoximorphic features--20 to 40 cm
Depth to high water table--0 to 25 cm

Some part of the mollic epipedon has more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium, decreasing at depths below 50 cm. It has an estimated 1/3-bar bulk density of 0.4 to 0.7 g/cm3.

The zone between 25 and 50 cm is calcareous in all parts.

The silty upper part (A and Cg horizons) of the soil has an exchange complex dominated by amorphous material.
