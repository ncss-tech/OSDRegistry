AVANS SERIES 

The Avans series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium on paleo-terraces in river valleys of the Great Bend Sand Plains (MLRA 79). Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 29 inches (74 centimeters). Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F (13 degrees C).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Geary (KS) and Holder (NE) soils. Geary and Holder soils are formed in loess and occur higher on the landscape. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Avans soils

Parent material: loamy alluvium
Landform: paleo-terraces
Slopes: 0 to 8 percent
Elevation: 1200 to 1600 feet (365.8 to 487.7 meters)
Mean annual air temperature: 55 to 57 degrees F (13 to 14 degrees C).
Mean annual precipitation: 28 to 32 inches (71 to 81 centimeters)
Wettest months: Mar. - Oct.
Driest months: Nov. - Feb.
Frost-free period: 187 to 225 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Clark, Ost, Penalosa and Taver series. Clark soils sit lower on the paleo-terrace, and do not contain an argillic horizon. Ost soils also sit lower on the paleo-terrace and contain more carbonates at shallower depths than Avans soils. Penalosa and Taver soils are fine textured and sit higher on the paleo-terrace on broad flats.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage: well drained. 
Runoff: low to medium 
Permeability: moderate. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly cultivated to alfalfa, grain sorghum, and small grains. Native vegetation was tall grasses. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South Central Kansas. LRR H Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range, MLRA 79 Great Bend Sand Plains. The series is of moderate extent.
