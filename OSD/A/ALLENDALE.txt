ALLENDALE SERIES

The Allendale series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in sandy sediments and in the underlying clayey lacustrine deposits or till on lake basins, lake terraces, lake plains, outwash plains, and ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).

Some pedons have a thin layer that is sandy loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam, which is just above the 2Bt horizon.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Fibre series. The Fibre soils are saturated for longer periods and at a shallower depth in the upper part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Allendale soils are on lake basins, lake terraces, lake plains, outwash plains, and ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 864 mm (27 to 34 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 5.0 to 8.3 degrees C (41 to 47 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Au Gres, Bergland, Croswell, Kalkaska, Kellogg, Manistee, Melita, Pickford, Pinconning, Rubicon, Rudyard, and Selkirk soils. The well drained Manistee, the moderately well drained Kellogg, and the poorly drained or very poorly drained Fibre and Pinconning soils form a drainage sequence with Allendale. The somewhat excessively drained Kalkaska and Melita, the excessively drained Rubicon, the moderately well drained Croswell, and the somewhat poorly drained Au Gres are sandy soils associated with the Allendale soils. The somewhat poorly drained Selkirk and Rudyard soils and the poorly drained Pickford and Bergland soils are clayey soils that are in association with Allendale soils in some areas.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 61 cm (0.5 to 2 feet) during October, November, March, April, May, and June in normal years. The water tends to perch at the interface between the sandy and clayey materials. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to very low, dependent on slope. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the sandy part and moderately low or low in the clayey part. Permeability is rapid in the sandy upper part and slow or very slow in the clayey lower part.

USE AND VEGETATION: Cleared areas are used for the production of small grains, alfalfa-grass hay, and corn with some soybeans and field beans. Some areas are in permanent pasture or in woodland. Natural forest vegetation consists of quaking aspen, balsam fir, paper birch, red maple, eastern white pine, white ash, and white spruce.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 90A, 92, 93A, 93B, 94A, 94B, 94C, 95A, 96, 98, and 99 in the northern half of the Lower Peninsula and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, northwestern Wisconsin, and northern Minnesota. This series is of moderate extent.
