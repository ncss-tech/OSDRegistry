ABERNATHY SERIES

The Abernathy series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils. These soils formed in weakly developed local alluvium over residuum weathered from limestone or old alluvium. They are in intermittent drainageways. Mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 58 inches. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.

REMARKS: The Abernathy series is being reactivated with this revision.  Some Abernathy map units had been previously recorrelated to the Emory series.  Field work and water table data loggers revealed Abernathy soils differ from Emory soils by having a seasonal water table above 100 cm through much of January, February, and March.  Although associated with karst landscapes, Abernathy soils do not have as extensive underground drainage by solution sinkholes as do Emory soils.  

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 inches) (Ap horizon)
Cambic horizon--the zone from 18 to 41 cm (7 to 16 inches) (Bw horizon)
Buried A horizon--the zone from 41 to 89 cm (16 to 35 inches) (2Ab horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 89 to 165 cm (35 to 65 inches) (2Btb horizon)
Fragipan--the zone from 165 to 203 cm (65 to 80 inches) (2Btxb horizon)

Characterization samples for the typifying pedon and three additional pedons are being analyzed by Auburn University. The pedon numbers are S04AL-089-002, S04AL-083-001, S03AL-083-004, S04TN-051-002
