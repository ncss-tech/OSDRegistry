ARDTOO SERIES

The Ardtoo series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from granite, gneiss, or schist, with an influence of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. These soils are on mountains. Slopes are 3 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Vitrandic Haploxerepts

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Analulu, Ardenvoir, Blackprince, Blinn, Brevco, Coxit, Daxty, Easte, Highhorn, Huntrock, Jimbluff, Jumpe, Kamela, Lekrem, Lemoncreek, Longort, Minaloosa, Noil,Ontrail, Radercreek, Redpeak, Santop, Seeburg, Thout, Threecabin and Warfield series. Analulu, Blinn Brevco, Daxty, Huntrock, Kamela, Lemoncreek, Redpeak, Santop and Thout soils are all moderately deep to a lithic contact. Blackprince soils are moderately deep to granite, gneiss or schist.   Ardenvoir soils have C horizons with loam, silt loam or sandy loam textures and have a paralithic contact to metasedimentary bedrock. Coxit, Jimbluff, Jumpe, Lekrem, Minaloosa, Ontrail, and Seeburg soils are very deep. Easte soils have an umbric epipedon and are dry for more than 90 consecutive days. Highhorn soils have 2Bwb horizons, have silty clay loam textures in the subsoil, and have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Longort soils are moderately deep to densic material. Noil soils have 2 to 4 percent mica flakes throughout and have greater than 50 percent fine sand or coarser in the particle-size control section. Radercreek, Threecabin, and Warfield soils are deep to a lithic contact. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ardtoo soils are on mountain side slopes at elevations of 2,000 to 5,000 feet. Slopes are 3 to 65 percent. These soils occupy all aspects at lower elevations, but mainly southerly aspects at higher elevations. They formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from granite, gneiss or schist, with an influence of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. The mean annual air temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 25 to 38 inches. The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dufort, Kruse, Lenz, Melder, and Vay soils. Dufort soils are ashy over loamy-skeletal and are on foothills and mountains. Kruse soils have argillic horizons, less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section and are on mountains, canyon sides, ridges and hills. Lenz soils have mesic soil temperature and mollic epipedons and are on mountains and foothill side slopes. Melder soils have argillic horizons and are on mountains. Vay soils are medial over loamy-skeletal, have a cryic soil temperature and are on mountains and ridgetops. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well-drained. Runoff is rapid or very rapid. Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the upper part of the solum and moderately rapid in the lower part. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, grazing, wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed. Potential natural vegetation is mainly grand fir, Douglas-fir, western larch, and ponderosa pine with an understory of myrtle pachystima, creambush oceanspray, mallow ninebark, common snowberry, spirea, baldhip rose, willow, redstem ceanothus, and pinegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Idaho and eastern Washington; MLRA 43A. This soil is moderately extensive.
