ATIRAS SERIES

The Atiras series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils.  These soils formed in sandy eolian deposits of Holocene age over loamy Quaternary alluvium.  These soils are on gently undulating eolian plains associated with vegetated longitudinal dunes on the Sandsheet Prairie of the South Texas Coastal Plain.  Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 23 degrees C (73 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm (26 in).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Kenedy County, Texas, 2007.  The name is coined.

REMARKS:  The series was formerly included in the Sarita series.  The series was separated based on the presence of the buried A horizons and difference in drainage class.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle size control section: 155 to 203 cm (61 to 80 in) (Btb1, Btb2 and Btb3 horizons)
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 43 cm (0 to 17 in) (A horizons)
Cambic horizon: 155 to 203 cm (61 to 80 in) (Bwb1, Bwb2 and Bwb3 horizons)
Redoximorphic concentrations: 41 to 203 cm (16 to 80 in)
Lithologic discontinuity: 147 to 203 cm (58 to 80 in)
The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by lab sample number S98TX-261-005 from Kenedy County, Texas.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  TAMU data from Kenedy County, TX (S98TX-261-005)
