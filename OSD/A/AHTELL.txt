Some pedons have a silt loam A horizon forming some, or all, of the umbric epipedon rather than a B horizon. 
On steeper slopes, a buried A horizons may also be present within or beneath the umbric epipedon

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Archabal (ID), Domo (CO), Nickolna (AK), and Packtrail (CO) soils
Archabal, Domo and Packtrail lack a folistic epipedon and presumably have a mean annual air temperature above 0 C (32 F).
Packtrail soils have bedrock between 51 and 102 cm (20 and 40 in)
Nikolna lack a folistic epipedon, and have fine-loamy textures in the umbric horizon. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Elevation: 600 to 1200 meters (1970 to 3935 ft)
Parent material: Organic material over till
Landform: mountain slopes and till plains
Slopes: 2 to 25 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 330 to 800 mm (13 to 31 in)
Mean annual air temperature: -4 to -2 degrees C. (25 to 28 degrees F)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Chelina, Fields, Haleycreek, Nathlie, and Summitlake soils.
Chelina soils lack an umbric epipedon, have a cambic horizon, and occur on the ancient shorelines of lake plains.
Fields soils lack a folistic epipedon, have a coarse-loamy particle size family class and occur on hillslopes and mountain slopes. 
Haleycreek soils have a mollic epipedon, sandy-skeletal particle size family class, and occur in mountain valleys 
Nathlie soils have a histic epipedon and aquic conditions in the top 50 cm (20 in), they occur on flood plains.
Summitlake soils lack an umbric epipedon, have redox concentrations and depletions within 12 cm (5 in) of the surface, and occur on drumlins and hillslopes on glacial valley floors.
