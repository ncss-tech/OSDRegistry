ATKINSON SERIES

The Atkinson series consists of deep or very deep, well drained soils formed in 100 to 150 centimeters of loamy sediments with or without a thin paleosol over limestone bedrock. These soils are on ridges of narrow interfluves, crests and side slopes on uplands, high structural benches, and strath terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 14 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 735 millimeters.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Bremer County, Iowa, 1965

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 48 to 98 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 127 centimeters (Ap, A, BA, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and 2Bt4 horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 48 centimeters (Ap, A, and BA horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 48 to 127 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and 2Bt4 horizons);
lithic contact--the contact with limestone bedrock at 127 centimeters;
udic moisture regime.

The upper 0.3 to 1.5 meters of limestone may be significantly fractured and may not be a root restrictive layer.  Fractures may be filled with loamy material.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
