ALINE SERIES

The Aline series consists of very deep, somewhat excessive drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in material weathered from sandy eolian deposits of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level to strongly sloping soils are on undulating to rolling sandy deposits on terraces in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A).  Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 787 mm (31 in), and mean annual temperature is 15.6 degrees C (60 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, thermic Psammentic Paleustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Aline fine sand-rangeland at an elevation of 381 m (1250 ft) (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A--0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in); brown (10YR 5/3) fine sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; many fine roots; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. [Thickness of the A horizon is 8 to 46 cm [7 to 18 in])

     E--20 to 86 cm (8 to 34 in); light brown (7.5YR 6/4) fine sand; brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; single grained; loose; many fine roots; slightly acid; slightly effervescent to strongly effervescent; clear wavy boundary.  [Thickness of the E horizon is 0 to 91 cm ([8 to 36 in])

     E and Bt--86 to 183 cm (34 to 72 in); alternating layers of light brown (7.5YR 6/4) fine sand E material 1/2 inch to 5 inches thick and reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) loamy fine sand Bt material 1/4 inch to 3 inches thick; fine sand is single grained; loose, has many uncoated sand grains; loamy fine sand has weak subangular blocky structure; is slightly hard; friable, wavy and discontinuous; the sand grains are bridged and coated; slightly acid; slightly to strongly effervescent.

TYPE LOCATION:  Alfalfa County, Oklahoma; about 9 miles east and 3 miles north of Cherokee; 950 feet east and 300 feet south of the northwest corner of sec. 22, T. 27 N., R. 9 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Solum thickness: is more than 152 cm (60 in)  
Combined thickness of the A and E horizons: 50 to 127 cm (20 to 50 in)

A horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 5 to 7, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4, 3 to 6 moist
Texture: sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand
Effervescence: none to strong 
Reaction: neutral to moderately acid 

E horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 6 to 8, or 5 to 7 moist
Chroma: 2 to 6, or 4 to 8 moist 
Effervescence: none to slight 
Reaction: neutral to moderately acid 

Bt horizon: 
Hue: 2.5YR or 7.5YR
Value: 6 or 7, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 4 to 6, 4 or 6 moist
Texture: loamy fine sand or fine sandy loam, but the control section averages loamy fine sand
Other features (Bt): occurs as lamellae or less commonly it is continuous horizontally and vertically in the upper 20 cm (8 in).  Where present, the continuous Bt horizon is loamy fine sand.  
Redox concentrations: high chromas above 150 cm (60 in) 
Redoximorphic depletions: chroma of 1 or 2 are at depths ranging from 150 to 225 cm (60 to 90 in)
Effervescence: none to slight
Reaction: moderately acid to moderately alkaline

C horizon (where present):
Texture: fine sand or loamy fine sand 
Lithologic discontinuities: in some pedons below the solum that are very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam

COMPETING SERIES:  These are Goltry series in the same family and Bienville, Dougherty, Eufaula, Likes, Nobscot, Pratt, Stidham, and Tivoli series of similar families. 
Bienville soils: have siliceous mineralogy and occur in wetter areas  Dougherty and Stidham soils: have a loamy control section  
Eufaula soils: have siliceous mineralogy
Goltry soils: have wetness features (redox features) 75 to 150 cm (30 to 60 in) below the surface, have a water table mainly between 75 to 150 cm (30 to 60 in) in wet seasons, and 150 to 200 cm (60 to 80 in) during dry seasons 
Likes and Tivoli soils: do not have an argillic horizon 
Nobscot soils: have an argillic horizon that is fine sandy loam 
Pratt soils: have an A horizon less than 50 cm (20 in) thick and a solum less than 150 cm (60 in) thick

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: formed in material weathered from sandy eolian deposits of Pleistocene age
Landscape: dunes on terraces 
Landform: nearly level to strongly sloping soils are on undulating to rolling deposits on terraces   
Mean annual temperature: 13.9 to 16.7 degrees C (57 to 62 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 660 to 914 mm (26 to 37 inches)
Frost-free days: 190 to 230  
Elevation: 213 to 457 m (700 to 1500 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the competing Goltry, and Tivoli series. 
Goltry soils: are in lower positions
Tivoli soils: are in high positions closer to the river

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  
Drainage: somewhat excessive 
Permeability: rapid 
Runoff: negligible on 0 to 5 percent slopes, and very low on 5 to 12 percent slopes 
Seasonal water table: is typically below 2.1 m (7 ft), but ranges from 1.8 to 3 m (6 to about 10 ft)

USE AND VEGETATION:  Largely used for grazing.  The vegetation is mainly tall and mid grass prairie.  Minor acreage is cultivated with grain sorghum and small grains being the main crops.
