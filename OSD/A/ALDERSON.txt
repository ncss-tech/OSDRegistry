ALDERSON SERIES

The Alderson series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils on uplands.  These gently sloping to strongly sloping soils are forming in loamy oxidized overburden spoil placed by cross-pit spreaders during lignite surface mining operations.  Slope ranges from 1 to 12 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 66 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 39 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, nonacid, thermic Udic Ustorthents

TYPE LOCATION:  Freestone County, Texas; on TUMCO Big Brown Mine about 8 miles northeast of Fairfield;  Latitude: 31 degrees, 50 minutes, 16.4 seconds N; Longitude: 96 degree, 5 minutes, 34 seconds W.  Young USGS topographic quadrangle; NAD 1927.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture: An ustic soil moisture regime bordering on udic.  The soil moisture control section is dry in some or all parts more than 90 but less than 150 cumulative days in normal years.  June through August and December through March are the driest months.  These soils are intermittently moist in September through October and April through May.

Mean annual soil temperature at 50 cm:  66 to 70 degrees F.
Particle-size control section (weighted average)
Clay content:  20 to 35 percent
Silt content:  20 to 40 percent.
Coarse parafragments:  5 to 35 percent
CEC/clay ratio:  0.60 to 0.80

A Horizon
Hue: 10YR
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam or their paragravelly counterparts.
Clay content: 20 to 35 percent
Paragravel fragments: 0 to 10 percent
Reaction: moderately acid to slightly alkaline

Bw/C or C Horizon
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 5 to 7
Chroma: 3 to 4
Texture: loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or their paragravelly counterparts.
Clay content: 20 to 35 percent
Paragravel fragments: 5 to 30 percent
Reaction: strongly acid to neutral

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Hammond series and the similar Bigbrown, Gibbonscreek, Diswood, and Marclay series.
Hammond series: have a surface of reclaimed topsoil with mollic colors
Bigbrown series: fine-silty particle-size control section.
Gibbonscreek series: slightly drier in the moisture control section and formed in sediments of the Jackson Group geological formations which typically contain higher amounts of exchangeable sodium.
Diswood and Marclay series: udic soil moisture regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: recent oxidized mining spoil derived from Tertiary age sediments, mainly of the Wilcox Formation.
Landform: anthropogenic fill by crosspit spreader that deposits materials in a somewhat uniform mixture from surface mine operations on uplands.
Slope: 1 to 12 percent
Mean annual temperature: 64 to 70 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 32 to 40 inches.
Precipitation Pattern:  Somewhat uniform throughout the year with April, May, September, and October the wettest months.
Frost-free period: 240 to 270 days.
Elevation: 300 to 550 feet.
Thornthwaite annual P-E indices: 54 to 64.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Bigbrown series.  Soils in adjacent pre-mined areas are Axtell, Crockett, Gasil, Edge, Lufkin, Padina, Rader, and Silstid series.
Bigbrown soils: fine-silty particle-size control section.
Axtell, Crockett, Gasil, Edge, Lufkin, Padina, Rader, and Silstid soils: these soils have an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Slow permeability.  Runoff is high on 1 to 5 percent slopes, and very high on 5 to 12 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly improved pasture of coastal bermudagrass, common bermudagrass and arrowleaf clover.  Some areas are established with shrubs, native grasses, and hardwood trees for wildlife habitat.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East Central Texas in lignite coal mining areas; LRR J; MLRA 87A.  The series is minor in extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Temple, Texas

SERIES PROPOSED:  Freestone County, Texas, 2000.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle size control section: 10 to 40 inches.  (Bw or C horizons)
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 10 inches.  (A horizons) 

Additional Comments: These soils are forming a weak structural Bw horizon in some pedons, however this horizon does not qualify for a cambic horizon.  These soils have been reclaimed beginning in 1986.
