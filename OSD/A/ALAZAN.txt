ALAZAN SERIES

The Alazan series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvial or marine sediments. These nearly level soils are on Pleistocene terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation range is about 1016 to 1397 mm (40 to 55 in) and the mean annual soil temperature is about 19 to 21 degrees C (67 to 70 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Bernaldo series, and the Attoyac, Besner, Gallime, and Mollville series.
Bernaldo and Gallime soils:   are on slightly higher terrace positions, are well drained and do not have a glossic horizon.
Attoyac soils:   have a reddish subsoil, and are on slightly higher positions or on side slopes below areas of Alazan soils.
Besner soils:   have a coarse-loamy control section and are on slightly higher positions, typically on mounds.
Mollville soils:   are on lower, wetter depressions and are poorly drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. Permeability is moderate. Runoff is very low. An apparent water table is at a depth of 46 to 76 cm  (18 to 30 in) during the winter and spring seasons for long to very long durations. The water table is present for a cumulative period of 1 to 3 months during normal years.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for timber with some areas of improved pasture. A few areas have been cleared and are used for cropland or pasture. Native vegetation is loblolly and shortleaf pine with mixed hardwoods. The understory is dogwood, waxmyrtle, longleaf uniola, pinehill bluestem, and other grasses. Improved pastures include bermudagrass and bahiagrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Texas and Louisiana. The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Angelina County, Texas; 1984.

REMARKS: The series was updated in 2002 to allow a Bt horizon to occur in some pedons above the glossic horizon. The series was updated in 2004 to add fine sandy loam texture to the range in characteristics for the A and E horizons, allow value 5 in the range in characteristics for the E horizon, allow none to few quartzite pebbles in the epipedon in some pedons, allow clay loam texture in the Glossic horizon, allow the Bt/E horizon to range up to slightly acid, and allow the Btg/E horizon to range down to very strongly acid.

This soil was formerly included in the Caddo or Thage series. 
Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include: 
Ochric epipedon ---- 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in).   (A and E horizons)
Argillic horizon---- 25 to 203 cm (10 to 80 in).  (Bt/E horizons)
Glossic horizon ---- 25 to 203 cm (10 to 80 in).   (Bt/E horizons)
Aquic conditions --- 46 to 76 cm (18 to 30 in).   (Bt/E1 horizon).
