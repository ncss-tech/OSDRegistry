ACOVE SERIES

The Acove series consists of soils that are moderately deep to paralithic sandstone bedrock. These well drained soils formed in loamy residuum derived from sandstone of Cambrian age. These nearly level to strongly sloping soils are on shoulders and summits of ridges on dissected plateaus of the Central Basin. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C (67 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in).

REMARKS: 
The surface texture in the typical pedon was fine sandy loam and was changed based on National Soil Survey Laboratory data at the type location.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 38 cm (0 to 15 in) (A1 and A1 horizons)
Argillic horizon: 38 to 97 cm (15 to 38 in) (Bt horizons)
Stone line feature:  38 to 48 cm (15 to 19 in) (Bt1 horizon)
Paralithic contact:  soft, weathered sandstone bedrock at 97 cm (38 in) (top of Cr layer)
