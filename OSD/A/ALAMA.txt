ALAMA SERIES

The Alama series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from the redbed formations of Jurassic, Triassic, Permian, and Pennsylvanian age.  These soils are on terraces, alluvial fans, and piedmont slopes.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm (14 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 17 degrees C (62 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, thermic Ustic Haplocambids

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Hodgins and Reyab series.
Hodgins soils: have more than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the control section.
Reyab soils: have solum thickness of less than 100 cm and do not have segregated calcium carbonate in the lower horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent Material: alluvium derived principally from redbed formations of Jurassic, Triassic, Permian, and Pennsylvanian Age
Landform:  alluvial fans and piedmont slopes and rarely on low terraces
Slopes: 0 to 5 percent
Mean annual temperature: 15 to 19 degrees C (59 to 66 degrees F).
Mean annual Precipitation:  305 to 381 mm (12 to 15 in).
Precipitation pattern: Mostly summer thundershowers of short duration
Frost-free period: 180 to 215 days
Elevation: 1,040 to 1,680 meters (3,400 to 5,500 ft).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Hassell, Los Tanos, Montoya, and Tucumcari soils.
Hassell soils: more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser in the particle-size control section and are on slightly higher positions on pediments and truncated pediments below escarpments.
Los Tanos soils: less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section, have sandstone bedrock at depths of 50 to 100 cm, and are on slightly higher positions on low hills ridges, and mesas.
Montoya soils: more then 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have cracks more than 1 cm. wide when dry and are on lower positions on channeled flood plains, low terraces, and alluvial fans.
Tucumcari soils: have more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser in the particle-size control section and are on slightly lower positions on alluvial fans and valley slopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Runoff is negligible on slopes less than 1 percent, very low on 1 to 3 percent slopes, and low on 3 to 5 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Principal use is livestock grazing, but where irrigation water is available, some areas are used for growing grain sorghums, alfalfa, and cotton.  Present native vegetation is principally blue grama, black grama, galleta, tobosa, and alkali sacaton.  The ecological site is Loamy (R070XB052NM).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Upper Pecos River Valley (MLRA 70B in LRR G) of east-central New Mexico.  This series is of moderate extent.
