ALICE SERIES

The Alice series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils on upland hillslopes and river valley terraces.  They formed in moderately coarse textured alluvium and windblown material.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Alice fine sandy loam - irrigated cropland.  (Colors for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  Ap--0 to 9 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium granular structure; soft, very friable; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

  A--9 to 13 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; soft, very friable; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 10 inches thick)

  Bw--13 to 26 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure; soft, very friable; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (7 to 22 inches thick)

  Bk--26 to 43 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) fine sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure; soft, friable; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (6 to 18 inches thick)

  C1--43 to 57 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; soft, friable; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.

  C2--57 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) very fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline.
