MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Salem County, New Jersey, 1998

REMARKS: Alloway soils were formally mapped as Keyport in Salem County, New Jersey. However, Keyport soils are Hapludults. 06/97--Revisions to the series description and classification were to update the particle-size class to fine and the cation-exchange activity class to semiactive. 02/02--Revisions to expand the color and textural RIC required for MLRA update projects in NJ, MD, and DE.

Diagnostic horizons and other soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 11 inches (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 11 to 49 inches (Bt horizons).
Aquic conditions--the zone from about 24 inches to a depth of 80 inches is periodically saturated (endosaturation)

Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Paleudult feature--the zone from 0 to 60 inches (Ap, Bt horizons, and C horizon) does not have a decrease in clay content of 20 percent or more from the maximum clay content within this zone.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available from the Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE, pedons: S92NJ-033-010; S92NJ-033-014
