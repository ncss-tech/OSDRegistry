AU GRES SERIES

The Au Gres series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in sandy fluvial and lacustrine deposits on ice margin complexes, kame moraines, stream terraces, outwash plains, lake terraces, lake plains, and ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C. (43 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, frigid Typic Endoaquods

TYPICAL PEDON: Au Gres sand, on a northwest-facing, 1 percent slope in a forested area at an elevation of 360 meters (1,182 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

Rock fragment content: 0 to 10 percent throughout
Particle-size control section: averages less than 50 percent fine sand
Mean annual soil temperature: 5.5 to 8.3 degrees C (42 to 47 degrees F)

A or Ap horizon:

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Battlefield, Kinross, Wainola, and Wormet series. Battlefield soils have more than 10 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the control section. Kinross soils are saturated for a period of 90 to 120 days when the soil temperature is above 5 degrees C. Wainola soils average more than 50 percent fine sand in the particle-size control section. Wormet soils have a finer textured cap with sandy loam or fine sandy loam textures that is 25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 inches) thick. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Au Gres soils are on ice margin complexes, kame moraines, stream terraces, outwash plains, lake plains, lake terraces, and ground moraines of Wisconsinan age. Slope gradients are predominantly 0 to 3 percent and range from 0 to 6 percent. The Au Gres soils formed in sandy fluvial and lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 680 to 911 mm (27 to 36 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 4.4 to 8.3 degrees C (40 to 47 degrees F). Frost-free period is 90 to 146 days. Elevation is 183 to 549 meters (600 to 1,800 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Croswell, Kalkaska, Kinross, Deford, and Rubicon soils. The excessively drained Rubicon, somewhat excessively drained Kalkaska, and the moderately well drained Croswell soils are on higher landscape positions. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Deford and Kinross soils are in depressions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Depth to the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from 18 to 46 cm (0.5 to 1.5 feet) at some time between October and June in normal years. The soil is saturated for a period of 70 to 90 days when the soil temperature is above 5 degrees C. Potential surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Only a small part is cultivated. Some areas are in permanent pasture and others are used for growing special crops such as blueberries and cucumbers. Many areas are in various stages of reforestation. Natural forests are northern white-cedar, balsam fir, hemlock, yellow birch, paper birch, aspen, and red maple. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 89, 90A, 90B, 91B, 92, 93B, 94A, 94B, 94C, 94D, 96, 98, 142, 144A, and 144B in northern Lower Peninsula and Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Maine, Wisconsin, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts. The series is of large extent.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 13 cm (5 inches) (A and E horizons).
Albic horizon: from a depth of 8 to 13 cm (3 to 5 inches) (E horizon).
Spodic horizon: from a depth of 13 to 58 cm (5 to 23 inches) (Bhs and Bs horizons).
Aquic conditions (endosaturation): inferred from redox accumulations in the zone from 36 to 203 cm (14 to 80 inches) (Bs2, BC, and C horizons).

Loamy or clayey substratum phases of this soil are no longer within the series concept.
