ABREU SERIES

The Abreu series consists of deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from acid igneous and metamorphic rock on mountain footslopes and sideslopes.  Slopes range from 10 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 533 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 6.1 C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Udic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Abreu gravelly loam, forested. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 5 cm; decomposed and decomposing forest litter. (3 to 8 cm thick)

    A--5 to 13 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and few coarse roots; 30 percent gravel; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. (5 to 10 cm thick)

    E--13 to 43 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many fine, very fine, and few coarse roots; many fine tubular pores; 55 percent gravel; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. (28 to 38 cm thick)

    Bt1--43 to 81 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; few patches of pale brown (10YR 6/3) E material, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, sticky, plastic; few fine medium and coarse roots; common fine tubular pores; common moderately thick clay films on faces of peds and gravel; 45 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

    Bt2--81 to 114 cm brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely gravelly clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, sticky, plastic; few roots; common fine tubular pores; many moderately thick clay films on faces of peds and coating gravel; 60 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; slightly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. (combined thickness B1, B2 - 69 to 122 cm thick)

    R--114 cm; igneous bedrock; fractured in the upper few inches, soil material is in the cracks.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Albic horizon - 13 to 43 cm (E horizon)
Argillic horizon - 43 to 114 cm (Bt1, Bt2 horizons)
Lithic contact - 114 cm to hard igneous or metamorphic bedrock (R horizon)
Particle size control section - 43 to 93 cm (B1 and part of Bt2 horizon)

Abreu soils have a frigid temperature regime and are in an ustic soil moisture regime bordering on udic.
