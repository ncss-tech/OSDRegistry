ADELLERN SERIES

The Adellern series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist over residuum weathered from schist. Adellern soils are on north-facing backslopes of high hills. Slopes are 50 to 90 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Braziel, Fessler, Mapache, Pastorius, Pastorpeak and Zillion series. Braziel soils are presumed to be dry in the moisture control section during July and August. Fessler soils have rock fragments of argillite and have less mica. Mapache soils have rock fragments of dacite and latite.  Pastorious soils have less mica and greater than 10 percent cobbles in the argillic horizon. Pastorpeak soils have carbonate accumulations within 40 inches. Zillion soils have a calcic horizon. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Adellern soils are on backslopes of hills and mountains. They formed in Precambrian Age colluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist over residuum weathered from schist. Slopes are 50 to 90 percent. Elevation ranges from 7,400 to 9,100 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches with about 40 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 110 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Atalaya, Enmedio, Fiesta, and Morenda soils. Atalaya soils are coarse-loamy over fragmental, do not have mollic epipedons, and occur on beveled summits. Enmedio soils are loamy-skeletal over fragmental and occur on south-facing backslopes of hills. Fiesta soils are fine-loamy and occur on footslopes of valley sides. Morenda soils are coarse-loamy, have water tables within 5 feet, and occur on low stream terraces of valley floors.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; very high runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Adellern soils are used for timber production, urban development, and recreation. The historic climax vegetation is ponderosa pine, Gambel's oak, mountain muhly, and muttongrass.  The ecological site is Pinus ponderosa/Quercus gambleii (F048AY010NM). 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Adellern soils are of small extent on the southwestern Sangre de Cristo part of the Southern Rocky Mountains province in northcentral New Mexico. The MLRA is 48A.
