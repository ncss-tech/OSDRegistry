ABERT SERIES

The Abert series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material derived from volcanic ash over lacustrine deposits derived from mixed volcanic rocks and volcanic ash.  Abert soils are on lakebeds.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Thornlake and Tonor series.

Thornlake soils do not have visible pumiceous ash grains in any horizon.  Tonor soils do not have visible pumiceous ash grains in any horizon, are influenced by diatom grains, and have horizons between 100 and 150 cm with more than 35 percent pararock fragments.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Abert soils are on lakebeds. These soils formed in eolian material and lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic ash over lacustrine deposits derived from mixed volcanic rocks and volcanic ash. The source of the volcanic ash is ancestral Mt. Mazama. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations range from 1,280 to 1,500 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bonnick, Fort Rock, Kunceider, Morehouse, and Wegert soils.  Bonnick soils have mollic epipedons and ashy sandy textures in the particle-size control section.  Fort Rock soils are ashy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and have mollic epipedons.  Kunceider soils are ashy-skeletal, shallow to lithic contacts, have mollic epipedons, and are on adjacent lava plains. Morehouse soils have ashy sandy textures in the particle-size control section and are on adjacent stable dunes.  Wegert soils are ashy, moderately deep to lithic contacts, have mollic epipedons, and are on adjacent lava plains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; negligible surface runoff; moderate or moderately slow permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Abert soils are used for irrigated cropland, livestock grazing, and wildlife habitat. Alfalfa hay is the main crop. The vegetation in rangeland is basin big sagebrush, green rabbitbrush, gray rabbitbrush, basin wildrye, and inland saltgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Oregon.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 23.
