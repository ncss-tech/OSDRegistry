MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Salina, Kansas 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Morton County, Kansas, 1996 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches) (A horizon). 
When this horizon meets the color requirements of a mollic epipedon, it fails to meet the thickness requirements. 
JCW- 07/2004 Updated the OSD with metric measurements changed temperature in geographic setting to meet mesic requirements. The opening paragraph was updated to include terraces and deleted erosional remnants. The type location was changed to better fit with lab data. Taxonomy was updated to haplustept using Soil Taxonomy Ninth Edition.
TDC - 05/2018 Changed the parent material to better represent the series extent
TDC - 05/2018 Changed the terrace landform to valley sides to better represent the series extent
