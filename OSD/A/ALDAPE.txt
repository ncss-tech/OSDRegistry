ALDAPE SERIES

The Aldape series consists of deep to a duripan, well drained soils with moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity that formed in alluvium from lacustrine deposits and volcanic ash. Slopes range from 3 to 35 percent in foothills and valleys. The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the average annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Barshaad and Mahoon series. Barshaad and Mahoon soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to paralithic contact. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Aldape soils are on southerly facing hill backslopes and footslopes, structural benches, fan remnants and landslides at elevations of 2,600 to 3,750 feet. Slopes range from 3 to 35 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from lacustrine deposits and volcanic ash. Average annual precipitation is 11 to 16 inches. Average annual temperature is 49 to 52 degrees F. Frost-free period is 125 to 155 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Adelmann , Chilcott, and Cranegulch soils. Adelmann soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and are not abruptic. Cranegulch have a xeric soil moisture regime and are not abruptic. Chilcott soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a duripan and have an ochric epipedon. These soils are on similar landscape positions. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Aldape soils are used mainly for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The dominant natural vegetation is basin big sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass. Some areas are used for irrigated hayland/pasture or homesites. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwestern Idaho. MLRA 11. Aldape soils are not extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Boise Front Project, Ada County, Idaho, 1996. 

REMARKS: The type location was moved due to cut and fill homesite development at the original site.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
Mollic epipedon - zone 0 to 11 inches (A1 and A2 horizons)
Argillic horizon - zone 11 to 35 inches (Bt/E, Bt1, Bt2 and Btk horizons)
Abrupt textural change - 11 to14 inches; est. 20% clay increase within 3 inches ( Bt/E horizon)
Duripan - at 53 inches (Bkqm horizon)
Linear extensibility - 4.0 to 6.0 cm (assumed) from 0 to 40 inches
Particle-size control section - zone 11 to 31 inches
Soil moisture regime - aridic bordering on xeric

These soils are drier than other Xerolls in the region under similar precipitation due to early runoff and extended period of high evapotranspiration.
