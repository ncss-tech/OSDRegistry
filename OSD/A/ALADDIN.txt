ALADDIN SERIES 

The Aladdin series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly alluvium derived mostly from monzonite and granite.  Aladdin soils are on mountain fronts, alluvial fans, and fan piedmonts of Holocene age.  Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.

TYPE LOCATION:  Dona Ana County, (Desert Soil-Geomorphology Project), New Mexico; north bank of arroyo; in the SW 1/4, SW 1/4 of Section 36, T.21 S., R.4 E. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil Moisture:  Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during December - April and July - September.  Driest during May and June.  Aridic ustic soil moisture regime.

Soil Temperature:  60 to 68 degrees F. 

Calcium carbonate:  Noneffervescent to at least 7 inches; commonly noneffervescent to depths of several feet.  Any carbonate accumulation is too slight for a calcic horizon

Control Section - 

Organic matter:  Greater than 1.0 percent to a depth of at least 7 inches and less than 1.0 percent below 20 inches and decreases regularly with depth

Texture:  ranges from gravelly sandy loam to gravelly loam 

Clay content:  less than 18 percent clay 

A horizon
Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR
Value:  3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma:  1 to 3, dry or moist

B horizon
Commonly these soils have a slight accumulation of illuvial clay, but too little for an argillic horizon.  This horizon is considered to be a cambic horizon
Hue:  5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR
Value:  3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma:  1 to 4, dry or moist

C horizon
Hue:  7.5YR, 10YR
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma:  3 or 4, dry or moist

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Aladdin soils are along the mountain fronts and on alluvial fans and fan piedmonts of Holocene age.  Slopes range from about 1 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in gravelly sediments derived mostly from monzonite and granite.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 14 to 18 inches with a marked summer maximum.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 57 to 66 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 180 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Berino, Bucklebar, Caralampi, Hawkeye, Monza, Onate, Onite, Pinaleno, Santo Tomas, and Summerford soils.  Berino, Bucklebar, Caralampi, Onite, Pinaleno and Summerford soils have argillic horizons and do not have mollic epipedons.  Also, Berino and Bucklebar soils have fine-loamy control sections.  Caralampi, Pinaleno, and Santo Tomas soils are skeletal.  Hawkeye soils have sandy control sections.  Monza soils are shallow to highly weathered bedrock.  Onate soils have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation includes snakeweed, Yucca elata, cholla, prickly pear, and scattered clumps of fluffgrass and blue grama. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern New Mexico.  Aladdin soils are of small extent.  MLRA is 42.

REMARKS:

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - The zone from 0 to 14 inches (A1, A2, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons)

Cambic horizon - The zone from 5 to 27 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)

This series represents an identified soil within the Desert Soil-Geomorphology Project, Las Cruces, New Mexico.  The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment.  The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.  Its revision outside the project area is discouraged in order to preserve the historical concept for research.

Recent evidence suggests soils within this precipitation zone and MLRA are moist in some part of the mollic epipedon less than 90 days (cumulative) and therefore do not meet the moisture requirements for a mollic epipedon.  Alternative subgroups are Ustic Torriorthents or Ustic Haplocambids.
