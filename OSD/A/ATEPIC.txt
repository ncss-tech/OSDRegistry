ATEPIC SERIES

The Atepic series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from shale. Atepic soils are on hillsides. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 350 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 9.5 degrees C.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Average 27 to 35 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Atepic soils are on moderately steep and steep hillslopes and mountain slopes at elevations of 1,645 to 2,200 meters.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  They formed in colluvium and residuum from shale. The climate is dry subhumid.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 7.0 to 11.0 degrees C.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 300 to 400 mm.  The freeze free season is 100 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Borvant, Fontreen, Lodar, Lizzant and Rapho soils.  All of these soils except Rapho have mollic epipedons.  Borvant soils have petrocalcic horizons.  Lodar soils are 50 cm deep or less over a lithic contact.  Lizzant, Fontreen, and Rapho soils are more than 50 cm deep to a lithic or paralithic contact.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; high runoff; slow permeability; moderately low hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for livestock grazing and to a limited extent for woodland.  Principal vegetation is juniper, pinion, phlox, bitterbrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.  In Utah this series is correlated with upland range sites.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Utah. MLRA 28A and 47. The series is moderately extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Sanpete County, Utah, 1971.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to 18 cm (A1, A2 and part of the Bw horizons).
Calcic horizon - the zone of calcium carbonate accumulation from 28 to 43 cm (Bk horizon).
Paralithic contact - weathered shale at 43 cm (Cr horizon)
Particle-size control section - the zone from 25 to 43 cm (part of Bk horizon.

The classification is based on the "Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eighth Edition, 1998".
