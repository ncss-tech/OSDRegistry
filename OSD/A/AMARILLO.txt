AMARILLO SERIES

The Amarillo series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils. These soils formed in loamy eolian deposits from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. Amarillo soils are on nearly level to gently sloping plains and playa slopes. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 483 mm (19 in) and the mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the similar Acuff, Arvana, Patricia, Seagraves, Spantara, and Tokio series; and the Brownfield, Lamesa, Drake, Midessa, Posey, Ranco, Sharvana, Sparenberg, and Sparks series. 
Acuff, Arvana, Patricia, and Spantara soils: are on similar landscape positions. 
Brownfield soils: are on similar landscape positions but have a sandy particle-size class from 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 in) thick over the argillic horizon. 
Lamesa soils: are on lower landscape positions and have an aquic moisture regime. 
Drake soils: are on higher landscape positions and do not have an argillic horizon. 
Midessa soils: are on slightly lower landscape positions and do not have an argillic horizon. 
Posey soils: are on similar landscape positions, are calcareous throughout, and have a calcic horizon within 50 cm of the soil surface. 
Ranco and Sparenberg soils: are on lower landscape positions in playa basins and have LE greater than 6 in the upper 1 meter of the soil. 
Sharvana soils are on similar landscape positions but have a petrocalcic horizon between 20 and 51 cm (8 and 20 in) 
Sparks soils: are on similar landscape positions but have more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. 
Tokio soils: are on slightly lower landscape positions. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained and moderately permeable. Surface runoff is negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes and low on 1 to 5 percent slopes. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used for cropland but also used as native rangeland and wildlife habitat. Principal crops grown are cotton, grain sorghum, and wheat. Climax vegetation in rangeland is mainly short and mid grasses, with mid grasses tending to dominate, with a smaller tall grass component. This site is dominated by blue grama with lesser amounts of sideoats grama, buffalograss, little bluestem, gaura, plains zinnia, prairieclover, bundleflower, wild alfalfa, and ephedra. Woody plants include catclaw sensitivebrier, yucca, and sand sagebrush. Dominant vegetation on the loamy fine sands includes sideoats grama, bluestems, and switchgrass, and on the fine sandy loams includes sideoats grama, blue grama, buffalograss, and Arizona cottontop. This soil has been correlated to the Sandy Loam (R077CY036TX) and Sandy (R077CY035TX) ecological sites in MLRA-77C. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern High Plains, Southern Part (MLRA 77C in LRR H) of western Texas and eastern New Mexico. The series is extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Randall County, Texas. (Reconnaissance Soil Survey of Panhandle Region of Texas); 1920. 

REMARKS: This is a Benchmark Series. 
Keys to Soil Taxonomy, tenth edition, classify this series as an Aridic Haplustalfs. The series has a silicate clay decrease exceeding 20 percent due to dilution by secondary calcium carbonate. A proposal to maintain "pale" status for such soils on old stable landscapes has been submitted to the National Leader for Soil Taxonomy and Standards. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: from 0 to 28 cm (0 to 11 in) (A horizon) 
Argillic horizon: from 28 to 251 cm (11 to 99 in) (Bt, Btk1, Btkk, B'tk2, and B'tk3 horizons) 
Calcic horizon: from 98 to 251 cm (27 to 99 in) (Btkk, B'tk2, and B'tk3 horizons) 
Plugged (kk) horizon: 98 to 142 cm (39 to 56 in) (Btkk) 

Note: the kk feature is defined as pedogenic carbonate accumulation that is characterized by laterally continuous carbonates that have engulfed rock, sand, silt, and clay particles; plugged the macroporosity of the soil horizon with 50 percent or more calcium carbonate; and obliterated the original soil structure.
