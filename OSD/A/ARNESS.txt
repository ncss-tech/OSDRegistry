ARNESS SERIES

The Arness series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium and residuum derived from ignimbrite, tuff, and volcanic ash. Arness soils are on structural benches and hills. Slopes are 1 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid, shallow Argiduridic Durixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Arness sandy loam--on a 2 percent slope at 1,620 meters elevation--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. When described on June 6, l982, the soil was slightly moist throughout.)

(3 to 50 cm thick) 

    2R--81 cm; black (10YR 2/1) ignimbrite (densely welded, vitric ash-flow tuff).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Blayden and Vil series. 

Blayden and Vil soils are greater than 150 cm deep to bedrock. In addition, Vil soils have duripans that are 50 to 100 cm thick. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Arness soils are on structural benches and hills. These soils formed in alluvium residuum or colluvium derived from ignimbrite, tuff, and volcanic ash. Slopes are 1 to 20 percent. Elevations range from 1,400 to 1,800 meters. The mean annual precipitation is 280 to 330 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 100 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chuska, Lud, Mug, and Tock soils. Chuska soils occur on lower surfaces and have mesic temperature regime. Lud soils are fine. Mug soils are clayey-skeletal and are moderately deep to tuff. Tock soils are fine and are moderately deep to duripans. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very high surface runoff; moderately slow permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Arness soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is basin big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Sandberg's bluegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Idaho and south-central Oregon. These soils are not extensive with about 6,900 acres of the series mapped to date. The series concept and main acreage is in MLRA 25 in Idaho, while other acreage occurs in MLRA 23 in Oregon.
