AHMEEK SERIES

The Ahmeek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in a friable loamy mantle and the underlying dense loamy till.  These soils are on till plains, moraines, and drumlins.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Aldenlake, Linneus, and Mesaba series.
Aldenlake--have sandy textures dominant in the lower third of the series control section
Linneus--have sola terminated by bedrock within the series control section
Mesaba--have sola terminated by bedrock within the series control section

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils have linear to convex slopes that range from 0 to 45 percent.  They typically are on till plains, moraines or drumlins.  They formed in a friable loamy mantle and the underlying dense, firm and very firm, loamy Superior lobe till of the Late Wisconsinan glaciation.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 2 to 6 degrees C. and mean annual precipitation ranges from 710 to 790 mm. Annual frost free days range from 80 to 140.  The elevation above sea level ranges from 200 to 600 meters.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Normanna, Hermantown, Canosia, Giese, Cathro and Twig soils.  The moderately well drained Normanna and somewhat poorly drained Hermantown soils are on lower lying or less sloping positions on the landscape.  The poorly drained Canosia soils are in drainageways, and on flats and toeslopes.  The very poorly drained Giese and Twig soils are in depressions or drainageways.  The very poorly drained Cathro soils are in depressions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--well drained--frequent saturation does not occur within a depth of 2.0 meters during the wettest periods of normal years
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--4.23 to 42.34 micrometers per second (0.6 to 6.0 inches per hour)in the loamy mantle and 0.01 to 0.42 micrometers per second (0.0015 to 0.06 inches per hour)in the underlying dense till

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of this soil is forested.  A small portion is cropped to small grains and hay or is in pasture.  Native vegetation was mixed deciduous-coniferous forest.  Major species of trees are quaking aspen, paper birch, balsam fir, northern red oak, and eastern white pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Physiographic Divisions--Laurentian Upland or Interior Plains
Physiographic Provinces--Superior Upland or Central Lowland
Physiographic sections--undefined(if in the Superior Upland Province) or Western lake section(if in the Central Lowland Province)
MLRAs--Superior Stony and Rocky Loamy Plains and Hills, Western Part(93A) and Wisconsin and Minnesota Thin Loess and Till, Northern Part(90A)
LRR K;  Northeastern Minnesota and possibly northwestern Wisconsin.
Extent--large

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Houghton County, Michigan in 1943.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 10 centimeters (A horizon);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 10 to 89 centimeters (Bw1, Bw2 and 2BC horizons);
dystric subgroup--no carbonates within a depth of 1 meter;
densic contact--at a depth of 89 centimeters;
Isotic mineralogy--based on a 15 kPa water to measured clay ratio equal to or greater than 0.6

The designation of the 2BCd horizon is based on fractures and platy structure in the densic material.  Evidence of clay and silt translocation can be seen on faces of peds.
