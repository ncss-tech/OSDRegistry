ALVEY SERIES 

The Alvey series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium and reworked eolian material derived from sandstone and shale. Alvey soils are on alluvial flats, and fan remnants. Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Calciargids 

TYPICAL PEDON: Alvey very fine sandy loam, on rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The surface is covered by 2 percent gravel.

        A--0 to 2 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 4 inches thick) 

        AB--2 to 11 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 20 inches thick) 

        Btk1--11 to 35 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) clay loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; strongly effervescent; carbonates segregated in soft masses; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 25 inches thick) 

        Btk2--35 to 50 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) clay loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; violently effervescent; carbonates segregated in hard masses and disseminated throughout; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary. (12 to 30 inches thick) 

        C--50 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) clay loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; massive; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

Barx, Cerrillos and Spenlo soils have 2.5YR to 7.5YR hue. 
Clovis soils receive more than half of it annual precipitation between the months of July and October. 
Fernando soils contain 50 to 80 percent silt in the solum and mapped in MLRA 51. 
Maysdorf soils contain less than 15 percent carbonates in the calcic horizon. 
Horchata soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact.
Los Alamos soils have 5 to 15 percent pumice fragments and ash in the particle size control section, and Bt horizon thickness range from 6 to 14 inches.
