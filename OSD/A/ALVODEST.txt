ALVODEST SERIES

The Alvodest series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine sediments.  Alvodest soils are on basin floors and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Sodic Aquicambids

TYPE LOCATION:  Harney County, Oregon; about 3.5 miles east of Fields in the SW1/4 NE1/4 section 21, T. 38 S., R. 35 E.; latitude  42 degrees 15 minutes 36 seconds N and longitude 118 degrees 36 minutes 39 seconds W; NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil Moisture: Usually dry, but in most years are saturated with water within 100 cm of the surface in late winter and spring.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 10 degrees C.  
Reaction: Very strongly alkaline throughout.  
Salinity (EC): Greater than 16 mmhos/cm. throughout the profile and is highest in the surface.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 40 to 60 percent.

A horizon
Value: 6 or 7, and 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3 moist and dry.
Sodicity (SAR): 800 to 1,000.  
Other features: 0.5 to 1.0 percent organic matter.

B horizon
Value: 5 through 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 2 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Texture: silty clay, clay or silty clay loam with 35 to 60 percent clay.  Sodicity (SAR): 70 to 700.
Other features: angular blocky or prismatic.

C horizon
Value: 6 through 8 dry, 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3 moist and dry.
Texture: silty clay loam, silty clay or loam with 25 to 50 percent clay.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Droval series.  Droval soils have an SAR of 45 to 80 and contain 1 to 3 percent gypsum in the subsoil.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The soils are on basin floors at elevations of 1,200 to 1,500 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The soils formed in lacustrine sediment.  The climate is characterized by cool moist winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 180 to 250 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 80 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Boravall, Catlow, Davey, Defenbaugh, the competing Droval, Enko and Goldrun soils.  Goldrun soils are sandy throughout and are on sand dunes.  Boravall soils are poorly drained and have an aquic moisture regime.  Catlow soils are loamy-skeletal and are on old beach terraces.  Davey soils have sandy particle-size control section.  Defenbaugh soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section.  Enko soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly to moderately well drained; slow permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Flooding is none to rare.  A water table is at 15 cm above the surface to 76 cm below the surface from December to April.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The soils are used for livestock grazing.  Vegetation is black greasewood, basin wildrye and inland saltgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Oregon, and Northwestern Nevada; MLRA 24.  The series is of moderate extent.
