ALBERTON SERIES

The Alberton series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Alberton very fine sandy loam, cropland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap--0 to 9 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, and nonplastic; many fine and medium roots; many very fine pores; neutral (pH 7.3); abrupt smooth boundary.  (7 to 10 inches thick)

    A2--9 to 16 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky, and nonplastic; many fine roots; many fine pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw--16 to 30 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, and nonplastic; common fine roots; common fine pores; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary.  (12 to 16 inches thick)

    BC--30 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loamy sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky, and nonplastic; 10 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  Missoula County, Montana; approximately 500 feet west and 200 feet south of the N 1/4 corner of sec. 34, T. 15 N., R. 21 W.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Secret Creek (t) series.  These soils have a solum less than 25 inches thick and a component of vitric pyroclastic materials.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Alberton soils are on terraces.  Elevations are 2,800 to 3,500 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium.  The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm, dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 11 to 14 inches, much of which falls as show and as spring rain.  Mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 105 to 120 days.

DRAINAGE AND PEREMABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; slow runoff; moderately rapid permeability above 30 inches and rapid below.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Alberton soils are used mainly for irrigated crops.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Alberton soils are of small extent in valleys of western Montana.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Missoula County, Montana, 1985.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 16 inches (Ap, A horizons); a cambic horizon from 16 to 30 inches (Bw horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (A, Bw, BC horizons).  Alberton soils have an aridic moisture regime bordering on xeric and have a frigid temperature regime.
