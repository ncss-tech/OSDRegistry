ABSAROOK SERIES 

The Absarook series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, or residuum from hard sandstone or fine grained igneous bedrock.  These soils are on sedimentary plains, hills and ridges.  Slopes are 2 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Absarook loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 5 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium and fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 12 inches thick) 

    Bt1--5 to 13 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to strong fine angular blocky; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine tubular pores; common distinct dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay films on ped and gravel surfaces; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual wavy boundary. 

    Bt2--13 to 25 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common fine and many very fine roots; common fine and very fine tubular pores; distinct dark grayish brown clay films on ped and gravel surfaces; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of Bt horizons is 8 to 20 inches.)
