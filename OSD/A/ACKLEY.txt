ACKLEY SERIES

The Ackley series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  They are on fans and terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and mean annual temperature is 11 degrees C.

Abgese soils have carbonates at 46 to 60 cm, 20 to 25 percent gravel in the particle-size control section, and 30 to 60 percent gravel in the C horizon. Blacknest soils have sand and gravel at 50 to 100 cm.  Bluelight, Colbar, Nosser and Sidlake soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Eusbio are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Greenbrae soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Hardtrigger soils are moderately or strongly alkaline in the Bk horizon and have carbonates at 25 to 69 cm. Harsan soils have a duripan at 100 to 152 cm. Hoosegow soils have a BC horizon below the argillic that lacks carbonates. Hoye soils have a combined thickness of the A and Bt of less than 20 cm. Lankbush soils have a coarse sand 2C horizon and lack carbonates in the C horizon.  Morfitt soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Shawave soils have a soil temperature of 12 to 13 degrees C and slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline A and BT horizons. Turria soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon and combined thickness of A and Bt horizons is than 50 cm. Windypoint soils have sand and gravel at a depth of 64 to 100 cm and depth to carbonate of 30 to 46 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ackley soils are on fans and terraces.  They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevations are 1,300 to 1,800 meters.  The mean annual temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C and the mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm. Frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Reno, Fulstone, and Hunewill soils.  Reno and Fulstone soils are on older surfaces and have a duripan.  Hunewill soils are skeletal and combined thickness of A and Bt horizons is less than 50 cm.
