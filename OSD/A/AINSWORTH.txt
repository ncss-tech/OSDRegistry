AINSWORTH SERIES

The Ainsworth series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in 100 to 150 centimeters of silty alluvium and the underlying sandy sediments.  These soils are on treads and risers on stream terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 825 millimeters.
