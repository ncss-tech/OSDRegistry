ALSCO SERIES

The Alsco series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in granite and gneiss alluvium.  Alsco soils are on high dissected alluvial fans near steep mountains and have slopes of 5 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about l2 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 1/4 F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic Ustic Calciargids

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Beewon (TX), Nolam (NM) and Throne (AZ) series. Bewon and Nolam soils have 7.5YR and redder hues. Throne and Beewon soils are inactive.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Alsco soils are on convex side slopes and narrow ridges of gently sloping to steep alluvial fans adjacent to steep mountains at elevations of 3,500 to 5,000 feet.  Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent.  These soils formed in extremely cobbly and stony alluvium from granite and gneiss.  The climate is semiarid continental.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 60 1/4 to 68 1/4 F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from l0 to l4 inches.  The frost-free period is l80 to 220 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Maloy (T) and Pinaleno soils and the Comoro, Eba, Eloma (T), Santo Tomas, and Selevin (T) soils.  Comoro soils are coarse-loamy.  Eba, Eloma (T), and Selevin (T) soils are clayey-skeletal.  Santo Tomas soils lack an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing.  Native vegetation is black grama, sideoats grama, bush muhly, slim tridens, Arizona cottontop, threeawn, spike pappusgrass, and Rothrock grama.  The shrub species include creosotebush, whitethorn, ocotillo, wolfberry, brittlebush, mesquite, catclaw, false mesquite, and cacti.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Arizona and possibly southwest New Mexico.  Alsco soils are of small extent.  MLRA 41.
