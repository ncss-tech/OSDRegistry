ARDENVOIR SERIES

The Ardenvoir series consists of deep, well drained soils on mountains and foothills. They formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from metasedimentary bedrock, predominantly siltite and fine grained quartzite with a mantle of loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Slope ranges from 5 to 90 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 29 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ardenvoir soils are on mountains and foothills. Slope ranges from 5 to 90 percent. They occupy all aspects at lower elevations, but mainly occupy southerly aspects at higher elevations. They formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from metasedimentary bedrock, predominantly siltite and fine grained quartzite with a mantle of loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash. Elevation ranges from 2,200 to 5,100 feet (670 to 1555 meters). The mean annual air temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 35 inches (483 to 889 mm). The frost-free period is from 80 to 120 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Huckle (T) and Honeyjones soils. Huckle and Honeyjones soils have thick volcanic ash mantles and are on adjacent foothills and mountains. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, grazing, wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed. Potential natural overstory vegetation is mainly grand fir, Douglas-fir, western larch, and ponderosa pine with an understory of creambush oceanspray, mallow ninebark, common snowberry, spirea, rose, western meadowrue, Idaho goldthread, scouler willow, redstem ceanothus, myrtle pachystima, and pine reedgrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Idaho and eastern Washington; MLRA 43A, 9 and 6. This soil is moderately extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Chelan County, Washington, 1969. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 6 inches (Oi, Oe and A horizon) 
Cambic horizon - the zone from 6 to 19 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)
Vitrandic feature the zone from 2 to 11 inches (A and Bw1 horizons) 
Particle-size control section - the zone from 12 to 42 inches (part of the Bw2 horizon, the C1 horizon and part of the C2 horizon) with weighted average rock fragments of 39 percent. 

Classification revised 7/04 from loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haploxerepts to loamy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Vitrandic Haploxerepts based on laboratory data. 

Type location moved to Idaho, August, 1980. 

Modal concept of this series regarding bedrock, is one of a 40 to 60 inch depth to paralithic contact.  It is currently mapped in the Cashmere Mountain Areas, Washington  (WA608); Chelan County Area, Washington (WA607), Benewah County Area, Idaho (ID620 and ID607 out of date), and Latah County, Idaho (ID057).  In all surveys except the Cashmere Mountain Survey, the series concept defines a paralithic contact as the modal.  The OSD will be revised to reflect a paralithic contact and documentation made in the Cashmere Mt. soil survey database to reflect the need to review the Ardenvoir series concept during the update process for MLRA 3.  09/06
