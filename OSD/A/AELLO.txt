	Oe--0 to 65 cm (0 to 26 in); mucky peat, 50 percent brown (10YR 5/3) and 50 percent grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry, 50 percent dark brown (10YR 3/3) rubbed and 50 percent very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) rubbed and moist; nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots throughout; moderately acid (pH 5.9); clear smooth boundary. (50 to 75 cm, 20 to 30 in)

	Oef--65 to 85 cm (26 to 34 in); permanently frozen mucky peat, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) rubbed moist; noncoherent, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots throughout; moderately acid (pH 5.9); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 25 cm, 4 to 10 in)

TYPE LOCATION: North Copper River Survey Area, Alaska; latitude 62.74242 N, longitude -143.66893 W, 6959714.39 north, and 363650.29 east, zone 7, Datum WGS84.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture regime: Udic
Soil temperature regime: Gelic
Mean annual soil temperature: -4 to 1 degrees C. (25 to 34 degrees F)
Thickness of organic material: 60 to 85 cm (24 to 33 in)
Depth to Aquic Conditions: 0 cm
Depth to redoximorphic depletions: 60 to 100 cm (24 to 39 in)
Depth to permafrost: 50 to 75 cm (20 to 30 in)

Oe horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 3 to 5
Chroma: 1 to 3
Texture: peat to mucky peat
Organic matter: 60 to 90 percent
Reaction class: Very strongly acid to moderately acid (pH 4.5 to 6)

Cf horizon:
Hue: 2.5Yor 5Y
Value: 4 to 5
Chroma: 1 to 2
Texture: silt loam to sandy loam
Sand: 5 to 60 percent
Silt: 28 to 83 percent
Clay: 2 to 12 percent
Organic matter: 0.4 to 3 percent
Reaction class: slightly acid to neutral (pH 6.1 to 7.3)

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bolio (AK) and Wrangell (AK) soils.
Bolio soils lack a mineral horizon within 100 cm (39 in) of the soil surface and occur on slight depressions or naturally drained lake basins in uplands and terraces.
Wrangell soils have mineral soil contact within 60 cm (24 in) of the soil surface and occur on depressions on broad lacustrine terraces.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Elevation: 500 to 1200 meters (1640 to 3940 ft)
Parent material: mossy organic materials over silty loess and or silty till
Landform: depressions on till plains
Slopes: 0 to 5 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 400 to 800 mm (16 to 31 in)
Mean annual air temperature: -4 to -2 degrees C. (25 to 28 degrees F)
Frost free period: 36 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ahtell and Hungryhollow soils. 
Ahtell soils are well drained, lack permafrost, have folistic and umbric epipedons, and occur on hill tops, and hillside positions.
Hungryhollow soils are poorly drained, lack permafrost, have a sapric horizon, and occur on depressions in interior valleys.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class: Very poorly drained
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: high in the unfrozen organic horizons, very low in the permafrost layers.
Permeability: Rapid in the unfrozen organic horizons and impermeable in the frozen horizons.
Runoff: negligible

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Use: wildlife habitat, recreation, and subsistence
Native vegetation: Bigelow's sedge, water sedge, cotton grass, common spikerush, bluejoint grass, and sphagnum moss

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 228 Interior Alaska Mountains. 
Extent: limited
