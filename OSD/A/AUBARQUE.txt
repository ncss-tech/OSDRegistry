AUBARQUE SERIES

The Aubarque series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are shallow or moderately deep to dense till. These soils formed in loamy till on till plains and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, semiactive, calcareous, mesic Aeric Epiaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Aubarque loam, on a 1 percent slope in an area cropped to winter wheat on a till plain. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 30 cm (12 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; moderate fine granular structure; friable; common fine roots; 3 percent gravel and cobbles; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. [20 to 33 cm (8 to 13 inches) thick]

 Bw--30 to 43 cm (12 to 17 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam; weak thin platy structure parting to weak very fine angular blocky; friable; common fine roots; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) coatings on faces of peds; common fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron; 3 percent gravel and cobbles; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary. [8 to 28 cm (3 to 11 inches) thick]

 Cd1--43 to 81 cm (17 to 32 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) loam; strong medium platy fragments; very firm; few fine roots along vertical faces of fragments; 70 percent pale brown (10YR 6/3) and 30 percent grayish brown (10YR 5/2) coatings on faces of fragments; common fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; 5 percent gravel and cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. [38 to 51 cm (15 to 20 inches) thick]

 Cd2--81 to 114 cm (32 to 45 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam; strong thick platy fragments; very firm; gray (10YR 6/1) coatings on faces of fragments; few medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; 5 percent gravel and cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. [25 to 41 cm (10 to 16 inches) thick]

 Cd3--114 to 147 cm (45 to 58 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) loam; moderate thick platy fragments; extremely firm; dark reddish brown (5YR 2/2) coatings on faces of fragments; few fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; 5 percent gravel and cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. [25 to 33 cm (10 to 13 inches thick)

 Cd4--147 to 178 cm (58 to 70 inches); reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) loam; weak thick platy fragments; extremely firm; dark reddish brown (5YR 2/2) and dark gray (10YR 4/1) coatings on faces of fragments; 5 percent gravel and cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Huron County, Michigan; about 3 miles south of Harbor Beach; 1,540 feet south and 470 feet east of the center of sec. 30, T. 16 N., R. 16 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Depth to densic contact: typically 28 to 50 cm (11 to 20 inches) but ranges to 61 cm (24 inches); see REMARKS
Depth to carbonates: less than 25 cm (10 inches)
Rock fragment content: 2 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 7 percent cobbles throughout

Ap horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 3 or 4
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: commonly loam or less commonly silt loam or sandy loam
Reaction: typically slightly alkaline but is neutral in some pedons

Bw horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 5 or 6
Chroma: 2 to 4
Surface features: faces of peds have value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2
Texture: typically loam but may have silt loam lenses occupying up to 15 percent of the horizon
Reaction: slightly alkaline

Cd horizon:
Hue: 2.5YR to 10YR
Values: 4 to 6
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: loam
Special features: vertical or oblique fracture planes are observable in the C horizons in an exposed cut; fractures are at intervals of 30 to 91 cm (12 to 36 inches); any root penetration occurs along these fracture planes
Reaction: moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Aubarque soils are on till plains and moraines of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. These soils formed in loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 940 mm (29 to 37 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.2 to 11.1 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Aubarque soils are part of a drainage sequence which includes the moderately well drained Grindstone soils. Shebeon and Kilmanagh soils are associated in some places where the very firm and extremely firm till is deeper than 61 cm (24 inches). Badaxe soils are associated where a thin sandy loam layer overlies the loam till.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. The potential for surface runoff is medium to very high depending on slope and depth of dense till. Downward movement of water is restricted by the platy nature of the compact till. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and low in the Cd horizon. Permeability is moderate in the solum and very slow in the Cd horizon.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of these soils are cultivated. Corn, beans, and small grains are the principal crops.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 99 in the thumb area of lower Michigan. The series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Huron County, Michigan, 1978.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 30 cm (12 inches) (Ap horizon).
Cambic horizon: from a depth of 30 to 43 cm (12 to 17 inches) (Bw horizon).
Densic contact: at 43 cm (17 inches) (top of the Cd1 horizon).
Aquic conditions: coatings with chroma of 2 in the Bw horizon between depths of 30 to 43 cm (12 to 17 inches).

Field investigation is needed to determine of this series belongs in a shallow family.
