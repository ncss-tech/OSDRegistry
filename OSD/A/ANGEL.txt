COMPETING SERIES: These are the Gilmore, and Brigadier series. Gilmore series has a substratum consisting weathered schist. Brigadier series has substratum weathered schist.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: Loess overlying weathered residuum granite bedrock
Landform: backslopes, shoulders, and summits of hills and low mountains 
Slope: 0 to 60 percent
Mean annual temperature: 23 to 28 degrees F., -5 to -2 C.
Mean annual precipitation: 10 to 15 inches, 250 to 380 mm

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the McCloud and Ester.  Ester soils have permafrost.  McCloud soils have more than 20 inches of mineral soil material above weathered granite bedrock

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: well drained, medium to high runoff, saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the loamy surface mantle and high in the weathered granite bedrock.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for military training, road fill, recreation, water supply, and wildlife habitat.  Most areas are in native forest consisting of paper birch, white spruce, black spruce, and quaking aspen.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 231, Interior Alaska Highlands, The series is of moderate extent.
