ARDLON SERIES

The Ardlon series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from quartzite and sedimentary rocks.  Ardlon soils are on flood plains and drainageways.  Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, siliceous, superactive, mesic Cumulic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ardlon very cobbly fine sandy loam, on a south facing, 3 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 6,060 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    The surface is covered by 30 percent rounded cobbles.

(3 to 10 inches thick)

    Bk2--29 to 40 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely cobbly loamy sand, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, common fine, few medium and coarse roots; many very fine, common fine interstitial and tubular pores; 30 percent gravel, 30 percent cobble, 15 percent stone; matrix is noneffervescent with common 1 mm thick coatings of calcium carbonate on the lower surfaces of rock fragments; gradual wavy boundary.

    Bk3--40 to 60 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) extremely cobbly sand, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, few fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine, few fine interstitial pores; 30 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles, 20 percent stones; matrix is noneffervescent with common less than 1 mm thick coatings of calcium carbonate on the lower surfaces of rock fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).  (combined thickness of Bk2 and Bk3 horizons are 28 to 31 inches)

TYPE LOCATION:  Uintah County, Utah; about 0.7 miles east of Whiterocks; located about 400 feet west and 2,000 feet south of the northeast corner of sec. 19, T. 1 N., R. 1 E., USBM; Whiterocks, Utah USGS quad; lat. 40 degrees 28 minutes 16 seconds N. and long. 109 degrees 55 minutes 02 seconds W., NAD 27

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture:  The soil moisture control section is affected by precipitation that falls evenly through the year with a slight increase in late summer and early fall.  Aridic moisture regime bordering on ustic.
Mean annual soil temperature:  47 to 51 degrees F.
Depth to redoximorphic concentrations:  11 to 17 inches  
Depth to endosaturation:  40 to 60 inches during the months of March to July

Particle-size control section:  5 to 10 percent clay and 35 to 80 percent rock fragments (rounded gravel, cobbles and stones of sedimentary and metamorphic lithology).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are no competing series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  alluvium derived from sedimentary and quartzite rocks
Landform:  flood plains and drainageways
Slopes:  1 to 3 percent

Mean annual air temperature:  45 to 49 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  8 to 12 inches
Frost-free period:  110 to 140 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Hazmaz, Heapo, Hominy, Robido, and Uver series.  

Hazmaz, Heapo, Hominy, and Uver soils do not have mollic epipedons.

Robido soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control sections.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  moderately well drained, very low runoff, moderately rapid permeability.  These soils are rarely to occasionally flooded for brief periods during the months of March to July.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major uses are rangeland and irrigated pasture.  The potential native plant vegetation consists of ill scented sumac, basin big sagebrush, needleandthread, western wheatgrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, and Indian ricegrass.  This soil is correlated to Semidry Stream Terrace (Basin Big Sagebrush- Squawbush) - 034XY014UT range site at the type location in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeast Utah.  LRR D, MLRA 34.  This series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Uintah County, Uintah Area Soil Survey, Utah. 1998.  The name is coined.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (???)
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 21 inches.  (A, ABk)
Redoximorphic features:  The presence of redox concentrations in the zone from 11 to 29 inches.  (???)
Endosaturation: The presence saturated zone at 4 to 6 feet during the months of March to July.

Taxonomic version:  Eighth Edition, 1998.

The surface texture modifier was determined following the guidelines outlined in the Utah document, "Procedures for Distributing Rock Fragments on the Surface Layer into the Upper 6 inches of Soil and Subsequent Naming of Map Units, April 1979."

ADDITIONAL DATA:  These soils have been correlated to riparian sites in Utah.  The particle-size classification was based on the weighted average of the 10 to 40 inch control section.  The cation exchange activity class was inferred from laboratory data in the Uintah Area Soil Survey.
