AGRA SERIES

The Agra series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in material weathered from shale or clay, of Pennsylvanian age.  These soils are on convex interfluves and side slopes of hillslopes on low hills in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A).  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 890 mm (35 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, thermic Udertic Paleustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Agra silt loam, on a southeast facing convex slope of 1 percent, in tame pasture at an elevation of 280 m (920 ft).  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  Ap--0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 in); brown (7.5YR 5/2) silt loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak very fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  

  A--18 to 28 cm (7 to 11 in); brown (7.5YR 4/2) silt loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable; slightly acid, clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizon is 18 to 36 cm [7 to 14 in])

  Bt--28 to 41 cm (11 to 16 in); brown (7.5YR 5/2) silty clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  

  Btss1--41 to 76 cm (16 to 30 in); brown (7.5YR 5/4) silty clay, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; very hard, very firm; common distinct brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay films on faces of peds; few distinct slickensides; neutral; gradual smooth boundary. 

  Btss2--76 to 107 cm (30 to 42 in); light brown (7.5YR 6/4) silty clay, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm; many distinct brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay films on faces of peds; few fine black manganese concentrations; common fine distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), brown (7.5YR 5/4) and light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) redoximorphic concentrations of iron; common distinct slickensides; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 51 to 127 cm [20 to 50 in])

  Btkss--107 to 203 cm (42 to 80 in); variegated gray (N 6/ ), pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2), light brown (7.5YR 6/4), and reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) silty clay; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; common distinct slickensides; few fine black manganese concentrations; few fine calcium carbonate concretions; moderately alkaline.
