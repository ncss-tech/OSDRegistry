ANSPING SERIES

The Ansping series consists of well drained soils that are deep to a strongly cemented duripan.  These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived mainly from limestone, but also from other sedimentary and volcanic rocks.  Ansping soils are on lower mountain side slopes and erosional fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, frigid Aridic Calcixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ansping loam--woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 20 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (13 to 25 cm thick)

    A2--20 to 33 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores 10 percent gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (5 to 18 cm thick)

       Bkq1--33 to 81 cm; white (10YR 8/1) very gravelly loam, light gray (10YR 7/2) moist; massive; hard, firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; very few fine roots; few very fine and fine interstitial pores; 55 percent carbonate coated gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (38 to 60 cm thick)

    Bkq2--81 to 109 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist; massive; hard, firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; 55 percent carbonate-coated gravel; very weakly cemented with carbonate and silica; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (20 to 36 cm thick)

    Bqkm--109 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) strongly cemented duripan; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist; massive; extremely hard, very firm; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  Eureka County, Nevada; about 8 miles southwest of Eureka; about 2,600 feet east and 450 feet south of the northwest corner of section 15, T. 18 N., R. 52 E.; USGS Spring Valley Summit 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 26 minutes 20 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 06 minutes 15 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.4388889 latitude, -116.1041667 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry; moist in winter and spring; dry mid July through October; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.
Carbonates:  40 to 60 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.
Thickness of mollic epipedon and depth to calcic horizon: 25 to 334 cm.
Depth to the weakly cemented Bkq horizon: 25 to 40 cm.
Depth to the strongly cemented duripan: 100 to 150 cm.
Other features: Strongly cemented duripan is lacking in some pedons.

Particle-size control section - Clay:  12 to 25 percent 
Rock fragments:  50 to 75 percent mainly gravel.

A horizon
Hue:  7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y.
Value:  4 or 5 dry.
Structure:  Platy, granular, subangular blocky.

Bkq horizon
Value:  6 through 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist.
Chroma:  1 through 3.
Texture:  Very gravelly loam, extremely gravelly loam, very gravelly sandy loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bartine, Ekim and Sanfelipe series.  

Bartine and Ekim soils have bedrock at 50 to 100 cm. Sanfelipe soils lack a strongly cemented hardpan within 150 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ansping soils are on lower mountain side slopes and footslopes; and erosional remnants of fan piedmonts.  These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived mainly from limestone, but also from some other sedimentary and volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 1,985 to 2,445 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Drewing, Fanu, Hymas, Loza, and Nuc soils.  Drewing and Loza soils are shallow to a duripan.  Fanu soils have mixed mineralogy and a fine-loamy particle-size control section.  Hymas soils are shallow to bedrock.  Nuc soils lack a mollic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Woodland, rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly singleleaf pinyon and Utah juniper with an understory of big sagebrush and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North and East-Central Nevada.  These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28B

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Nye County, Nevada, 1974.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from the soil surface to 33 cm (A1 and A2 horizons).
Calcic horizon:  The zone from about 33 to 50 cm (Bkq1 and Bkq2 horizons).
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Bkq1 and parts of the A2 and Bkq2 horizons).

The type location was moved to Eureka County in February, 2012 to better represent the series concept.
