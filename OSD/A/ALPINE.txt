ALPINE SERIES

The Alpine series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. Alpine soils are on fan remnants and stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 406 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

Parent material: mixed alluvium
Mean annual air temperature: 2.5 to 6.7 degrees C 
Mean annual precipitation: 305 to 787 mm 
Frost free period: 40 to 70 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Badgerton, Driggs, Grantsdale, and St. Anthony series. Badgerton soils are on adjacent floodplains, do not have a calcic horizon, and have a cryic soil temperature regime. Driggs soils are on slightly lower positions of fan remnants and have an argillic horizon. Grantsdale soils are on convex higher areas of fan remnants and have a coarse-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal particle size class. St. Anthony soils are in concave swales on stream terraces and do not have a calcic horizon. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class: well drained
Runoff: low 
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: low in the upper part and high in the lower part 

USE AND VEGETATION: Major uses: irrigated areas are used primarily for small grains, potatoes, hay and pasture; nonirrigated areas are used for pasture and range. Range/ecological site: R013XY002ID. Dominant native vegetation: mountain big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, antelope bitterbrush, western wheatgrass, eriogonum
