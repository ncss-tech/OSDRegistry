ALTMAN SERIES

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Gothic, Jerry, Judy, Little Horn, Mayoworth, Owen Creek, Parlin, Piltz, Sneffels, Tobincreek series.
The Gothic soils have a udic moisture regime that borders ustic. This separation is not clear; Gothic soils have vegetation characteristic of cooler and more moist conditions, but may actually be in an ustic regime.
The Jerry  and Parlin soils have accumulations of secondary carbonate.
The Judy, Little Horn, Mayoworth, Owen Creek, Piltz, Sneffels, and Tobincreek soils have a lithic or paralithic contact between 20 and 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  alluvium
Landform:  remnant terrace
Slopes:  8 to 40 percent
Elevation:  9,000 to 9,400 feet
Mean annual air temperature: 37 to 42 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  15 to 23 inches
Precipitation pattern:  Monthly precipitation is lowest in winter and greatest in July and August.
Frost-free period:  50 to 80 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cowd, Seitz, and Tellura series.  The Cowd soils do not have a thick dark surface horizon.  The Seitz and Tellura soils have greater than 35 percent rock fragments.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  well drained, highhigh slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for livestock grazing  and wildlife habitat. Potential native vegetation is Arizona fescue, mountain muhly, Parry's oatgrass, blue grama, prairie junegrass, sleepygrass, slimstem muhly, and western wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Colorado; LRR E, MLRA 48A; small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Teller County, Colorado, Teller-Park soil survey area, CO, 2010. The name is from an abandoned townsite in the Cripple Creek area. When first proposed this series was named Goth.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section: The zone from 0 to 60 inches.
Particle-size control section: The zone from 15 to 35 inches. (Bt1, Bt2 horizons)
Mollic epipedon: The zone from 0 to 15 inches. (Ap, A, AB horizons)
Argillic horizon: The zone from 15 to 41 inches. (Bt1, Bt2 horizons)
Cryic temperature regime.

This series has a transition to the argillic horizon that is marginal to the Abruptic subgroup. This distinction was not identified where this soil was first mapped; a more gradual clay increase to the argillic was chosen as most typical but future work must confirm this. Smectitic mineralogy is assumed.
