ASHBRAY SERIES 

The Ashbray series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum from granite.  These soils are on mountains, hills and escarpments.  Slopes are 2 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, nonacid, frigid Lithic Ustorthents 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ashbray gravelly coarse sandy loam, very bouldery, in woodland, (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--1/2 inch to 0; partially decomposed needles, twigs and leaves. 

    A--0 to 4 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and common fine interstitial pores; 30 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 5 inches thick) 

    C--4 to 14 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; 50 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (7 to 10 inches thick) 

    Cr--14 to 17 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) decomposed granitic bedrock (grus) that crushes to very gravelly coarse sand; neutral (pH 6.8). (0 to 5 inches thick) 

    R--17 inches; hard granite bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Jefferson County, Montana; 1900 feet north and 2175 feet east of the SW corner of section 17, T. 4 N., R. 3 W. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil Temperature - 38 to 44 degrees F 

Moisture control section - between 4 and 12 inches, or between 4 inches and the lithic contact if bedrock is less than 12 inches deep. 

Depth to Cr horizon - 8 to 18 inches. 

Depth to bedrock - 12 to 20 inches. 

Surface stones or boulders - 0 to 30 percent. 


A horizon - Value:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist 

Chroma:  2, 3 or 4 

Clay content:  10 to 20 percent 

Rock fragments:  15 to 35 percent--0 to 10 percent cobbles and stones, 15 to 50 percent pebbles

Reaction:  pH  6.1 to 7.3 


C horizon - Value:  6 or 7 dry; 5, 6 or 7 moist 

Chroma:  2, 3 or 4 

Clay content:  5 to 18 percent 

Rock fragments:  15 to 60 percent--0 to 10 percent cobbles and stones, 15 to 50 percent pebbles

Reaction: pH 6.1 to 7.3 

A BC horizon is allowed. 

COMPETING SERIES: 

Ashbon (MT) - contains coarse fragments consisting dominantly of breccia; formed in residuum from volcanic mudflow breccia; is well drained. 

Valto (CO) - contains 30 to 70 percent stones and cobbles; has lithic contact of sandstone; is well drained. 

Zbart (MT) - has lithic contact at 5 to 10 inches. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 

Landform - mountains, hills and escarpments. 

Elevation - 4,500 to 6,000 feet. 

Slope - 2 to 70 percent. 

Parent material - residuum derived from granite or other coarse grained igneous rocks. 

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers. 

Mean annual precipitation - 15 to 19 inches. 

Mean annual temperature - 36 to 42 degrees F. 

Frost-free period - 70 to 105 days. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  somewhat excessively drained,  moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Ashbray soils are primarily used for  woodland, understory grazing and for watershed.  The potential native vegetation is mainly  Douglas-fir and limber pine with an understory of common juniper, Rocky Mountain juniper, big sagebrush, Idaho fescue, prairie junegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Sandberg bluegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Ashbray soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Jefferson County, Montana, 1998. 

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT3096, MT3097, MT3098. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the mineral surface to  4 inches (A horizon); a particle size control section from the surface to 14 inches (A and C horizons); a layer of decomposed granite (grus) from 14 to 17 inches (Cr horizon);  hard granite bedrock at 17 inches (R horizon).  Ashbray soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
