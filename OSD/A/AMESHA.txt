AMESHA SERIES 

The Amesha series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvium or colluvium derived from mixed sources.  These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans, fan remnants, hills or escarpments.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Calciustepts 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Amesha loam, cultivated (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Ap--0 to 4 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 5 percent gravel; disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick) 

    Bk1--4 to 10 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; many fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; common fine masses of calcium carbonate; continuous distinct calcium carbonate casts on undersides of gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick) 

    Bk2--10 to 28 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist; weak coarse blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; few fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; many large masses of calcium carbonate; continuous distinct calcium carbonate coatings on gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 18 inches thick) 

    Bk3--28 to 49 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak coarse blocky structure separating to weak fine platy; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots and pores; 5 percent gravel; few masses of calcium carbonate; continuous distinct calcium carbonate coatings on gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (12 to 27 inches thick) 

    BCk--49 to 74 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 15 percent gravel; common faint calcium carbonate coatings on gravel; disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).
