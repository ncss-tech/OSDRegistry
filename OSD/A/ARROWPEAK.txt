ARROWPEAK SERIES

The Arrowpeak series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or residuum derived from igneous and argillite rocks.  These soils are on mountain slopes, ridges and cuestas.  Slopes are 4 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Lithic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Arrowpeak very cobbly loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 8 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very cobbly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong fine and medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine, and few medium roots; 20 percent gravel and 30 percent cobbles, few surface stones; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw--8 to 17 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely cobbly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine, very fine, and few medium roots; many very fine tubular and irregular pores; 40 percent gravel and 30 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 14 inches thick)

    R--17 inches; hard, fractured igneous bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - mountain slopes, ridges and cuestas
Elevation - 4,400 to 8,400 feet
Slope - 4 to 70 percent
Parent material - colluvium or residuum derived from igneous and argillite rocks
Climate - cool with long, cold winters; moist springs; cool summers
Mean annual precipitation - 20 to 35 inches
Mean annual air temperature - 34 to 42 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 30 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Arrowpeak soils are used mainly for rangeland and as wildlife habitat.  The potential native vegetation is mainly rough fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, Columbia needlegrass, Idaho fescue, slender wheatgrass, bearded wheatgrass, big bluegrass, spike trisetum, serviceberry, and common chokecherry.  Some areas have sparse stands of limber pine and Douglas fir.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Arrowpeak soils are of minor extent in mountain ranges in north-central and southwestern Montana. MLRA 43B.
