ASCALON SERIES

The Ascalon series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in moderate coarse textured calcareous material.  Ascalon soils are on upland hillslopes and tableland plains. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 41 centimeters (16 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (49 degrees F) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Argiustolls
