ANCENEY SERIES

The Anceney series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium or colluvium.  These soils are on escarpments, alluvial fans and relict stream terraces.  Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Entic Haplustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Anceney cobbly loam, in rangeland (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 6 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) cobbly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; 15 percent pebbles, 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.

    AB--6 to 10 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots; 20 percent pebbles, 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of A and AB horizons is 7 to 12 inches).

    Bk1--10 to 23 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; 30 percent pebbles, 15 percent cobbles; few fine masses and seams of lime; common distinct lime coatings on underside of rock fragments; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual wavy boundary.

    Bk2-- 23 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very cobbly loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; 30 percent pebbles, 25 percent cobbles; common distinct lime coatings on underside of rock fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0). (Combined thickness of Bk horizons is 40 to 60 inches).

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Gallatin County, Montana, 1997.

REMARKS: Soil interpretation record: MT1442. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 10 inches (A, AB horizons); a calcic horizon from 10 to 60 inchedds (Bk1, Bk2 horizons); a particle size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bk1, Bk2 horizons). Anceney soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
