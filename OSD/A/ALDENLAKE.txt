ALDENLAKE SERIES 

The Aldenlake series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in a loamy mantle and the underlying glacial outwash.  These soils are on outwash plains, moraines, eskers and drumlins.  Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C. and the mean annual precipitation is about 750 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, isotic, frigid Dystric Eutrudepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Aldenlake sandy loam with a linear slope of 4 percent on an outwash plain under a mixed hardwood and coniferous forest. Elevation of about 438 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 13 centimeters; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) sandy loam, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; moderate medium granular structure; friable; many fine and very fine and common medium roots; about 5 percent gravel and 2 percent cobbles; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. (5 to 15 centimeters thick)

    Bw1--13 to 51 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 4/4) sandy loam; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine and very fine and common medium roots; about 10 percent gravel and 1 percent cobbles; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

    Bw2--51 to 86 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 4/3) sandy loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine and few medium roots; about 12 percent gravel and 2 percent cobbles; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bw horizons is 46 to 86 centimeters)

    2BC--86 to 99 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 4/4) very gravelly loamy sand; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; very friable; common fine and very fine roots; about 40 percent gravel; about 3 percent cobbles; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 30 centimeters thick)

    2C--99 to 203 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 4/4) very gravelly sand; single grain; loose; about 50 percent gravel; about 4 percent cobbles; slightly acid.

TYPE LOCATION: Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) 93A-Superior Stony and Rocky Loamy Plains and Hills, Western Part; St. Louis County, Minnesota (Duluth subset); about 16 miles north of Duluth; located about 1,400 feet east and 150 feet north of the southwest corner of section 18, T. 52 N., R. 14 W.; USGS Fredenberg Quadrangle, latitude 46 degrees 58 minutes 55 seconds N. and longitude 92 degrees 10 minutes 10 seconds W., NAD 27.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ahmeek, Linneus and Mesaba series
Ahmeek--have a densic contact within the series control section
Linneus--have limestone, calcareous sandstone or shale at depths of 51 to 102 centimeters
Mesaba--have gabbro, basalt, or granite bedrock at depths of 51 to 102 centimeters

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Aldenlake soils have linear to convex slopes on outwash plains, moraines, eskers and drumlins. They formed in a loamy mantle and the underlying glacial outwash. The material is from the Rainy Lobe, or the Superior Lobe or is mixed from both sources and is of the Late Wisconsinan glaciation. Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 2 to 7 degrees C. and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 635 to 865 millimeters. Annual frost free days range from 110 to 185 days. The elevation above sea level ranges from 185 to 640 meters.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Gnesen, Rollins, Pequaywan and Hulligan soils. The somewhat excessively drained Rollins soils are in areas with a thinner loamy mantle. The moderately well drained Pequaywan, somewhat poorly drained Gnesen, and the poorly and very poorly drained Hulligan soils are all on lower lying or less sloping positions on the landscape.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--Well drained--frequent saturation does not occur within a depth of 2.0 meters during the wettest period of normal years
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--4.23 to 42.34 micrometers per second (0.6 to 6.0 inches per hour) in the loamy mantle and 42.34 to 423.4 micrometers per second (6.0 to 60 inches per hour) in the underlying sediment

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for timber production. Native vegetation is mixed deciduous and coniferous forest. Major tree species are quaking aspen, paper birch, sugar maple, red and white pine.  Some areas are pastured.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Physiographic Divisions--Laurentian Upland or Interior Plains
Physiographic Provinces--Superior Upland or Central Lowland
Physiographic sections--undefined (if in the Superior Upland Province) or Western Lake section (if in the Central Lowland Province)
MLRAs--Superior Stony and Rocky Loamy Plains and Hills, Western Part (93A) and Wisconsin and Minnesota Thin Loess and Till, Northern Part (90A)
LRR K; Northeastern Minnesota
Extent--moderate
