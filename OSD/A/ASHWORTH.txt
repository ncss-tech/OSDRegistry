ASHWORTH SERIES 

The Ashworth series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over calcareous loamy till or outwash.  These soils are on moraines, hills, and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

Potential native vegetation is mainly Douglas fir, western larch, lodgepole pine, grand fir, Engelmann spruce, western hemlock, and subalpine fir. Understory vegetation is dwarf huckleberry, twinflower, rusty menziesia, common beargrass, blue huckleberry, grouse whortleberry, and pinegrass.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Flathead County, Montana 1997. 

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretation Record:  MT1616.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ash influenced layer from 1 to 11 inches (A, Bw horizons); an ochric epipedon from 1 to 21 inches (A, Bw, and 2E horizons); an albic horizon from 11 to 21 inches (2E horizon); accumulation of carbonates from 21 to 51 inches (2Bk1, 2Bk2 horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches below the mineral soil surface (2E, 2Bk1, 2Bk2 horizons).  Ashworth soils have a udic moisture regime and a cryic temperature regime. 

The 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Andic Eutrocryepts to Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Andic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.
