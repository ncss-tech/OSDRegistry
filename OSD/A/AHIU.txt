AHIU SERIES

The Ahiu series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils that formed in basic volcanic ash deposited over basic pahoehoe lava. Slopes range from 2 to 10 percent. The mean annual rainfall is about 760 mm (30 inches), and the mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C. (66 degrees F.)

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy, amorphic, isothermic Lithic Haplustands

TYPICAL PEDON: Ahiu ashy silt loam, 5 percent slope under scattered `ohi`a trees with a grass understory at an elevation of 820 meters (2,700 feet). (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted. When described on 2/27/98 the soil was slightly moist throughout. The soil temperature was 17 degrees C. (63 degrees F.) at a depth of 20 centimeters (8 inches). All textures are "apparent field textures". pH was measured using electrode in 1:1 water.)

(3 to 13 centimeters (1 to 5 inches) thick)

  Bw--8 to 15 centimeters (3 to 6 inches); black (10YR 2/1) ashy silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; slightly acid (pH 6.5); abrupt wavy boundary.

  C--15 to 28 centimeters (6 to 11 inches); alternating layers of ashy fine sand and ashy loamy fine sand 3 to 5 centimeters (1 to 2 inches) thick; colors are lithochromic light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3), very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) dry, and lithochromic olive brown (2.5Y 4/4), very dark brown (10YR 2/2) dry; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; at 25 centimeters (10 inches) depth there are 0.6 centimeter (1/4 inch) thick moderately hard, friable, non-cemented plates; brittle, nonsticky and nonplastic and break down to loamy fine sand; neutral (pH 7.1); abrupt wavy boundary. (3 to 18 centimeters (1 to 7 inches) thick)

  2A--28 to 30 centimeters (11 to 12 inches); black (10YR 2/1) ashy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) dry; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; neutral (pH 7.1); abrupt broken boundary. (0 to 5 centimeters (0 to 2 inches) thick)

  2Bw--30 to 33 centimeters (12 to 13 inches); very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) ashy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) dry; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; neutral (pH 7.3); abrupt broken boundary. (0 to 5 centimeters (0 to 2 inches) thick)

  3R--33 centimeters (13 inches); hard basic pahoehoe lava.

TYPE LOCATION: Hawaii Volcanoes National Park; from Crater Rim Drive travel 2.2 miles southeast (downhill) on Chain of Craters Road, then 8.1 miles southwest on Hilina Pali road; park on north side of road; walk at a heading of 270 degrees magnetic for approximately 74 meters (240 feet) to type location; Ka`u Desert Quadrangle; lat. 19 degrees 18 minutes 14.97 seconds N. and long. 155 degrees 18 minutes 31.08 seconds W.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Kahaumanu and Nanaia series. Kahaumanu soils are moist in the control section from January through July. Nanaia soils have a mollic epipedon and do not have buried horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ahiu soils are on Kilauea pahoehoe flows mainly 400 to 1,500 years old, at elevations of 515 to 915 meters (1,700 to 3,000 feet). Slopes range from 2 to 10 percent. The mean annual rainfall is 635 to 890 millimeters (25 to 35 inches), about 80 percent of which falls between August and April. The mean annual pan evaporation is 2,030 to 2,285 millimeters (80 to 90 inches). The mean annual air temperature is 18 to 21 degrees C. (64 to 70 degrees F.). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kanohina, Nakanui, Lithic Haplustands, Vitric Haplustands, and Lithic Ustipsamments soils. Kanohina soils are isohyperthermic. Nakanui soils are medial and have 15 to 60 percent gravel in the subsoil. Lithic Haplustands have coarse loamy and sandy control section. Vitric Haplustands have more than 60 percent coarse fragments throughout the control section. Lithic Ustipsamments have a sandy control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Runoff is very high. Permeability is rapid in the soil and very slow in the underlying pahoehoe bedrock.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for National Park Service land. Vegetation is `akia (Wikstroemia phillyreifolia), `a`ali`i (Dodonaea viscosa), bamboo orchid (Arundina graminifolia), broomsedge (Andropogon virginicus), bushy beardgrass (Schizachyrium condensatum), firetree or faya tree (Myrica faya), molassesgrass (Melinis minutiflora), `ohi`a lehua (Metrosideros polymorpha), pukiawe (Styphelia tameiameiae), thatchinggrass (Hyparrhenia rufa), and sour bush (Pluchea symphytifolia).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: These soils are within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park; MLRA 161. The series is of small extent.
