ALLENTINE SERIES

The Allentine series consists of very deep, well-drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Gilt Edge series.  Gilt Edge soils have an E horizon more than 5 inches thick.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Allentine soils are on terraces.  Elevations range from 2,500 to 4,000 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 110 to 140 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow or medium runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Allentine soils are used mainly as rangeland and for dryland and irrigated crops.  Potential native vegetation is mainly western wheatgrass, green needlegrass, and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Allentine soils are of moderate extent in south central Montana.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Denver, Colorado.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Big Horn County (Big Horn Area), Montana, 1970.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizon features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 10 inches (Ap horizon); argillic horizon - the zone from 10 to 23 inches (Bt and Btk horizon); particle-size control section - zone from 10 to 23 inches (Bt and Btk horizons).  The Btk horizon has more exchangeable magnesium plus sodium than calcium plus acidity (pH 8.2). 

It appears this series has been mapped in frigid areas and may fit better in that regime.  This determination will be made as surveys are updated.  Competing series in the frigid regime would include the Gerdrum, Loburn, Thoeny and Weingart series.  These soils have an SAR of more than 10 in the Bt horizons.  In addition Thoeny soils formed in till and have more rock fragments and a bulk density to more than 1.55 within a depth of 40 inches and Weingart soils are moderately deep to beds.
