ANTENNAPEAK SERIES

Antennapeak series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from welded tuff. Antennapeak soils are on mountain back slopes.  Slopes are 8 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 600 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Vitrandic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Antennapeak gravelly ashy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered with 10 percent gravels.

    A1--0 to 8 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly ashy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 15 percent gravels; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 12 cm thick)

    A2--8 to 84 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) very gravelly ashy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; 30 percent gravels and 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); clear smooth boundary. (35 to 80 cm thick)

    ABk--84 to 120 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly ashy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; common (3 percent) fine, faint, platy calcium carbonate concretions on the bottom of rock fragments; 30 percent gravels and 10 percent cobbles; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); gradual wavy boundary. (15 to 50 cm thick)

    Cr--120 to 152 cm; moderately cemented, fractured welded tuff.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lincoln County, Nevada; on Mount Wilson 500 meters east of Mount Wilson peak; USGS Mount Wilson 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 15 minutes 22.2 seconds N and longitude 114 degrees 21 minutes 17.0 seconds W; UTM zone 11, 0731458e, 4237549n; NAD83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually moist in winter, spring, and early summer, dry in all parts at least 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice (July and August), but intermittently moist in the upper part for 10 to 20 days cumulative due to convection storms between July and September; typic xeric soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 4 to 7 degrees C.
Mean summer soil temperature: 7 to 15 degrees C. 
Mollic epipedon thickness: 100 to 120 cm. 
Depth to secondary calcium carbonates: 50 to 100 cm.
Depth to paralithic contact: 100 to 150 cm.
Calcium carbonate development stage: Stage I.
Mineralogy: 24 to 30 percent volcanic glass in the 0.02 to 2.0 mm fraction and 0.1 to 0.2 percent aluminum plus  iron extracted by ammonium oxalate.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 18 to 27 percent; 
Rock fragments: 35 to 60 percent, mainly gravel.  Lithology of fragments is welded tuff.

A1 horizon
Value: 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist. 

A2 horizon
Value: 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Consistence: Soft or slightly hard, and nonplastic or slightly plastic.
Rock fragments: 35 to 50 percent mainly gravels.

ABk horizon
Value 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3 dry and moist.
Rock fragments: 35 to 60 percent mainly gravels.
Structure: moderate medium subangular blocky structure or massive.
Effervescence: noneffervescent in the matrix and strongly effervescent on bottom of rock fragments. 
Calcium carbonate equivalence: 0 to 2 percent in the less than 2 mm fraction.

Cr horizon
Other: some pedons have few calcium carbonate accumulations on rock fractures.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Antennapeak soils are on slightly concave, mountain backslopes. These soils formed in colluvium derived from welded tuff. Slopes are 8 to 30 percent. Elevations range from 2,400 to 2,750 meters. The climate is moist-subhumid with cold wet winters and warm dry summers that receive an increase in moisture during the winter from wind blown snow. Antennapeak soils accumulate wind blown snow from mountain ridges. The mean annual precipitation is 450 to 700 mm, mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 40 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Nevtah, Wiltop, Winu, and Winz soils. Nevtah soils do not have calcium carbonate accumulations in the profile. Wiltop soils average 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Winu soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and a lithic contact between 50 to 100 cm. Winz soils have a mean annual summer soil temperature 7 to 8 degrees C. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very high surface runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Antennapeak soils are used for livestock grazing, and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, low sagebrush, and snowberry. Freezing at some depth and/or prolonged spring saturation from snowmelt may be preventing growth of mountain big sagebrush on most sites. This pedon is correlated to ecological site number R028AY061NV, Claypan 14+ P.Z.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28A.
