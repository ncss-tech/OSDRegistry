ADAVEN SERIES

The Adaven series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in sediments derived from mixed rocks and pyroclastic material. Adaven soils are on floodplains and toe slopes of fan piedmonts. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Adaven soils occur on smooth, nearly level toe of alluvial fans where they merge with wet flood plains and have slope gradients of 0 to 2 percent slopes.  They have formed in sediment from mixed sources including limestone and ignimbrite.  The sediments have been modified by evaporation of water from hot springs having a high lime content.  Elevations are 915 to 1,220 meters.  The climate is arid with a mean annual precipitation of 125 to 175 mm.  The mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C. The frost free season is about 170 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Adaven soils occur in the same general area as Ash Springs, Carrizo, Geer, Maynard Lake, Pahranagat, and Seaman.  Carrizo soils have a sandy-skeletal particle-size control section. Maynard Lake soils have sandy particle-size control sections.  Geer and Seaman soils are well drained and have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections.  Pahranagat soils are poorly drained and have mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; runoff is slow; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  The water table varies seasonally about 76 cm during most of the year and rising to within 46 cm during the winter months when the vegetation is dormant.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The soils are used for grazing.  Saltgrass is the dominant species, but in many places there are significant quantities of alkali sacaton, wiregrass, fourwing saltbush and quailbush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Valleys of southeastern Nevada and possibly southwestern Utah.  The series is inextensive. MLRA 29.
