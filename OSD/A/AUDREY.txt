TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Aquic Haplocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: AUDREY silt loam - on a slope of 5 percent under birch and blueberry scrub at 1650 feet elevation. (All colors are for moist soil unless noted)

       Oe--0 to 1 inch (0 to 3 cm); black (10YR 2/1) moderately decomposed plant material; many very fine to medium roots; moderately acid (pH 6.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 4 inches thick)

       A--1 to 8 inches (3 to 20 cm); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silt loam; weak fine granular structure; slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine to medium roots; strongly acid (pH 5.4); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 16 inches thick)

       Bw/Ajj--8 to 17 inches (20 to 43 cm); (Bw) 40 percent dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) and 20 percent dark gray (2.5Y 4/1) silt loam; weak thick platy structure; (A) and 40 percent very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silt loam; weak fine granular structure; (Bw/Ajj) friable; slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) redoximorphic features; moderately acid (pH 5.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (8 to 16 inches thick)

	2C--28 to 60 inches (71 to 153 cm); olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) very gravelly sandy loam; massive; very friable; slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 40 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6)

TYPE LOCATION: About 5 miles west of Richardson Highway; in the SE 1/4 of the SW 1/4, section 36, T. 12S., R. 9E; Mt. Hayes (D-4); 1:63,360 quad; Fairbanks Meridian; UTM north 7077800 and UTM east 554272, zone 6.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Mean annual soil temperature: about 33 degrees F., 0.5 C.
Thickness of organic materials: 1 to 4 inches, 2.5 to 10 cm
Thickness of silty loess mantle: 16 to 32 inches, 40 to 81 cm
All soil colors are moist unless otherwise noted.

O horizon:
Matrix color: hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 2 to 3; chroma of 1 to 2
Texture: Slightly or moderately decomposed plant material
Reaction class: very strongly acid to moderately acid

A horizon:
Matrix color: value of 2 to 3; chroma of 1 to 2
Reaction class: very strongly acid to moderately acid

Bw horizon:
Matrix color: hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 3 to 5; chroma of 1 to 6
Texture: silt loam or very fine sandy loam
Coarse fragments: 0 to 10 percent gravel
Reaction class: moderately acid or slightly acid

2BC horizon:
Matrix color: hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 3 to 5; chroma of 3 to 5
Texture: silt loam or very fine sandy loam modified by 10 to 30 percent total coarse fragments; 10 to 30 percent gravel, 0 to 15 percent cobbles
Reaction class: modertely acid to slightly neutral 

2C horizon:
Matrix color: value of 4 or 5; chroma of 3 to 6
Texture: sandy loam or coarse sandy loam modified by 35 to 70 percent total coarse fragments; 35 to 70 percent gravel; 0 to 15 percent cobbles
Reaction class: moderately acid to neutral

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Gerstle, Kusdry, Manchu, and Stamp series. Gerstle and Kusdry soils do not have coarse fragments in the control section. Manchu soils have schist channers and flagstones. Stamp soils are somewhat poorly drained and have a mean annual soil temperature above 35 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loess over till
Landform: glacial hills 
Slope: 0 to 35 percent
Mean annual temperature: 24 to 28 degrees F., -4.4 to -2.2 C.
Mean annual precipitation: 12 to 15 inches, 305 to 380 mm

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Butchlake and Southpaw series. Butchlake and Southpaw series are well drained soils on similar landforms and have thicker loess mantles.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained, low to medium runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the silty surface soil and high in the very gravelly subsoil.

USE AND VEGETATION: The native vegetation includes birch and blueberry scrub.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 228, Interior Alaska Mountains. The series is of moderate extent.
