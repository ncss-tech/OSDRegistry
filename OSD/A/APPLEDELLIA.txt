APPLEDELLIA SERIES

The Appledellia series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium from basalt and some granite.  They are on terraces and have slopes of 2 to 30 percent.  Permeability is slow. The average annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Typic Durixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Appledellia loam--on a 2 percent slope at an elevation of 3,330 feet in rangeland.  (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.  When described on July 28, l980, the soil was dry.)

    A--0 to 10 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak very fine and fine granular structure; soft; friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; 2 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual smooth boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)

    Bt1--10 to 18 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 2 percent gravel; many prominent clay films on faces of peds; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual smooth boundary.  (2 to 12 inches thick)

    Bt2--18 to 32 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) gravelly clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel; many prominent clay films on faces of peds; neutral (pH 7.3); abrupt wavy boundary.  (10 to 16 inches thick)

    2Bqm--32 to 33 inches; thin duripan with continuous laminar surface, abrupt wavy boundary.  (1/8 to 1 inch thick)

    2C--33 to 60 inches; multicolored extremely gravelly sand; massive; slightly hard, very friable; mildly alkaline (pH 7.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  Washington County, Idaho; about 5 miles east and 3 miles north of Crane Creek reservoir; 2,200 feet west and 2,450 feet north of the southeast corner of sec. 34, T. 13 N., R. 1 W.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Graven (T) and Oxbow.  Graven soils have carbonates and lack gravel below the duripan.  Oxbow soils have a duripan that is 6 to 20 inches thick and have carbonates in the lower part of the argillic horizon and in the duripan.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTINGS:  Appledellia soils are on terraces.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  Elevation ranges from 2,500 to 3,500 feet.  The soil formed in mixed alluvium from basalt, granite, and some metamorphic rock.  The climate is mesic with average annual precipitation of 16 to 25 inches, most of which falls as snow in the winter.  The average annual air temperature is about 48 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 110 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Appleshall (T), Bakeoven, Deshler, Gem, Langrell, Meland, Midvale, Newell, Reywat, and Riggins series.  Appleshall soils have a duripan at 20 to 20 inch depths.  All other soils lack a duripan.  Bakeoven soils are very shallow to basalt.  Deshler soils are moderately deep to tuff.  Gem and Meland soils are moderately deep to basalt.  Langrell, Midvale, and Newell soils are deep.  Reywat and Riggins soils are shallow to basalt.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for hay, small grain and natural vegetation for areas not cultivated is scattered ponderosa pine in the higher precipitation areas and bunchgrasses in the lower precipitation areas.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Idaho.  The series is not extensive.
