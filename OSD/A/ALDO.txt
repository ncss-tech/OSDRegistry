ALDO SERIES

The Aldo series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in sandy outwash. These soils are on valley trains in glaciofluvial valleys.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 860 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, mesic Typic Udipsamments

TYPICAL PEDON:  Aldo sand, on a plane slope of 2 percent, in a cultivated field, at an elevation of about 260 meters above sea level.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated)

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Pepin County, Wisconsin, 1998.  The name is coined.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are: 
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 23 centimeters (Ap horizon);
udic moisture regime.

Prior to 1996, in Wisconsin, the concept of the Aldo series was included in the Brems series and the wet substratum phase of the Plainfield series (WI0380).
