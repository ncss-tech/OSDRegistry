ANNIECREEK SERIES

The Anniecreek series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic material. Anniecreek soils are on flood plains or low stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy, glassy Vitrandic Haplocryolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Anniecreek ashy fine sandy loam, woodland. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.) 

  Oi--0 to 4 inches; slightly decomposed needle mat. 

  A1--4 to 12 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) ashy fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) dry; weak medium granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; about 5 percent pumice paragravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick) 

  2A2--12 to 24 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) very gravelly ashy coarse sand, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine irregular pores; about 10 percent pumice paragravel and 40 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (10 to 25 inches thick) 

  3Ab--24 to 32 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) and very dark gray (10YR 3/1) stratified ashy fine sand and ashy sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) and light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; many fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) soft iron masses, many fine prominent black (10YR 2/1) soft manganese masses; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; about 1 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick)

  4Bg1--32 to 55 inches; black (N/2.5) ashy fine sand, dark gray (2.5Y 4/1) dry; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine irregular pores; about 5 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 25 inches thick)

  5Bg2--55 to 71 inches; black (N/2.5) very gravelly ashy coarse sand, variegated dry; common coarse distinct strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) soft iron accumulations; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine irregular pores; about 40 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8). 

TYPE LOCATION: Klamath County, Oregon; NAD 83. UTM one 10, 588757 m E., 4744114 m N. (GPS) SE 1/4, NW 1/4 Sec. 32, T. 31 S., R. 7 E. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. The average annual soil temperature ranges from 39 to 43 degrees F. The solum has 70 to 100 percent volcanic glass, 0.2 to 0.4 acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron, 10 to 25 percent phosphate retention, and 5 to 12 percent 15-bar air-dry moisture content 0 to 7 percent by field estimate. The mollic epipedon is 20 to 35 inches thick. There is an irregular decrease in organic matter with depth. The soils have a udic soil moisture regime. 

The particle-size control section averages 10 to 35 percent rock fragments.
Water table present at less than 60 inches throughout the year, with the highest water table from January to May. 
Depth to redox features and aquic conditions - 20 to 35 inches
Clay content - 0 to 15 percent 

A and 2A horizon:
Hue - 10YR through 2.5Y
Value - 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry
Chroma - 1 or 2 moist, 1 to 3 dry 

3Ab horizon:
Hue 10YR or 7.5YR
Value - 2 to 4 moist, 4 to 5 dry
Chroma - 1 to 3 moist and dry
Texture - Variable-including medial very fine sandy loam, ashy loamy coarse sand, ashy sand and ashy fine sand 

Some pedons have an AC horizon
Hue - 10YR through 2.5Y
Value - 2 to 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry
Texture - ashy fine sandy loam, ashy loamy sand and ashy sand 

4B and 5B horizon:
Hue - neutral
Value - 2.5 to 4 moist, 4 to 5 dry
Chroma - 0 to 3 moist, 2 to 4 dry
Pumice paragravel content - 0 to 20 percent
Rock fragments - 0 to 70 percent
Texture - ashy fine sand, ashy loamy sand and ashy coarse sand 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Brownsbowl and Cadero series. Cadero soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Brownsbowl soils have a xeric moisture regime. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Anniecreek soils are on nearly level flood plains or low stream terraces at an elevation of 4,100 to 5,500 feet. The soils formed in alluvium derived from volcanic materials. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and cool dry summers. The average annual precipitation is 25 to 40 inches. The average annual temperature is 40 to 42 degrees F. The frost-free period is 10 to 50 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Collier, Castlecrest and Umak soils. Collier and Castlecrest soils are ashy and are on adjacent ash flows. Umak soils are ashy-pumiceous and are on adjacent ash flows. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; occasional flooding; rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for wildlife and recreation. Vegetation consists mainly of Engleman spruce, mountain alder, lodgepole pine, sedges, and shrubs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Cascade mountains of central Oregon; MLRA 6. This series is not extensive.
