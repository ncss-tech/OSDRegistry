ARMSTRONG SERIES

The Armstrong series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in 25 to 50 centimeters of hillslope sediments or loess and in the underlying paleosol weathered from till. These soils are on side slopes and summits of interfluves on till plains. Slope ranges from 2 to 25 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 millimeters.
