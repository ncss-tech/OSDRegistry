ALBAN SERIES

The Alban series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy lacustrine deposits. These soils are on stream terraces, glacial lake plains, and delta kames. Slope ranges from 0 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 81 to 112 centimeters; series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 81 centimeters (Ap, E, and E/B horizons); 
albic horizon--the zone from a depth of 20 to 51 centimeters (E horizon); 
glossic horizon--the zone from a depth of 51 to 112 centimeters (E/B and B/E horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 81 to 112 centimeters (B/E horizon);
udic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
