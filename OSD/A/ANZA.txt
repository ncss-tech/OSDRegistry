ANZA SERIES

The Anza series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granitic and metamorphic rocks. Anza soils are on alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 320 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 14 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Pachic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Anza fine sandy loam on a north-facing slope of 2 percent at an elevation of 1400 meters under a cover of annual grasses and big sagebrush. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

  Ap--0 to 38 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak, fine, granular structure; very friable, soft, nonsticky, nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine irregular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.5); abrupt smooth boundary. (15 to 38 cm thick)   

 A1--38 to 58 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak, coarse, angular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, nonsticky, slightly plastic; many very fine and common fine roots; common fine irregular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.5); abrupt smooth boundary. (15 to 25 cm thick)

  A2--58 to 91 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate, medium, angular blocky, moderate medium angular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, nonsticky, slightly plastic; common fine roots; common fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (7 to 35 cm thick)

  C1--91 to 116 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) fine sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; friable, hard, nonsticky, nonplastic; few, fine, faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) iron-manganese masses   in matrix; common fine roots between peds; common medium irregular pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (5 to 30 cm thick)

  C2--116 to 145 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loamy sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; friable, hard, nonsticky, nonplastic; few, fine, faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) iron-manganese masses  in matix; common fine roots between peds; common fine irregular pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. 

  C3--145 to 175 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; friable, hard, nonsticky, nonplastic; few fine faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) iron-manganese masses  in matrix; few fine roots; common medium pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); slightly effervescent, abrupt wavy boundary.
