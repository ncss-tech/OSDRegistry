ANNABELLA SERIES

The Annabella series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from basic and intermediate igneous rocks and some sedimentary rocks.  Annabella soils are on fan remnants, alluvial fans, fan skirts, inset fans, fan piedmonts, landslides and base slopes of hills or mountains. Slopes are 1 to 50 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Xeric Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Annabella cobbly sandy loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for air-dry soils unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 8 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) cobbly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; common very fine and few fine pores; 10 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles and about 1 percent stones; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 20 cm thick)

    C1--8 to 36 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; few fine pores; 25 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles and about 1 percent stones; strongly effervescent matrix, with carbonate coatings on rock fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. (13 to 58 cm thick)

    C2--36 to 61 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly coarse sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; interstitial pores; 50 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; moderately strongly effervescent matrix, with carbonate coatings on rock fragments; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 30 cm thick)

    C3--61 to 97 cm; pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; 30 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent calcareous matrix with carbonate coatings on rock fragments; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary.  (25 to 38 cm thick)

    C4--97 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very cobbly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; 20 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles and about 1 percent stones; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Sevier County, Utah; 1.75 miles east of Annabella; 2,260 feet North and 1,200 feet East of southwest corner of sec. 16, T. 24 S., R. 2 W., SLBM.; USGS Annabella 7.5 minute quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 42 minutes 45 seconds N and longitude 112 degrees 1 minutes 43 seconds W; NAD 83; UTM 410,573 meters E 4,285,376 meters N, zone 12. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Soil moisture: Usually dry; intermittently moist in winter and spring, dry in summer and fall except for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October due to convection storms; aridic bordering on xeric soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 12 degrees C.  
Salinity: Non-saline through moderately saline.
Other features: Some pedons have small to moderate amounts of gypsum throughout.  

Particle-size control section- Clay content: Average 5 to 22 percent.
Rock fragments: Average 35 to 60 percent.  

A horizon 
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR.
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 to 4 moist (Values as dark as 3 moist and 5 dry extend to depths of only 13 cm or less). 
Effervescence: Slightly effervescent or strongly effervescent.

C horizons 
Hue: 5YR to 10YR.
Value: 5 to 7 dry and 3 to 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 to 4.
Texture: Stratified loam to coarse sand; sandy clay loam or clay loam in individual horizons with a range of 15 to 80 percent gravel and cobbles
Rock fragment: Average 35 to 60 percent.  
Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline. 

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Warrior and Wiffo series.  

Warrior soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 14 degrees C. and have Ck horizons. Wiffo soils are not moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October due to convection storms.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Annabella soils are at elevations of 1,520 to 2,710 meters.  Slopes are 1 to 50 percent.  The soils occur on alluvial fans, fan remnants, inset fans, fan skirts, fan piedmonts, landslides and base slopes of hills. Annabella soils formed in alluvium, slope alluvium and colluvium derived from basic and intermediate igneous and sedimentary rocks.  The climate is semiarid, the average annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm.  Mean annual air temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C, and the freeze-free period is 100 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ashdown, Bertelson, Calcross, Dixie, Hiko Peak, Monroe, and Phage soils.  Ashdown, Bertelson and Calcross soils have 0 to 20 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Dixie soils have an argillic horizon.  Bertelson, Hiko Peak and Phage soils have a calcic horizon.  Monroe soils have a mollic epipedon and are fine-loamy.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; slow or medium runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for livestock grazing, irrigated cropland and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is dominantly big sagebrush, shadscale, rabbitbrush, cheatgrass, Indian ricegrass, galleta, pinyon, Utah juniper, greasewood, cholla and snakeweed.  Irrigated crops include alfalfa and barley.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central and southwestern Utah.  MLRA 28A.  This series is moderately extensive.
