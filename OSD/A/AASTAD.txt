AASTAD SERIES

The Aastad series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in calcareous till on moraines and till plains. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 560 millimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Argiudolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Aastad clay loam on a nearly level slope in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated) 

    Ap--0 to 23 centimeters (about 0 to 9 inches); black (10YR 2/1) clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; firm; about 4 percent coarse fragments; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. 

    A--23 to 58 centimeters (about 9 to 23 inches); black (10YR 2/1) clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; firm; about 4 percent coarse fragments; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizons is 30 to 60 centimeters) 

    Bt--58 to 97 centimeters (about 23 to 38 inches); olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) clay loam; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium angular blocky; firm; common faint very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay films on faces of peds; about 4 percent coarse fragments; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 20 to 60 centimeters) 

    Bk1--97 to 127 centimeters (about 38 to 50 inches); light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) clay loam; common medium distinct grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) redoximorphic depletions and common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium angular blocky; firm; common fine masses of carbonates; about 4 percent coarse fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. 

    Bk2--127 to 163 centimeters (about 50 to 64 inches); grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay loam; many medium distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) redoximorphic concentration; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium angular blocky; firm; common fine masses of carbonates; about 5 percent coarse fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bk horizon is 20 to 64 centimeters) 

    BC--163 to 200 centimeters (about 64 to 80 inches); grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay loam; many medium distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; moderate course and extremely course prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and course angular blocky; firm; about 5 percent coarse fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Weetown series. Weetown soils have less than 28 percent clay in the particle size control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform(s): Moraines and till plains 
Parent material: Calcareous till 
Elevation: 270 to 770 meters 
Slope range: 0 to 6 percent 
Mean annual air temperatures ranges: 2 to 7 degrees C 
Mean annual precipitation: 380 to 690 millimeters 
Annual frost free season: 110 to 170 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Buse, Forman, Brensall, Tress, Balaton, Hamerly, Tonka, Vallers, and Parnell soils. The well drained Buse and Forman soils are on higher landform positions. The moderately well drained Brensall soils are on slightly higher, broad convex flats. The moderately well drained Balaton and somewhat poorly drained Hamerly soils are on lower, slightly convex landform positions. The somewhat poorly drained Tress soils are on lower, more concave landform positions. The poorly drained Vallers soils are on lower landform positions or rims of depressions. The poorly drained Tonka soils are in closed depressions. The very poorly drained Parnell soils are in closed depressions or drainageways. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. Surface runoff is low to medium depending on slope. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high, The depth to apparent seasonal high saturation is 75 to 125 centimeters at some time from March to June in normal years. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. The main crops are corn and soybeans. Native vegetation is tall grass prairie. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Minnesota, eastern North Dakota, and northeastern South Dakota. The soils are extensive.
