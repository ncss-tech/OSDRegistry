ANTIGO SERIES

The Antigo series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of loess or silty alluvium and in loamy alluvium and in the underlying stratified sandy outwash. These soils are on outwash plains, stream terraces, eskers, kames, glacial lake plains, and moraines.  Slope ranges from 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 810 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Langlade County, Wisconsin, l947.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 30 to 80 centimeters; series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon: 
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 30 centimeters (Ap and E horizons); 
albic horizon--the zone from a depth of 23 to 48 centimeters (E and E part of B/E horizon); 
glossic horizon--the zone from a depth of 30 to 48 centimeters (B/E horizon);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 30 to 84 centimeters (B/E, Bt1, 2Bt2, and 2Bt3 horizons);
lithologic discontinuity--at the upper boundary of the 2Bt2 horizon at a depth of 71 centimeters and at the upper boundary of the 3C horizon at a depth of 84 centimeters;
udic moisture regime.

Antigo soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both).  Horizonation has a wide range depending on the thickness of the silty mantle and the degree to which eluviation has occurred.  Therefore, there can be E/B, B/E, 2E/B, or 2B/E horizons, singly or in combination, with or without Bt or 2Bt horizons.

Cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data (NSSL).
