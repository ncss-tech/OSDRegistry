ALLENDORF SERIES

The Allendorf series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in 75 to 100 centimeters of loess or silty and loamy alluvium over sandy sediments.  These soils are on treads and risers on stream terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 9 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 710 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludolls

 2C1--94 to 102 centimeters; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly loamy coarse sand; single grain; loose; few very fine roots; few calcium carbonate accumulations; about 50 percent rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.

 2C2--102 to 152 centimeters; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly sand; single grain; loose; few very fine roots in the upper part; about 30 percent rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.
