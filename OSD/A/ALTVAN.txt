ALTVAN SERIES

The Altvan series consists of moderately deep to sand or gravelly sand, well drained soils.  They formed in loamy sediments on uplands hillslopes and valley terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 41 centimeters (16 inches), and mean annual temperature is 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Altvan loam - on less than 1 percent slope in a cultivated field.  When described the soil was moist to a depth of 58 centimeters (23 inches).  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

Chappell soils are on foot slopes.
Dix soils are shallow, sandy-skeletal, and are mainly on steep side slopes
Eckley soils have gravelly sand at a depth of 25 to 64 centimeters (10 to 20 inches)
Keith soils are very deep, fine-silty and on similar landscapes
Rosebud soils are on similar landscapes
Satanta soils are very deep, fine-loamy and on similar landscapes
Tripp soils are very deep, coarse-silty, do not have an argillic horizon, and are on similar high stream terraces and in a few places on uplands
 
DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage: well drained.  
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: high in the solum and very rapid in the 2C horizon
Runoff: slow on nearly level slopes, medium on the gentle slopes and rapid on moderately steep slopes

USE AND VEGETATION: Soils are generally cultivated except on the steeper slopes.  Dryland crops are wheat, corn, grain sorghum, millet, and spring-sown small grains.  
Irrigated crops are corn, alfalfa, sugar beets, and field beans.  
The native vegetation species are western wheatgrass, needleandthread, blue grama, thread leaf sedge, little bluestem, and buffalograss.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Altvan soils are extensive in western Nebraska and adjacent areas of Colorado, Wyoming, and South Dakota.
