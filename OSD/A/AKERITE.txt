REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features in this pedon
*Ochric epipedon
*Cambic horizon--zone from 3 to 94 cm
*Alfic feature and argillic horizon--zone from the mineral soil surface to a depth of 155 cm
*Aquic feature--zone from 79 to 117 cm; redoximorphic concentrations
*Volcanic glass--zone from 33 to 94 cm
*Particle-size control section--zone from 3 to 103 cm

Akerite soils are in areas where frost pockets delay the onset of the growing season and encourage growth of hardy trees in winter.
