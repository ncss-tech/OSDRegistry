GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Aztalan soils are on glacial lake basins and stream terraces.  Slope  ranges from 0 to 6 percent.  These soils formed in a mantle of loamy outwash and in mostly silty and clayey  stratified lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 660 to 890 mm (26  to 35 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.8 to 10.0 degrees C (46 to 50 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Kibbie, Martinton, and Navan soils.  The poorly drained and very poorly drained Navan soils form a drainage sequence with Aztalan soils and are the most common associates in the nearly level and gently undulating landscapes.  Aztalan, Kibbie, and Martinton are soils often associated in the landscape but cannot be identified with or separated one from another by specific relief; consequently, all reflect the varying influences of stratification and overwash.  Kibbie soils formed in thinly stratified silty and very fine sandy deposits, whereas Martinton soils formed in stratified silty and clayey deposits.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat poorly drained. Surface runoff is medium or low.   Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the loamy outwash mantle and moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers per second) in the underlying lacustrine deposits. Permeability is moderate in the loamy outwash mantle and moderately slow in the underlying stratified lacustrine deposit. These soil have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 31 to 76 cm (1 to 2.5 feet) for some time in most years.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Much of this soil  is used for cropland. Common crops are corn, small grains, and hay. Native vegetation is prairie grasses with a few trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  MLRAs 95B and 110 in southeastern Wisconsin.  The Aztalan soils are of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Walworth County, Wisconsin, 1966.

REMARKS:  
7/04  The concept of this series is a mantle of loamy outwash over silty and clayey stratified lacustrine deposits. In some county surveys, soils that formed in loamy outwash over clayey till have also been correlated as Aztalan. This includes at least part of the acreage of Aztalan in the Kenosha-Racine and Ozaukee soil surveys and possibly the Milwaukee-Waukesha and other surveys. These areas need to be correlated to another (new?) series when the surveys are updated.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon -  0 to 31 cm (0 to 12 inches) (AP and A ); argillic horizon - 31 to 109 cm (12 to 43 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, 2Bt3, and 2Bt4); aquic feature  redox features and saturation within 16 inches of the surface.
