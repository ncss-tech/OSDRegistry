ANVIL SERIES

The Anvil series consists of very deep, moderately well  drained soils formed in high energy alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Anvil soils are in ephemeral drainages and small creek bottoms.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Oxyaquic Torrifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Anvil loam -- on a southeast facing slope of one percent, utilized as rangeland.  (Colors are for a dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

A1--0 to 2 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak very fine granular structure;  soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, few fine, medium, and coarse roots; common very fine continuous random irregular pores; strongly effervescent, calcium carbonate disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.

A2--2 to 5 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak medium and coarse granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine, few fine, medium, and coarse roots; common very fine and fine continuous random irregular pores; strongly effervescent, calcium carbonate disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the A horizon is 4 to 9 inches)

C1--5 to 15 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine, few fine, medium, and coarse roots; common very fine and  fine continuous random irregular pores; 16 percent gravel;  strongly effervescent, calcium carbonate disseminated; moderately  alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.

2C2--15 to 33 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) extremely cobbly coarse sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; 40 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent, calcium carbonate disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).  clear wavy boundary.

3C3--33 to 60 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist with common distinct strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) redox concentrations; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; slightly effervescent, calcium carbonate disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Platte County, Wyoming; 3 miles south of Glendo, about 2100 feet east and 2230 feet south of the northwest corner of Section 19, T. 29 N., R. 68 W. Sibley Peak Quadrangle.  42 degrees 28 minutes 18 seconds north latitude and 105 degrees 3 minutes 24 seconds west longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Anvil soils average 35 to 55 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  The soil is dry in the moisture control section for at least 60 consecutive days during the 90 day period following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5 YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam or gravelly sandy loam.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 20 percent.

The C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5  moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  The texture is coarse sandy loam, very gravelly coarse sand, very gravelly coarse sandy loam, extremely cobbly coarse sand, coarse sand, very gravely loamy sand, and fine sandy loam.  Rock fragments range from 10 to 70 percent, with the control section averaging more than 35 percent.  Reaction is moderately alkaline.  Redox concentrations commonly occur in the lower part of this horizon.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no competing series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Anvil soils are in ephemeral drainages and on terraces and floodplains.  They formed in high energy alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  Elevation is 4600 to 5600 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 15 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 48 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 110 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Clarkelen, Haverdad and Whitetail (T) soils.  These soils lack skeletal particle size control sections.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; low to medium runoff; moderately rapid or rapid permeability.  The depth to the seasonal high water table is 3 to 5 feet from May to October.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are utilized for grazing  domestic livestock and for wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is needleandthread, prairie sandreed, western wheatgrass, blue grama, needleleaf sedge, silver sagebrush, and cottonwood trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Anvil soils occur in eastern Wyoming.  The series is of limited extent.
