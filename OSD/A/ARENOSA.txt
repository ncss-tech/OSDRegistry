ARENOSA SERIES

The Arenosa series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in residuum weathered from Eocene age sandstone of the Claiborne Group. These gently to strongly sloping soils occur on summits and shoulders of interfluves of broad ridges on inland dissected coastal plain. Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Thermic, uncoated Ustic Quartzipsamments

TYPICAL PEDON: Arenosa fine sand, on an east-facing, convex, 1 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 152 m (499 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

   A--0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 in); pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; structureless single grain; loose; many fine roots and few medium roots and few coarse roots; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. (Thickness is 8 to 30 cm [3 to 12 in].)

   C1--13 to 51 cm (5 to 20 in); very pale brown (10YR 7/3) fine sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; structureless single grain; loose; common fine roots and few medium roots and few coarse roots; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.

   C2--51 to 109 cm (20 to 43 in); very pale brown (10YR 8/4) fine sand, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; structureless single grain; loose; few fine roots and few medium roots and few coarse roots; slightly acid; diffuse smooth boundary.

   C3--109 to 165 cm (43 to 65 in); very pale brown (10YR 8/3) fine sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; structureless single grain; loose; few fine roots and few medium roots; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.

   C4--165 to 203 cm (65 to 80 in); very pale brown (10YR 8/3) fine sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; structureless single grain; loose; few fine roots; few fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron; slightly acid. (Combined thickness of C horizons is 173 to 195 cm [68 to 77 in].)

TYPE LOCATION: Burleson County, Texas; from the intersection of Texas Highway 21 and Texas Highway 36 in Caldwell; 4.3 miles southwest on Texas Highway 21 to Farm to Market Road 908;, 3.4 miles northwest on Farm to Market Road 908, 160 ft north in rangeland. USGS topographic quad: Chriesman; Latitude: 30 degrees, 30 minutes, 45 seconds N; Longitude: 96 degrees, 47 minutes, 56 seconds W; UTM Easting: 711217 m, UTM Northing: 3377641 m, UTM Zone 14N. Datum: WGS84.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth of solum: more than 203 cm (80 in)
Soil moisture: Ustic soil moisture regime. The soil moisture control section is dry in some or all parts for 90 or more cumulative days in normal years, but it is not dry in all parts for more than half of the cumulative days when the soil temperature at a depth of 50 cm is higher than 5 degrees C.
Particle-size control section (weighted average):
Clay content: 0 to 3 percent
Silt content: 0 to 5 percent
Silt plus 2 times clay content: 1 to 5 percent
Sand content: 95 to 99 percent
Rock fragments: 0 to 5 percent quartzite gravels
Resistant minerals in the 0.02 to 2.0 mm fraction: 95 to 100 percent

A horizon
Hue: 10YR
Value:4 to 7
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: fine sand, sand
Redox concentrations: 0 to 5 percent, fine to medium, faint to distinct, masses of oxidized iron

Bw horizon, where present
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 6 to 8
Chroma: 6 to 8
Texture: fine sand, sand
Redox concentrations: 0 to 5 percent, fine to medium, faint to distinct, masses of oxidized iron

C horizon
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 6 to 8
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: fine sand, sand
Redox concentrations: 0 to 5 percent, fine to medium, faint to distinct, masses of oxidized iron
Rock fragments: 0 to 5 percent, fine to medium, quartzite gravels

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in the same family. Similar soils are the Eufaula, Padina, Patilo, Tivoli, and Tonkawa series.
Eufaula soils: have an argillic horizon consisting of lamellae.
Padina and Patilo soils: have an argillic horizon between a depth of 100 to 203 cm (40 to 80 in)
Tivoli soils: have less than 90 percent resistant minerals in the 0.02 to 2.0 mm fraction within the particle-size control section
Tonkawa soils: have an udic soil moisture regime and are coated

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: residuum weathered from Eocene age sandstone of the Claiborne Group
Landscape: inland dissected coastal plain
Landform: summits and shoulders of interfluves of broad ridges and side slopes of broad ridges
Slope: 1 to 12 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 762 to 1095 mm (30 to 43 in)
Precipitation pattern: Precipitation is mostly even throughout the year with the exception of May, June, and October being the wettest months of the year. July and August are the driest months.
Thornthwaite P-E index: 40 to 64
Mean annual air temperature: 18 to 21 degrees C (64 to 70 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 230 to 279 days
Elevation: 78 to 305 m (255 to 1000 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cadelake, Eufaula, Padina, Patilo and Silstid series.
Cadelake soils: have an umbric epipedon and occur on depressional toeslopes of ridges.
Eufaula soils: have an argillic horizon and occur on lower stream terrace positions.
Padina, Patilo, and Silstid soils: have an argillic horizon and occur on slightly lower similar positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained. Permeability is rapid. Runoff is negligible on 1 to 5 percent slopes and very low on 5 to 12 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: The major use is livestock grazing. A few areas are used to grow peanuts, watermelons, improved bermudagrass, and weeping lovegrass. The native plant community is an open savannah of sandjack oak, post oak, and blackjack oak trees. Yaupon shrubs are associated with the trees. The herbaceous component is tall and midgrasses dominated by little bluestem, yellow and slender indiangrass, and brownseed paspalum. A thin stand of purple lovegrass, red lovegrass, woolly sheath threeawn, Halls panicum, and thin paspalum occupy spaces between the tall grasses. Continuous overgrazing or over rest and the absence of fire tend to allow a vegetative shift towards woody species. Ecological site number: R087AY239TX (Very Deep Sand 28-40" PZ).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: East Central, Central, and North Central Texas; LRR J; MLRA 84B,84C,87A. The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Erath County, Texas; 1970. The name "Arenosa" comes from the Spanish translation of the word sandy.

REMARKS: These soils were formerly included with the Eufaula series. The Eufaula series has an argillic horizon.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle size control section: 25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in) [C1 and C2 horizons]

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 in) [A horizon]

Other features: less than 5 percent silt plus 2 times clay content in the particle size control section

Ustic soil moisture regime

Additional comments:
The Key to Classes of Coatings of Sands was revised with the adoption of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Seventh Edition, 1996. Previous editions defined the uncoated class as less than 5 percent silt plus clay in the particle size control section. The series concept has been revised which excludes some soils previously classified as uncoated which are now in the coated class.
