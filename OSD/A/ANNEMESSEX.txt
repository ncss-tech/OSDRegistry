REMARKS: Annemessex soils were previously mapped as Mattapex silt loam. Annemessex soils are differentiated from Mattapex by having a particle-size control section that is fine-loamy rather than fine-silty and having a seasonal water table between 25 and 51 cm (10 and 20 inches). 
Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 25 cm (Ap1 and Ap2 horizons).
Argillic horizon--the zone from 25 to 64 cm (Bt1, Bt2, 2Bt3, and 2BtG horizons).
Aquic conditions--the soil has redox depletions with color value of 4 or more and chroma of 2 or less, and redox concentrations within the upper 61 cm of the argillic horizon, with periodic saturation and reduction at some time during the year.
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 152 cm.
