ALTOGA SERIES

The Altoga series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous clayey alluvium derived from mudstone. These gently to strongly sloping soils are on risers on stream terraces. Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 864 mm (34 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, carbonatic, thermic Udic Haplustepts
