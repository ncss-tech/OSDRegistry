ALDER SERIES

The Alder series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from consolidated shale and sandstone.  These soils are on sedimentary plains, hills and escarpments.  Slopes are 2 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls
TYPICAL PEDON:  Alder clay loam, grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A1--0 to 3 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and plastic; many fine and very fine, common medium roots; less than 5 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.

    A2--3 to 9 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/1) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many fine and very fine, common medium roots; many fine and very fine, few medium pores; less than 5 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (A horizons are 6 to 14 inches thick.)

    Bt1--9 to 15 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to strong fine subangular blocky; very hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many fine and very fine, common medium roots; many fine and very fine, few medium pores; continuous faint clay films on faces of peds; less than 5 percent pebbles; few worm casts; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary.
 
    Bt2--15 to 21 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silty clay, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to strong fine subangular blocky; very hard, firm, sticky and very plastic; common fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; continuous faint clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent angular sandstone pebbles; few worm casts; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary.

    Bt3--21 to 26 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) clay loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common fine and very fine, few medium roots; many fine and very fine, few medium pores; continuous faint clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent angular sandstone pebbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear irregular boundary.  (Bt horizons are 7 to 20 inches thick.)

    Bk--26 to 31 inches; yellow (10YR 7/6) clay loam, brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine, few medium pores; 10 percent angular sandstone pebbles; common fine seams and masses of lime; strongly effervescent, moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).  (4 to 12 inches thick)
    
    Cr--31 to 60 inches; white (5Y 8/1) consolidated shale interbedded with sandstone.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Judith Basin Area, Montana, 1962.

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretations Records:  MT0358 and MT0770.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 9 inches (A1 and A2 horizons); an argillic horizon which is the particle-size control section from 9 to 26 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons); a horizon of secondary carbonate accumulation from 26 to 31 inches (Bk horizon).  Alder soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on udic.
