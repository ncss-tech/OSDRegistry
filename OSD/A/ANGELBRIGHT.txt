ANGELBRIGHT SERIES

The Angelbright series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in residuum from dolomite or dolomitic limestone. Angelbright soils are on summits and shoulders of hills and ridges on plateaus. Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 33 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, semiactive, nonacid, frigid Oxyaquic Udorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Angelbright very gravelly fine sandy loam - subalpine forest. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     A1--0 to 6 inches (0 to 15 cm); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate thick platy and weak fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky, slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots throughout; many very fine tubular pores; 5 percent cobbles, 35 percent gravel; noneffervescent; moderately acid (pH 5.8); abrupt smooth boundary

     A2--6 to 19 inches (15 to 48 cm); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4), very gravelly fine sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common very fine, and many medium and coarse roots throughout; many very fine tubular pores; 5 percent cobbles, 35 percent gravel; noneffervescent; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear smooth boundary

     E1--19 to 31 inches (48 to 79 cm); pink (7.5YR 7/4), very cobbly fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots throughout, many very fine tubular pores; 20 percent cobbles, and 30 percent gravel; noneffervescent; moderately acid (pH 5.8); abrupt smooth boundary

     E2--31 to 49 inches (79 to 124 cm); reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/6), very cobbly fine sandy loam, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; structureless massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine roots throughout; 40 percent cobbles, and 20 percent gravel, noneffervescent; moderately acid (pH 5.8); abrupt wavy boundary

     R--49 inches (124 cm); fractured dolomite bedrock

TYPE LOCATION: Coconino County, Arizona; located about 16.1 kilometers (10.0 miles) north of Bright Angel Point, Arizona; USGS Quadrangle Little Park Lake; Latitude 36.339170, Longitude -112.100000, Datum WGS84.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Typic udic moisture regime based on precipitation and Thornthwaite calculation.  Some moisture is retained in the soil profile throughout most years.
Mean annual soil temperature: 38 to 42 degrees F
Reaction: moderately acid to neutral
Depth to bedrock: 40 to 60 inches
Clay content: 8 to 18 percent
Rock fragments: more than 35 percent

A horizons:
Hue: 10YR, 7.5YR
Value: 3 to 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist
Texture: fine sandy loam, loam

E horizons:
Hue: 10YR, 7.5YR
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist
Texture: fine sandy loam, loam
Some pedons have Cr or Bw horizons.
Some pedons may have iron concentrations and redoximorphic features in the lower part.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: Limestone and dolomite
Landform: summits and sideslopes hills and ridges on plateaus
Slopes: 2 to 40 percent
Elevation: 8700 to 9200 feet
Mean annual temperature: 36 to 41 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 30 to 35 inches
Precipitation pattern: Wettest months: December through March
Driest months: May, June
Frost-free period: 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hikai and Veetee soils. Hikai soils are nonskeletal and have an argillic horizon. Veetee soils also have an argillic horizon and are nonskeletal but in addition have an Aquic moisture regime.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: moderately well drained, low to high runoff, moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for recreation, pasture and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation includes Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, white fir, Douglas fir, and quaking aspen.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Kaibab Plateau above 8700 feet in north central Arizona; MLRA 35. The series is of moderate extent.
