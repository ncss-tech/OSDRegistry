ASHBUTTE SERIES


The Ashbutte series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in tephra from cinder cone volcanoes. Ashbutte soils are on cinder cone volcanoes in the Southern Cascade mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 51 inches (1295 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F (5 degrees C).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy over medial-skeletal, amorphic, frigid Typic Vitrixerands

When described on 8/16/06, the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ashbutte soils are on cinder cones in the Southern Cascade mountains. Slopes are 15 to 70 percent. These soils formed in tephra. Elevation is 6526 to 7600 feet (1989 to 2316 m). Mean annual precipitation is 27 to 57 inches (686 to 1448 mm). The mean annual temperature is 41 to 42 degrees F (5 to 6 degrees C). Frost free season is 50 to 85 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Scoured and Buttelake soils. The Scoured soils are moderately deep to lithic bedrock and occur on glaciated headlands. The Buttelake soils are deep to dense glacial till and occur on moraines.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; very rapid saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for wildlife habitat, recreation, ecosystem management and watershed. Vegetation is California red fir, Jeffrey pine, white fir, bush chinquapin, snowbrush ceanothus, greenleaf manzanita and buckwheat.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The soils are inextensive and are mapped in MLRA: 22B, Southern Cascade Mountains
