ADY SERIES

The Ady series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils derived from loamy sediments from the upper part of the Ogallala Formation of Miocene-Pliocene age.  Ady soils are nearly level to gently sloping interfluves, erosion remnants, and hillslopes.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is 15 degrees C (59 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 496 mm (19 in).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used as rangeland, but significant acreage is cropped.  Principal crops grown are wheat and grain sorghum.  Climax vegetation is mainly short and mid grasses, with mid grasses tending to dominate, and a smaller tall grass component.  This site is dominated by blue grama with lesser amounts of sideoats grama, buffalograss, Arizona cottontop, little bluestem, gaura, plains zinnia, prairieclover, bundleflower, wild alfalfa, and ephedra.  Woody plants include catclaw sensitivebrier, yucca, and sand sagebrush.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  LRR-H; Southern High Plains, Breaks (MLRA 77E) of the Texas panhandle, and western Oklahoma.  This soil is extensive.
