ANNALAKE SERIES 

The Annalake series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy, stratified glaciofluvial deposits.  These soils are on glacial lake plains, outwash plains, moraines, deltas, lake terraces, and outwash terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 810 millimeters.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 79 to 99 centimeters; series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 15 centimeters (A and E horizons); 
albic horizon--the zone from a depth of 8 to 15 centimeters (E horizon); 
spodic horizon--the zone from a depth of 15 to 43 centimeters (Bs1 and Bs2 horizons); 
glossic horizon--the zone from a depth of 43 to 79 centimeters (E/B horizon); 
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 79 to 99 centimeters (Bt horizon);
udic moisture regime.

Oxyaquic subgroup based on redoximorphic accumulations and saturation below the spodic horizon but within 1.0 meter for 20 or more consecutive days or 30 or more cumulative days during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of 30 year mean of annual precipitation

This soil was formerly mapped as the moderately well drained phase of the Alcona series.

Cation-exchange activity class is based on laboratory data from similar soils.
