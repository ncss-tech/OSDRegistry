ADDICKS SERIES

The Addicks series consists of deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in thick loamy sediments. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on flats on coastal plains. Mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (69 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 1169 mm (46 in). Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Harris County, Texas; 1973.

REMARKS:  These soils were formerly included in the Clodine and Morey series. Classification was changed from argiaquolls to argiudolls based on new taxonomic criteria and is no longer classified as a hydric soil.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle size control section: 28 to 79 cm (11 to 31 in). (Bt and Btk1 horizon) 

Mollic epipedon -0 to 28 cm (0 to 11 in). (A horizon)

Argillic horizon - 28 to 203 cm (11 to 80 in). (Bt and Btk horizons)

Calcic horizon - 58 to 125 cm (23 to 49 in). (Btk horizons)

ADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL Data on type - S72TX101-5 (72L273-72L276) and thin sections on file in the Soil Survey Laboratory support an argillic horizon.  Data from nearby similar landscape published in TAMU thesis: Distribution and Genesis of Calcic Horizons in some soils of the Texas Coast Prairies by Terrence M. Sobecki does not support an argillic horizon.
