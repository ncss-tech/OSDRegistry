MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Appling and Jeff Davis Counties, Georgia; 1969.

REMARKS: Albany soils have sandy layers that extend to a depth of more than 100 centimeters (about 40 inches). They were originally classified as Grossarenic Paleudults; however, they are presently classified as Aquic Arenic by the order in which they occur in the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 10th Edition.  Plans are underway to revise the Key and a re-classification to a subgroup that recognizes the Grossarenic feature is anticipated.

Data collected in Effingham County, GA indicate depth to redoximorphic features thought to indicate dominant seasonal wetness range from about 53 to 74 centimeters with an average depth of 63 centimeters. However, during the wettest periods of the non-growing season (typically January), Albany soils may be saturated for short periods (less than 20 consecutive or 30 cumulative days in a normal year) at a depth of 30 to 50 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to about 123 centimeters; about 48 inches (Ap, E1, E2, E3 horizons).
Grossarenic feature--a zone with sandy particle-size class extending from 0 to about 122 centimeters; about 48 inches (Ap and E horizons).
Argillic horizon--the zone from approximately 122 to 224 centimeters; about 48 to 88 inches (Bt and Btg horizons).
Aquic conditions--periodic saturation and reduction in a zone from about 64 to 203 centimeters; about 25 to 80 inches at some time during the year (endosaturation).
Redox concentrations--the zone from 18 to 203 centimeters; about 7 to 80 inches (E, Bt, and Btg horizons)
Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less--the zone from 64 to 203 centimeters; about 25 to 88 inches (E2, E3, Bt, and Btg horizons)
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 200 centimeters; about 80 inches
