ANNIEVILLE SERIES

The Annieville series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in 100 to 150 centimeters of loess over till.  These soils are on interfluves and side slopes on dissected till plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 9 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 725 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Rock County, Minnesota, March, 2002. 

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 50 centimeters (Ap, A, AB horizons);
cambic horizon--zone from a depth of 50 to 132 centimeters (Bw1, Bw2, Bw3);
udic moisture regime.

This soil was formerly part of the Galva series.

Further investigation is needed to determine the structural class of the lower C or BC horizons.  This till typically exhibits fractures and structural planes to depths of 2 meters or more.

Cation-exchange activity class is supported by lab data from the KSSL.
