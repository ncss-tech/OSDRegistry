APPLERIVER SERIES

The Appleriver series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in 75 to 127 centimeters (30 to 50 inches) of loess and in residuum from calcareous shale. These soils are on treads and risers of structural benches and rounded ridges on uplands. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (48 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 86 centimeters (34 inches).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquic Hapludalfs

TYPE LOCATION: Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) 105; Jo Daviess County, Illinois; about 348 meters (1,140 feet) east and 750 meters (2,460 feet) north of the southwest corner of section 27, T. 29 N., R. 4 E.; USGS Elizabeth NE quadrangle; lat. 42 degrees 28 minutes 49 seconds N. and long. 90 degrees 2 minutes 32 seconds W., NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to bedrock ranges from 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches). The thickness of the loess ranges from 75 to 127 centimeters (30 to 50 inches). Content of clay in the particle-size control section (weighted average) is 28 to 35 percent. Content of sand in the particle-size control section (weighted average) is less than 10 percent

The Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam. Clay content ranges from 22 to 27 percent. Sand content is less than 10 percent. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.

The E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4. Clay content ranges from 22 to 27 percent. Sand content is less than 10 percent. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.

The BE horizon has characteristics similar to the E horizon and the Bt horizon.

The Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Average clay content ranges from 28 to 35 percent. Sand content is less than 10 percent. Individual subhorizons have clay content as low as 22 percent or as high as 37 percent. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately acid.

The 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. Average clay content ranges from 37 to 45 percent. Average sand content ranges from 5 to 20 percent. Individual subhorizons have clay content as high as 50 percent. Rock fragment content ranges from 1 to 15 percent. Rock fragments are dominantly gravel size chert and shale. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline.

The 2Cr horizon has colors similar to those defined for the 2Bt horizon.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Blair, Bunkum, Fishhook, Freeburg, Geff, Glenford, Muren, Reesville, Sugarvalley, Torox, and Xenia series. These soils do not have a lithic or paralithic contact within a depth of 150 centimeters (60 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Appleriver soils formed in 75 to 127 centimeters (30 to 50 inches) of loess and in residuum from calcareous shale. Appleriver soils are on treads and risers of structural benches and rounded ridges on uplands. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 81 to 91 centimeters (32 to 36 inches).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Derinda, Eleroy, Fayette, Massbach, and Rozetta soils. These soils are better drained than the Appleriver soils and are generally in more sloping or more dissected landforms. Also, the Massbach soils have a darker surface layer.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained--a saturated zone occurs within depths of 0.45 to 0.9 meters (1.5 to 3 feet) during the wettest portions of normal years and is considered perched. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the loess and low in the residuum. The potential for surface runoff is negligible or low.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. The principle crops are corn, soybeans, small grain, and meadow. Native vegetation is hardwood deciduous trees.
