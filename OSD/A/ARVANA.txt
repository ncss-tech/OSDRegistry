ARVANA SERIES

The Arvana series consists of soils that are moderately deep to a petrocalcic horizon. They are well drained, moderately permeable soils derived from loamy eolian deposits from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. Arvana soils are on nearly level to gently sloping plains and playa slopes. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 483 mm (19 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (60 degrees F).

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Moderate permeability. Runoff is negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes, very low on 1 to 3 percent slopes, and low on 3 to 5 percent slopes. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used for crop production but also used as native rangeland and wildlife habitat. Principal crops grown are cotton, grain sorghum, and wheat. Climax vegetation is mainly short and mid grasses, with mid grasses tending to dominate, with a smaller tall grass compliment. This site is dominated by blue grama with lesser amounts of sideoats grama, buffalograss, little bluestem, gauras, plains zinnia, prairieclover, bundleflower, and wild alfalfa, and ephedra. Woody plants include catclaw sensitivebrier, yucca, and sand sagebrush. Dominant vegetation on the loamy fine sands is sideoats grama, bluestems, and switchgrass, while on the fine sandy loams is sideoats grama, blue grama, buffalograss, and Arizona cottontop. This soil has been correlated to the Sandy Loam (R077CY036TX) and Sandy (R077CY035TX) ecological site in MLRA-77C. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern High Plains, Southern Part (MLRA 77C in LRR H) of Texas and New Mexico. The series is extensive.

REMARKS: This is a Benchmark Series. 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in). (Ap horizon) 
Argillic horizon: 20 to 71 cm (8 to 28 in). (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons) 
Petrocalcic horizon: 71 to 97 cm (28 to 38 in). (indurated to strongly cemented Bkkm horizon) 
Calcic horizon: 97 to 203 cm (38 to 80 in). (BCkk, 2Btk horizons) 
Carbonate plugged horizon (kk): 71 to 152 cm (28 to 60 in) (Bkkm, BCkk) 
Note: the kk feature is defined as pedogenic carbonate accumulation that is characterized by laterally continuous carbonates that have engulfed rock, sand, silt, and clay particles, plugged the macroporosity of the soil horizon with 50 percent or more calcium carbonate, and obliterated the original soil structure.
