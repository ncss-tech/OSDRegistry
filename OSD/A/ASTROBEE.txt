ASTROBEE SERIES

The Astrobee series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in sandy gypsiferous eolian deposits. These nearly level soils are on interdunes, low dunes, and relict shorelines in dune fields. Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bracken (NV), Mamtrack (NM), Peligro (NM), Shot (NM), Whitebasin (NV), Wulie (NM), and Yesum (NM) series. Bracken soils have less than 30 percent selenite crystals in the PSCS, are deep to a paralithic contact and are in the Mohave Desert (MLRA 30). Mamtrack soils have gleyed hues within the PSCS and are found on relict shorelines. Peligro soils are formed in strongly sloping relict playa dunes. Shot soils have hues of 5YR and 7.5YR and have less than 60 percent gypsum in the PSCS. Whitebasin soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact and are in the Mohave Desert (MLRA 30). Wulie soils have less than 35 percent selenite crystals in the PSCS and have a lacustrine horizon at the bottom of the PSCS. Yesum soils have sandy loam and finer textures and are moderately to strongly saline.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Astrobee soils are on interdunes, low dunes, and relict shorelines in dune fields. Slope is 0 to 10 percent. These soils formed from sandy gypsiferous eolian deposits. Elevation ranges from 3,880 to 4,140 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. Precipitation falls in all months as gentle winter storms and with increased amounts during high intensity summer storms. The mean annual air temperature is 62 to 70 degrees F. The frost-free period is 180 to 250 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Transformer, and Lark series. Transformer soils are on interdunes and have oxyaquic conditions. Lark soils are on semi-active dunes and do not have a gypsic horizon.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Excessively drained; very low to negligible runoff; very rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: The major uses are military exercises and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is gyp dropseed, rough coldenia, Torrey's Ephedra, and gypsum grama. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South central New Mexico, limited to the gypsum dune fields of the Tularosa Basin, MLRA 42. Astrobee is of limited extent.
