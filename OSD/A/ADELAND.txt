ADELAND SERIES

The Adeland series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of loess or other silty material and in the underlying glacial drift over residuum weathered from interbedded acid siltstone and shale. The Adeland soils are on landforms influenced by Wisconsinan glaciation. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Aeric Endoaqualfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Adeland silt loam, on a 1 percent slope in a cultivated field at an elevation of about 194 meters (635 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist conditions unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; friable; strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [15 to 28 cm (6 to 11 inches) thick]

 E--18 to 25 cm (7 to 10 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; moderate medium platy structure parting to moderate medium granular; friable; common fine and very fine roots; common fine distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) masses of iron accumulation in the matrix; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. [0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 inches) thick]

 Bt1--25 to 33 cm (10 to 13 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) silty clay; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very firm; common very fine roots; common distinct dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay films on faces of peds; common fine prominent grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions in the matrix; 1 percent rock fragments; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. [0 to 36 cm (0 to 14 inches) thick]

 2Bt2--33 to 53 cm (13 to 21 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) clay; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very firm; common very fine roots; common distinct dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay films on faces of peds; many fine prominent grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions in the matrix; 8 percent rock fragments; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.

 2Bt3--53 to 74 cm (21 to 29 inches); light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very firm; few distinct dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay films on faces of peds; many fine distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions in the matrix; 2 percent rock fragments; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the 2Bt horizon is 36 to 86 cm (14 to 34 inches).]

 3C--74 to 86 cm (29 to 34 inches); light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silty clay; massive; firm; common fine prominent olive yellow (2.5Y 6/8) masses of iron accumulation in the matrix; many fine distinct gray (N 6/) iron depletions in the matrix; 12 percent shale fragments; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary. [0 to 51 cm (0 to 20 inches) thick]

 3R--86 cm (34 inches); dark gray (10YR 4/1) unweathered, thinly bedded siltstone and shale; strongly acid.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Lamine and Savona series. Lamine and Savona soils do not have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Adeland soils are on landforms influenced by Wisconsinan glaciation. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. The soils formed in as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of loess or other silty material and in the underlying glacial drift over residuum. In places the residuum is from stratified siltstone and shale, but in other areas the residuum is from a single component. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1067 mm (36 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 12 degrees C (50 to 54 degrees F). Frost-free period ranges from 150 to 180 days. Elevation ranges from 183 to 244 meters (600 to 800 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Loudonville, Mahalasville, bedrock substratum; Miami, Rainsville, Rockfield, Russell, and Silverwood soils. The well drained Loudonville soils are on higher lying rises on bedrock terraces. The poorly drained Mahalasville, bedrock substratum soils are in depressions. The very deep, moderately well drained Miami, Rainsville, and Rockfield soils, and the well drained Russell soils are on till plains. The well drained Silverwood soils are on lower lying stream terraces underlain with sand and gravel.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. The potential for surface runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the loess or silty material; moderately high in the drift; and moderately low or moderately high in the underlying residuum. Permeability is moderate in the loess or silty material, moderately slow in the glacial drift, and slow or moderately slow in the underlying residuum.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of these soils are used to grow corn, soybeans, wheat, and meadow. Some areas are in pasture or woodlots. Native vegetation is hardwood forests of beech, sugar maple, oak, white ash, American elm, and hickory.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West-central Indiana; MLRA 111D. The series is of small extent.
