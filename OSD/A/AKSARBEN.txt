These soils were previously mapped as Sharpsburg soils. The Sharpsburg soils are moderately well drained and have a perched water table at a depth of 1.2 to 1.8 meters (4 to 6 feet).

CL 6/30/2008 Removed the term mottling from the OSD and replaced with redox or redoximorphic features. All SE units were removed.

Updated thickness of the mollic horizon.
Added sand content for each horizon in the RIC using lab data.
Updated competing series for Mulholland and Sharpsburg.
Updated geographic setting (elevation, precipitation, and frost free days).
Updated geographically associated soils to meet MO5 standards (deleted Butler, Geary, and Mayberry series and added Fillmore and Gymer).
