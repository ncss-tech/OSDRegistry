ACKELTON SERIES

The Ackelton series consists of deep to a duripan, well drained soils on basalt plains and buttes that formed in eolian deposits reworked by water.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Average annual temperature is 49 degrees F., and average annual precipitation is about 10 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  Dixie, Paulville, Sevy and Woozle series.  These soils lack a duripan below 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ackelton soils are on basalt plains and buttes.  They formed in eolian material reworked by water.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevations are 3,200 to 4,200 feet.  The average annual temperature is 48 to 51 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 9 to 11 inches. Frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Ackelton soils occur in concave positions in complex with Wako and Wendell soils.  Wendell soils are on convex positions, have a weak argillic horizon and are moderately deep to a thin duripan and bedrock. Wako soils are in concave positions on sideslopes, have a well-developed argillic horizon and are moderately deep to a thick duripan.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Cropland and Rangeland.  Some areas are cropped or used for homesite development. The potential native vegetation is principally Thurber needlegrass, Indian ricegrass and basin big sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southcentral Idaho.  Ackelton soils are of small extent.
