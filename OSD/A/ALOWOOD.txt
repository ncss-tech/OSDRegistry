ALOWOOD SERIES

The Alowood series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy colluvium from the Ogallala Formation of Miocene-Pliocene age over mudstone, sandstone, siltstone, or shale residuum of Permian age.  These soils are on very gently sloping to moderately steep hills and hillslopes in the Southern High Plains, Breaks (MLRA-77E).  The slope is predominately 1 to 8 percent, but ranges from 1 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm (21 in), and mean annual temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).

Deepwood, Quinlan, and Woodward soils occur on lower landscapes and were formed in residuum from Permian shale, siltstone, and sandstone.  
Woodward, Quinlan, and Deepwood soils: do not have a covering mantle of Ogallala colluvial sediments, and do not have a calcic horizon 

Dreyfoos soils: occur on higher landscapes in eolian sands, have textures coarser than loamy fine sand throughout, and do not have coarse fragments

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage class: well drained
Permeability: moderate 
Runoff: low on 1 to 5 percent slopes, and medium on 5 to 20 percent slopes

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern High Plains, Breaks (MLRA 77E in LRR H) of the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles, and counties in northwestern Oklahoma and southwestern Kansas. Distribution is bounded to the south by the Salt Fork of the Red River and to the north by the Cimarron River.  This soil is moderately extensive.
