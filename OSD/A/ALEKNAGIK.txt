ALEKNAGIK SERIES

The Aleknagik series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash over glacial drift on rises and of plains and on hills. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 775 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 0.5 degrees C.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Nushagak-Mulchatna Watershed Soil Survey, Dillingham Census Area, Alaska, 2015

REMARKS: 
Particle-size control section - 34 to 109 cm 
Ochric epipedon 
Soil moisture regime - Udic 
Andic soil properties - Bhs and BC1 (or BC) horizons 
Spodic Horizon - Bhs horizon 
Albic Horizon - E/A horizon

Type location was moved during initial mapping of Nushagak-Mulchatna Watershed Soil Survey, classification updated to reflect documentation. The series was proposed in the 1964 Dillingham Area, Alaska, Soil Survey. Established during the final correlation of the Togiak, AK Soil Survey where it is also used. The tentative series Snagpoint was correlated to Aleknagik, which had previously not been established. Previous classification was coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Spodic Dystrocryepts.
