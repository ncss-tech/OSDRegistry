AEROBEE SERIES

The Aerobee series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian modified gypsiferous fine-loamy alluvium. These nearly level soils are on interdunes, basin floors, and alluvial flats.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Aerobee soils are on interdunes, basin floors, and alluvial flats. Slope is 0 to 5 percent. These soils formed in eolian modified gypsiferous fine-loamy alluvium. Elevation ranges from 3,950 to 4,490 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. Precipitation falls in all months as gentle winter storms and with increased amounts during high intensity summer storms. The mean annual air temperature is 62 to 70 degrees F. The frost-free period is 180 to 250 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Shrike (T) (NM), Shot, and Hembrillo series. Shrike soils are on interdunes and contain a fine-loamy lacustrine layer beneath the sandy particle-size control section. Shot soils are on dunes and have a sandy particle-size control section. Hembrillo soils are on dunes and do not have pedogenic gypsum masses. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: well drained; low runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: The major uses are military exercises and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is alkali sacaton, four wing saltbush, Torrey's ephedra, Berlandier's wolfberry. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South central New Mexico, limited to the Tularosa Basin. MLRA 42, Aerobee is of limited extent.
