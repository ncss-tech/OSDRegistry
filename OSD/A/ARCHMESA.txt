ARCHMESA SERIES

The Archmesa series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived from andesite. Archmesa soils are on mesas. Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 475 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Archmesa loam, on a southeast facing 10 percent slope in ponderosa pine woodland at an elevation of 2,590 meters. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) When described on October 6, 1999, the soil was moist from 0 to 90 cm.

    A1--0 to 8 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. 

    A2--8 to 25 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky parting to moderate medium granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; few fine tubular pores; 2 percent angular gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of A1, A2 - 18 to 40 cm)

    Bt1--25 to 53 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common distinct clay films on ped faces; many fine and few medium roots; few fine tubular pores; 5 percent angular gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. 

    Bt2--53 to 89 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few distinct clay films on ped faces; few fine and few medium roots; few fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel and 5 percent flagstones; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (combined thickness of Bt1, Bt2 - 20 to 60 cm)

    R--89 cm; hard andesite bedrock, weathered in the top 5 cm.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Jicarilla Apache Area, New Mexico, 2000. The series was proposed in the Archuleta County Area, Colorado.  The name is coined from Archuleta Mesa where the type description is located.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 25 cm (A1, A2 horizons)
Argillic horizon: 25 to 89 cm (Bt1, Bt2 horizons)
Lithic contact: 89 cm to andesite bedrock (R layer)
Particle-size control section: from 25 to 75 cm. (Bt1 and upper part of Bt2 horizons)

Archmesa soils are in a frigid temperature regime and have an ustic soil moisture class with a typic subclass.

Remarks: The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
