ACANTILADO SERIES

The Acantilado series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from red sandstone and shale.  Acantilado soils are on fans remnants and plains.  Slope ranges from 1 to 9 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches (38 cm) and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F (11 degrees C).

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Las Animas County, Colorado, 2007. The name means cliff in Spanish.

REMARKS: This series was formerly included in the Alicia series.  Alicia soils have a soil moisture control section that is dry for longer periods of time and do not have argillic horizons.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section: 0 to 62 inches (0 to 158 cm).
Particle-size control section: 15 to 35 inches (38 to 88 cm).  (Btk1 and part of the Btk2 horizons)

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 4 inches (0 to 10 cm).  (A horizon)
Cambic horizon: 4 to 15 inches (10 to 38 cm).  (Bw horizons)
Argillic horizon: 15 to 62 inches (38 to158 cm).  (Btk1, Btk2, Btk3 and Btk4 horizons)
Calcic horizon: 15 to 62 inches (38 to158 cm).  (Btk1, Btk2, Btk3 and Btk4 horizons)

Remarks: 2/2004 WAW Added clay loam texture for Btk, corrected spelling of Kucu competing series.

10/2007 WAW Added metric units, edited parent materials and landform terminology.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
