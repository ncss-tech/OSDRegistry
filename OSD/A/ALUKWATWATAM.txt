REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features in this pedon
*Umbric epipedon--zone from 5 to 41 cm
*Cambic horizon--zone from 41 to 124 cm
*Andic soil properties--zone from 5 to 163 cm
*Particle-size control section--zone from 5 to 107 cm; ashy in zone from 5 to 58 cm; cindery in zone from 58 to 107 cm

Values for andic soil properties, including glass content, acid oxalate aluminum and iron, and 15-bar water retention, were estimated based on laboratory data for similar soils.

The Alukwatwatam series originally was named the Poletad series. Alukw'at watam translates to frog lake in the Yakama language. The type location for the series is about 800 m east of Tadpole Lake, on the Yakama Reservation.
