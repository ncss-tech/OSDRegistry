ARLEN SERIES

The Arlen series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum from welded tuff or rhyolite. These soils are on mountains and hills.  Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-skeletal, glassy, calcareous, frigid Lithic Ustorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Arlen very gravelly sandy loam, in woodland  (colors are for dry colors unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 3 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) very gravelly ashy sandy loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak coarse granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; 30 percent pebbles, 10 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (1 to 5 inches thick)

    BCk--3 to 9 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) very gravelly ashy sandy loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and common fine roots; 40 percent pebbles, 10 percent cobbles; common fine threads and masses of lime; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 12 inches thick)

    Cr--9 to 13 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) decomposing welded tuff bedrock. (3 to 6 inches thick)

    R--13 inches; light gray (5Y 7/1), fractured, hard, welded tuff bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - hills; mountains.
Elevation - 5,200 to 6,200 feet.
Slope - 8 to 60  percent.
Parent material - residuum from welded tuff or rhylite bedrock.
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers.
Mean annual precipitation - 15 to 24 inches.
Mean annual air temperature - 36 to 40 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 70 to 90 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Arlen soils are mainly used for woodland, understory grazing, watershed, and as wildlife habitat.  The potential native vegetation is mainly scattered  Douglas-fir, Rocky Mountain juniper, limber pine, bitterbrush, common juniper, Oregongrape, bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, sandberg bluegrass and rose.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Arlen soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Deer Lodge County, Montana, 1999.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretive record: MT1741.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: an ochric epipedon from the surface to 9 inches (A and BCk horizons); a horizon of secondary carbonate accumulation from 3 to 9 inches (BCk horizon); a particle size control section from the surface to 9 inches (A and BCk horizons); a layer of decomposing welded tuff from 9 to 13 inches (Cr horizon); welded tuff bedrock at 13 inches (R horizon).  Arlen soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
