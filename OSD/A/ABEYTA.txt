ABEYTA SERIES

The Abeyta series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Abeyta soils are on hillslopes and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 30 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 508 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Abeyta loam, on a northwest facing, simple, 36 percent slope in coniferous woodland at an elevation of 2,256 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on December 22, 2005 the soil was moist from 0 to 38 cm and dry below.

    Oi--0 to 5 cm; slightly decomposed plant material, neutral. (0 to 8 cm thick)

    A1--5 to 15 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; very friable, soft, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few very fine roots throughout; violently effervescent; 18 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.

    A2--15 to 38 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; friable, slightly hard, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few very fine roots throughout; few very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; 26 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of A1, A2 - 20 to 40 cm)

    Bk--38 to 74 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to strong fine subangular blocky; firm, hard, very sticky, very plastic; few very fine roots throughout; few very fine tubular pores; 5 percent parachanners; violently effervescent; 30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; finely disseminated carbonates and fine threadlike carbonate masses; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 61 cm thick)

    Cr--74 to 99 cm; weakly cemented calcareous shale bedrock, moderately alkaline.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, rapid runoff, slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Major use is timber production, livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and home site development.  Native vegetation consists of Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, Gambel oak, snowberry, Arizona fescue, and Junegrass.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES PROPOSED:  Archuleta County, Archuleta County Area soil survey area, Colorado, 2008.  The name is taken from Abeyta Mesa in the survey area.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - 5 to 38 cm (A1 and A2 horizons)
Calcic horizon - 38 to 74 cm (Bk horizon)
Paralithic contact - 74 cm to shale bedrock (Cr horizon)
Particle size control section - 25 to 74 cm (part of the 
A2 and the Bk horizon)

Abeyta soils have a frigid temperature regime and are in an ustic soil moisture regime bordering on udic.
