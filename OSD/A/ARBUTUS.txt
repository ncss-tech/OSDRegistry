ARBUTUS SERIES

The Arbutus series consists of moderately deep, excessively drained soils which formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of siliceous sandy alluvium overlying igneous or metamorphic bedrock.  These soils are on strath terraces.  Slope ranges from 2 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, siliceous, frigid Entic Haplorthods

TYPICAL PEDON:  Arbutus loamy sand, from an area of Ironrun-Ponycreek-Arbutus complex, on a convex, north-facing slope of 2 percent, in a mixed hardwood and conifer forest, at an elevation of 274 meters above sea level.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   A--0 to 5 centimeters; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loamy sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many fine to coarse roots; extremely acid; abrupt smooth boundary.

   E--5 to 13 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 4/2) loamy sand, brown (7.5YR 5/2) dry; weak medium platy structure; very friable; many fine to coarse roots; extremely acid; abrupt wavy boundary.

   Bs1--13 to 25 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 4/4) loamy sand; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; common fine and medium roots; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.

   Bs2--25 to 43 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 5/4) loamy sand; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; few fine and medium roots; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary 

   Bw--43 to 64 centimeters; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) sand; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; very friable; few fine roots; moderately acid; abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 64 centimeters thick)

   2R--64 centimeters; slightly fractured igneous bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Rockdam series.
Rockdam--do not have a lithic contact within the series control section

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--50 to 100 centimeters of siliceous sandy alluvium overlying igneous or metamorphic bedrock
Landform--strath terraces
Slope--2 to 6 percent
Elevation--205 to 470 meters above sea level
Mean annual air temperature--4 to 8 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation--685 to 840 millimeters
Frost-free period--135 to 180 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ironrun, Ponycreek, Rockdam, and Tarr soils.
Ironrun--are on lower landscape positions and have a frequently saturated zone between depths of 0.3 to 0.6 meter during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Ponycreek--are on lower landscape positions in depressions and have are frequently saturated from the surface of the soil to a depth of 0.3 meter during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Rockdam--are on slightly lower landscape positions and have a frequently saturated zone between depths of 1.0 to 1.8 meters during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Tarr--are on landscape positions similar to those of the Arbutus soils and do not have a lithic contact within the series control section

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--excessively drained-- a frequently saturated zone does not occur within a depth of 1.8 meters during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of 30 year mean of annual precipitation
