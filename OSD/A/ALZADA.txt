ALZADA SERIES

The Alzada series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Torrertic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Alzada clay loam, in grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 2 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sandy clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 4 inches thick)

   Bw--2 to 10 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine roots; few very fine and fine pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds and in pores; disseminated lime; sightly effervescent; mildly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual smooth boundary.  (6 to 15 inches thick)

    Bk--10 to 16 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and very plastic; common very fine roots; few fine masses of lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary.  (4 to 7 inches thick)

    2Bkyz--16 to 36 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) silty clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak medium prismatic structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many fine and medium masses and seams of gypsum crystals; few fine seams of other salts; few fine seams of lime; strongly effervescent; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (12 to 24 inches thick)

    2C--36 to 60 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) clay, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; massive; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; neutral (pH 7.2)

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Carter County, Montana, 1992. The name is for a town in Carter County, MT.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations records:  MT0546 and MT0216.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches (A and Bw horizons); a cambic horizon from 2 to 16 inches (Bw, Bk horizons; a lithologic discontinuity at 16 inches (2Bkyz horizon).  Alzada soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.

Classification changed from Borollic Camborthids to Aridic Ustochrepts in 1994.
