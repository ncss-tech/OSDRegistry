ALMERIA SERIES

The Almeria series consists of very deep poorly drained and very poorly drained soils that formed in stratified sandy alluvium on valley flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C. (49 degrees F.), and the mean annual precipitation is about 51 centimeters (20 inches). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Typic Fluvaquents 

TYPICAL PEDON: Almeria loamy fine sand with a slope of 1 percent in rangeland. (Colors are for moist soil unless stated otherwise.) 

  A--0 to 13 centimeters (0 to 5 inches); very dark gray (10YR 3/1) loamy fine sand, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; few thin strata of fine sand and fine sandy loam; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; common fine and very fine roots throughout; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (5 to 23 centimeters (2 to 9 inches) thick) 

  Cg1--13 to 33 centimeters (5 to 13 inches); stratified dark gray (10YR 4/1) and brown (10YR 4/3) fine sand, gray (10YR 5/1) and brown (10YR 5/3) dry; few thin strata of loamy fine sand and fine sandy loam; common fine and medium distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4) iron masses along root channels and in the matrix; single grain; loose; common fine and very fine roots throughout; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. 

  Cg2--33 to 66 centimeters (13 to 26 inches); stratified dark gray (10YR 4/1) and brown (10YR 5/3) fine sand, gray (10YR 5/1) and pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; few thin strata of loamy fine sand and fine sandy loam; common fine and medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist, iron masses along root channels and in the matrix; single grain; loose; few fine and very fine roots throughout; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. 

  2Ab--66 to 91 centimeters (26 to 36 inches); black (10YR 2/1) fine sandy loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; massive; soft, very friable; few fine and very fine roots throughout; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. 

  2Cg--91 to 203 centimeters (36 to 80 inches); dark gray (10YR 4/1) fine sand, gray (10YR 6/1) dry; single grain; loose; few fine and very fine roots throughout; neutral. 

TYPE LOCATION: Cherry County, Nebraska; about 29 kilometers (18 miles) north and 16 kilometers (10 miles) east of Mullen, 457 meters (1500 feet) south and 442 meters (1450 feet west of the northeast corner of section 17, T.27 N., R. 30 Lowes Lake, Nebraska topographic quadrangle; lat. 42 degrees, 19 minutes, 01 seconds N, long. 100 degrees, 50 minutes and 3 seconds W. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth to free carbonates: can occur below 102 centimeters (40 inches)
Depth to redoximorphic features: 0 to 41 centimeters (0 to 16 inches)
Endosaturation depth: 0 to 46 centimeters (0 to 18 inches)
Texture: Strata of loamy very fine sand or finer between 25 and 102 centimeters (10 and 40 inches) 
Particle-size control section (weighted average): Clay content: 1 to 10 percent 
Rock fragments: less than 2 to 10 percent by volume 

A horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 3 to 6, 2 to 5 moist
Chroma: 1 to 3
Texture: loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sand, very fine sandy loam, loam, mucky loam, mucky fine sandy loam, or mucky peat 
Reaction: slightly acid to moderately alkaline
Comments: The A horizon is too thin or light-colored to classify in a mollic subgroup. Thin strata of light and dark colored, finer and coarser textured material are common in the A horizon. Some pedons have an AC horizon from 3 to 13 centimeters (1 to 5 inches) thick. Some pedons have a thin layer of slightly decomposed plant material on the surface. 

Cg & 2Cg horizons:
Hue:10YR to 5Y
Value: 3 to 8, 2 to 7 moist
Chroma: 1 to 3
Texture: sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand with thin strata [1 to 25 centimeters (1/8 inch to 10 inches)] of finer or coarser textured layers including mucky mineral and organic layers
Reaction: moderately acid to neutral; slightly alkaline strata are included 

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Pelic series. 
Pelic soils are drier in the soil moisture control section for substantially longer periods during the 120 days following the summer solstice. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: river valleys
Landform: flood plains
Slope: 0 to 2 percent
Elevation: 457 to 1067 meters (1500 to 3500 feet)
Parent material: stratified sandy alluvium
Mean annual air temperature: 8 to 12 degrees C. (46 to 53 degrees F.)
Mean annual precipitation: 43 to 61 centimeters (17 to 24 inches)
Frost-free period: 130 to 160 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bolent; Calamus; Fluvaquents, sandy; and Inavale soils.
Bolent soils: are slightly higher on the floodplain, and are somewhat poorly drained having a seasonal zone of saturation beginning at 46 centimeters (18 inches) 
Calamus soils: are higher on the floodplain and are moderately well drained having a seasonal zone of saturation beginning at 91 centimeters (36 inches)
Fluvaquents soils, sandy: are lowest on the floodplain and are very poorly drained having a seasonal zone of saturation beginning at the surface and having ponding up to 61 centimeters (24 inches) 
Inavale soils: are higher on the floodplain and are excessively drained, not having a seasonal zone of saturation above 183 centimeters (72 inches) 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage: poorly and very poorly
Runoff: negligible
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: very high. 
Ponding frequency: occasional on the very poorly drained soil
Ponding duration: long on the very poorly drained soil with a depth of up to15 centimeters (6 inches)
Flooding frequency: occasional, occasional or frequent on the channeled phase
Flooding duration: brief 

USE AND VEGETATION: The major use is livestock grazing and haying. The native plant community for the wet subirrigated ecological site (RO65XY023NE) is mostly big bluestem, prairie cordgrass, switchgrass, and yellow indiangrass; for the wetland ecological site (R065XY022NE) it is mostly northern reedgrass, sedge, bluejoint, and slender wheatgrass. Some areas are dominated by trees and shrubs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Nebraska and possibly south-central South Dakota. The Almeria series are mostly in LRR G, MLRA 65. The series is of moderate extent. 
MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado 
SERIES ESTABLISHED: Loup County, Nebraska, 1986. 
REMARKS: Diagnostic features recognized in this pedon: 
Aquic soil conditions: 13 to 203 centimeters (5 to 80 inches) (Cg horizons)
Soil moisture regime: aquic
A wet (ponded) phase and a channeled phase are recognized. 
Areas of these soils were mapped as Barney, Loup and Tryon soils in the past. 
Added frequent flooding and minor correction to location.
4/24/2000
Modified the format to semitab.
Modified the taxonomy from Sandy, mixed, mesic Typic Fluvaquent 
9/30/02 PFR:
corrected the family class back to "sandy" based on correspondence with Roger Hammer: "Yes I tend towards Sandy. I just visited with Dave in Valentine and he scanned 23 Almeria 232 descriptions in Cherry Co. Only about 3 out of 23 had loamy (actually fsl) layers above 40 inches. Perhaps the typical pedon needs to be relocated. Also, the loamy layer in the original pedon for the Almeria OSD has 63.5% sand (S85NE115-034). I guess, the location was moved being the one in Loup Co. had a fsl surface which is allowed but maybe not typical for the series.
5/2002 RRZ: Added loamy sand to ROC of Cg horizon 
12/29/2003 WAW: added mucky loam as texture in A horizon 
1/2006 LRM: metric conversion and changed permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity
10/12/2006 RRH: Typical pedon: added thin strata of loamy fine sand and fine sandy loam to A and Cg horizons as per original soils description. Changed 2Cg3 horizon to 2Ab and 3Cg4 horizon to 2Cg; Type Location: corrected quad and lat/long. Range of Characteristics: added mucky fine sandy loam and mucky peat to A horizon and changed thin strata in Cg horizons to of finer or coarser textured layers including mucky mineral and organic layers; Geographically Associated Soils: revised and added Fluvaquents, sandy (associated at type location); Drainage: corrected. Use and Vegetation: corrected.
