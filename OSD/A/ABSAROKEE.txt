ABSAROKEE SERIES

The Absarokee series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or alluvium over residuum from sedimentary rock. These soils are on sedimentary plains, hills, dip slopes, scarp slopes, eroded fan remnants, and escarpments. Slopes are from 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 406 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Absarokee loam, in grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    R--94 cm; hard sandstone interbedded with semiconsolidated shale; strongly cemented to indurated.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Judith Basin County (Judith Basin Area), Montana, 1963.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  
Mollic epipedon - from 0 to 20 cm (A1 and A2 horizons)
Argillic horizon - from 20 to 58 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Paralithic contact - at 66 cm (Cr horizon)
Lithic contact - at 94 cm (R horizon) 
Particle-size control section - from 20 to 58 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)

Absarokee soils have an ustic moisture regime and a frigid temperature regime.

Note: The range in thickness for the Bk horizon and the calcium carbonate equivalent in the range of characteristics allow for a calcic horizon. The presence of a diagnostic calcic horizon needs to be investigated across the extent of the series.
