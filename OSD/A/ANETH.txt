ANETH SERIES

The Aneth series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in eolian deposits and alluvium derived from sandstone. Aneth soils are on valley bottoms, fan terraces, and toeslopes. Slopes are 0 to 16 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 57 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Aneth loamy fine sand, rangeland. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 C1--0 to 7 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) loamy fine sand, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; weak very thick platy structure that parts to single grained; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; few fine discontinuous pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick)

C2--7 to 26 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) loamy fine sand, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary. (15 to 24 inches thick)

C3--26 to 36 inches; reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) fine sandy loam, yellowish red (5YR 5/6) moist; massive; hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; common very fine discontinuous pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 12 inches thick)

C4--36 to 60 inches; reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) loamy fine sand, reddish brown (5YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; common fine and very fine discontinuous pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

TYPE LOCATION: San Juan County, Utah; on the Navajo Indian Reservation about 6 miles south of White Mesa Village; 200 feet north and 100 feet east of the SW corner of sec. 16, T.43S., R.24E., S.L.B.M.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Mean annual soil temperature: 54 degrees to 59 degrees F.
Mean summer soil temperature: 74 degrees to 79 degrees F.
Soil moisture: The soils are usually dry and are not continually moist for more than one-fourth of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. Typic aridic moisture regime
Organic matter content: decreases regularly with depth and is less than 0.2 percent at a depth of 50 inches.
Rock fragment content: 0 to 15 percent.

A horizon (where present)
Hue: 5YR, 2.5YR
Value: 4 to 6 dry, 3 to  6 moist
Chroma: 3 to 6, dry or moist
Reaction: slightly or strongly alkaline
Thickness: 0 to 7 inches thick

C horizon
Hue: 7.5YR, 5YR, 2.5YR
Value:  4 or 7 dry, 4 or  6 moist
Chroma:  2 to 8, dry or moist
Texture: To a depth of 40 inches it averages loamy fine sand bordering loamy very fine sand and contains strata of coarse sand, sand, loamy sand, fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam
Reaction: slightly to very strongly alkaline
Effervescence: slightly to strongly effervescent
Calcium carbonate: The Bk or Ck horizons, where present have less than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent and are at 20 inches depth or greater.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Luning (NV), Shumbegay (AZ), Soda Lake (NV), Soolake (NV) and Yerington (NV) series. Luning soils have hue of 10YR and have gravelly strata in the particle-size control section. Shumbegay soils have SAR values greater than 13 in the profile. Soda Lake soils have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y and have Bk horizons within 20 inches of the surface. Soolake and Yerington soils have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, and in addition Soolake soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 48 to 53 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Aneth soils are on valley bottoms, fan terraces, and toeslopes. Slopes are 0 to 16 percent. These soils formed in alluvium and eolian materials from mixed sources. Elevation ranges from 4,200 to  6,100 feet. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 5 to 11 inches. The mean annual air temperature is about 54 to 57 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is about 78 degrees F. Frost-free period is about 140 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Mota and Sheppard soils. Mota soils have a calcic horizon and average very fine sandy loam in the control section. Sheppard soils have textures of loamy fine sand or coarser in all subhorizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; slow to rapid runoff; rapid or moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used livestock grazing. The vegetation is Indian ricegrass, galleta grass, Russian thistle, alkali sacaton, snakeweed and Mormon tea.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Utah, northern Arizona, and northwest New Mexico. This series is moderately extensive. MLRA 35.
