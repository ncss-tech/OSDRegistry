ALTUS SERIES

The Altus series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy and sandy alluvium of Pleistocene age. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on treads of high stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 16.1 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 610 mm (24 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Pachic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Altus fine sandy loam, on a 1 percent slope, in a cultivated field that has been reseeded to native grasses.
