AUTOMAL SERIES

The Automal series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone, dolomite and shale. Automal soils are on fan remnants and beach plains.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Durinodic Xeric Haplocalcids

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Armespan, Dakent, Morbench, Pyrat and Sugarcreek series.  

Armespan and Dakent soils have appreciable summer moisture, Bw horizons, and mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 14 degrees C.  Morbench soils contain 8 to 13 percent clay, and are moist 10 t0 20 days during July to September due to summer convection storms.  Pyrat soils are 36 to 50 cm deep to calcic horizon and 56 to 80 cm deep to the weakly cemented layer. Sugarcreek have bedrock at 50 to 100 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Automal soils are on fan piedmont remnants and beach plains.  These soils formed in alluvium from limestone, dolomite and shale.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. Elevations are 1,590 to 2,170 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Eastwell, Okan and Wintermute series.  Eastwell soils are shallow to a duripan. Okan soils lack calcic horizons.  Wintermute soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section more than three-fourths of the time (cumulative) that the soil temperature is 5 degrees C. or higher at a depth of 50 centimeters.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high and very high runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly black sagebrush and bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28B
