ASHLEY SERIES

The Ashley series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in coarse-loamy alluvium over fragmental alluvium derived mainly from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.  Ashley soils occur on flood plains and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy over fragmental, siliceous, superactive, calcareous, mesic Aquic Torrifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ashley loam, on a southeast facing, linear, 2 percent slope, in native pasture at an elevation of 5,280 feet.  (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 7 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; many medium and fine roots; few fine and common very fine random tubular pores; strongly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

    A2--7 to l6 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; few medium and fine roots; few fine and common very fine random tubular pores; strongly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to l0 inches thick)

    A3--l6 to 30 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) very fine sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; few medium and fine roots; few fine and very fine random tubular pores; strongly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; few fine faint strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) redox concentrations; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2) ; clear wavy boundary.  (0 to l5 inches thick)

    C1--30 to 36 inches; light brown 7.5YR 6/3) sandy loam, brown (7/5YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; few medium and fine roots; few fine and very fine random tubular pores; slightly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; common medium distinct yellowish brown (l0YR 5/6) redox concentrations; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (5 to 7 inches thick)

2C2--36 to 60 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/3) cobble, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; single grained; loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; few medium and fine roots; many medium and fine interstitial pores, 45 percent cobbles and 40 percent gravel; slightly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; common medium distinct yellowish brown (l0YR 5/6) redox concentrations; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Uintah County, Utah; about 2.5 miles north of Vernal; Vernal NE, Utah USGS quad; 200 feet south and l,500 feet west of the NE corner of Section l0, T.  4 S., R. 2l E., SLBM; 40 degrees, 29 minutes, 44 seconds N. latitude; 109 degrees, 32 minutes, 43 seconds W. longitude.  NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture:  The soil moisture control section is affected by precipitation that falls evenly throughout the year with a slight increase in late summer and early fall.  The soil moisture control section is also influenced by a water table that occurs at 30 to 48 inches deep during the months of March through June from occasional,brief meltwater flooding and from excess run-on from irrigation water from March through November.  The soil moisture regime is considered typic aridic with aquic conditions.
Mean annual soil temperature:  47 to 49 degrees F.
Mean annual summer soil temperature:  64 to 68 degrees F.
Depth to redox concentrations:  16 to 20 inches
Depth to endosaturation: 30 to 48 inches during the months of March through November
Depth to lithologic discontinuity:  30 to 36 inches to cobble and gravel

Particle-size control section (weighted average):  upper part is 10 to 15 percent clay, 0 to 10 percent rock fragments; lower part is 0 to 5 percent clay, 80 to 95 percent rock fragments

A horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR or l0YR
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist
Chroma:  2 or 3 dry or moist

C horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR or l0YR
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma:  2 through 4 dry or moist
Texture:  sandy loam or loam
Rock fragments:  0 to l0 percent rounded gravel

2C horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR or l0YR
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma:  2 through 4 dry or moist
Texture:  cobble and gravel with 5 to 10 percent loamy sand or sand fines
Rock fragments:  80 to 95  percent total rock fragments with 40 to 50 percent cobbles and 30 to 50 percent gravel

COMPETING SERIES:   There are no competing series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material:  coarse-loamy alluvium over fragmental alluvium derived from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks
Landform:  floodplains
Elevation:  5,000 to 5,700 feet
Slope:  0 to 2 percent
Mean annual air temperature:  45 to 47 degrees F.
Mean summer air temperature:  65 to 69 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  6 to 8 inches.
Freeze-free period:  110 to 125 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Wyasket, Robido and Uver soils.  Robido soils have a mollic epipedon.  Uver soils have a sandy-skeletal particle-size control section.  Wyasket soils do not have a lithologic discontinuity.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; very low runoff; moderately rapid permeability in the upper part and rapid permeability below about 36 inches.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for irrigated cropland and pasture.  The vegetation is dominantly quackgrass, wiregrass, cottonwood and willow trees, and scattered big sagebrush.  This soil has been correlated to Semiwet Streambank (Narrowleaf Cottonwood) - 034XY019 range site in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Utah.  LRR D, MLRA 34.  These soils are not extensive.
