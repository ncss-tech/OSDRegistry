AVERETT SERIES

The Averett series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from calcareous sandstone and shale.  Averett soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 25 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 48 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 4.0 degrees C.

Borpark soils are derived from glacially worked basalt and shale.  
Crampton soils are moderately deep to grus and deep to hard granite.  
Curecanti, Ess, Holter, Sawbuck, Sawicki soils do not have a calcic horizon.  Hilger and Shawmut soils have soil moisture control sections affected by peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer.  In addition, Hilger soils are derived from igneous rock and sandstone, and Shawmut soils are derived from till, gravelly alluvium or glaciofluvial deposits.
