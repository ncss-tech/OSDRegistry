AGUST SERIES

The Agust series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils formed in loamy, mixed, gravelly sediments. These nearly level to moderately sloping soils on piedmont slopes, alluvial fans, and high terraces. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 70 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, hyperthermic Ustic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Agust loamy fine sand--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 7 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) loamy fine sand, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; few very fine and fine roots; 10 percent mixed-igneous and sedimentary gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (3 to 10 inches thick)

    Bk1--7 to 20 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; few very fine and fine roots; 25 percent mixed-igneous & sedimentary gravel; coarse fragments coated with calcium carbonate; coatings decrease with depth; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. 

    Bk2--20 to 35 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) gravelly loamy sand, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; single grain; loose, very friable; 25 percent mixed-igneous and sedimentary gravel; 2 percent calcium carbonate coatings on coarse fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bk horizons is 20 to 35 inches.)

    C--35 to 60 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) gravelly fine sandy loam; brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; single grain; loose, very friable; 20 percent mixed igneous & sedimentary gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Agust soils are on early Holocene age piedmont slopes, alluvial fans, and terraces. Slopes are dominantly about 3 percent, but range from 1 to 8 percent. The regolith consists of calcareous, gravelly-textured alluvium derived from igneous and sedimentary alluvium. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 13 inches, and the mean annual air temperature ranges from 68 to 76 degrees F. Frost-free period is 240 to 280 days, and elevation ranges from 1,965 to 3,935 feet. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Equipaje, Mariscal, Ninepoint, and Studybutte soils.  These soils do not have calcic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderately rapid. Runoff is negligible on slopes less than 3 percent, very low on 3 to 5 percent slopes, and low on 5 to 8 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mostly for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and recreation. Vegetation consists of creosotebush, western honey, mesquite, tasajillo, and four-wing saltbush.  Grasses include sand dropseed, fluffgrass, and six-weeks grama.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: In the western part of Trans-Pecos Texas and southern New Mexico. MLRA is 42.  The series is of moderate extent.
