ABOTEN SERIES

The Aboten series consist of shallow over duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash. Aboten soils are on erosional fan piedmont remnants. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Natrargidic Natridurids

TYPICAL PEDON: Aboten very gravelly silt loam. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is partially covered with 35 percent gravel and 3 percent cobbles.

    A--0 to 8 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate thick platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many fine and few medium vesicular pores; 30 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 8 cm thick)

    V--8 to 18 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to strong thin platy; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; many fine and few medium tubular and vesicular pores; 5 percent gravel; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 18 cm thick)

    2Btnk--18 to 38 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak fine and medium prismatic structure parting to weak fine subangular blocky; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; many fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel, 2 percent cobbles; common thin clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; thin lime coatings on undersides of rock fragments; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (10 to 25 cm thick)

    2Bqkm--38 to 69 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) strongly cemented duripan with a thin discontinuous silica laminar cap, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist; massive; very hard, very firm; common very fine roots in some widely spaced fractures; 50 percent gravel, 2 percent cobbles in the matrix; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary. (15 to 53 cm thick)

    3Bk--69 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) extremely gravelly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; 55 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; lime disseminated throughout the horizon; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

TYPE LOCATION: Pershing County, Nevada; approximately 30 miles northwest of Lovelock, in Sage Valley, 200 feet north and 400 feet east of the southwest corner of section 23, T. 29 N., R. 29 E.; latitude 40 degrees 21 minutes 40 seconds N and longitude 118 degrees 41 minutes 4 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees  40.3631667 latitude , -118.685556 longitude.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Monte Cristo series. Monte Cristo soils have within 100 cm unconformable sandy material with less than 40 percent rock fragments immediately below the duripan.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Aboten soils are on erosional fan piedmont remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. Elevations are 1,250 to 1,900 meters. The climate is cool, arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm; mean annual temperature is 9 to 13 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 110 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bluewing, Dorper and Jerval series. These soils are very deep.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained, medium or rapid runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly shadscale, Bailey greasewood, bud sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail and bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Nevada. These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 27.
