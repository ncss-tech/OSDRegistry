ADAIR SERIES

The Adair series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in 25 to 50 centimeters of loess or loess and loamy glacial outwash or erosional sediments and in the underlying paleosol that formed in till.  These soils are on interfluves and side slopes on dissected till plains. Slope ranges from 2 to 30 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 850 millimeters.
