APRON SERIES

The Apron series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or slope alluvium from calcareous sandstone interbedded with shale. These soils are on fan aprons, alluvial fans, fan remnants and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 191 mm, mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Apron fine sandy loam in rangeland at an elevation of 1,587 meters (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

   A--0 to 15 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots throughout; common very fine and fine vesicular pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth boundary. (8 to 20 cm thick)

   C--15 to 152 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) sandy loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Lostwells and Oceanet soils and the competing Worland soils. Lostwells soils are fine-loamy.  Oceanet soils have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 50 cm.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Apron soils are used for irrigated cropland, rangeland, and wildlife habitat. Common crops are barley, dry edible beans, sugar beets, and corn. Native vegetation is needleandthread, Indian ricegrass, blue grama, plains pricklypear, yucca, and Wyoming big sagebrush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Apron soils are extensive in north central Wyoming and south central Montana. MLRA 32, 34A, and 58A.
