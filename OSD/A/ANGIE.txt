ANGIE SERIES

The Angie series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy and clayey sediment on Tertiary-aged uplands.  These soils are on broad, level to strongly sloping coastal plains. Slope is dominantly 1 to 5 percent, but the range is 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1473 mm (58 in) and mean annual temperature is about 18.9 degrees C (66 degrees F)

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, semiactive, thermic Aquic Paleudults

Sawyer soils contain less than 35 percent clay in the upper part of the argillic horizon.  
Shubuta soils do not have aquic conditions within 30 inches of the soil surface.  
Susquehanna soils are somewhat poorly drained and higher shrink-swell potential.  
Vadian and Wilcox soils have smectitic mineralogy and intersecting slickensides within 40 inches of the soil surface.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; slow permeability.  Runoff is medium to rapid.  A water table is at a depth of 2 to 5 feet during winter and early spring.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Almost all areas of Angie soils are in forest of mixed hardwood and pine.   A small amount is used for pasture.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  
Distribution: Coastal Plain of Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Virginia, and possibly Oklahoma and Texas.
