ABSHER SERIES

The Absher series consists of very deep, well and moderately well drained soils that formed in till, glaciofluvial deposits, and in alluvium derived from many sources of geologic materials.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, drainageways, sedimentary plains and till plains.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landforms - alluvial fans; stream terraces; drainageways; sedimentary plains; till plains.

Elevations - 2,000 to 5,200 feet. (Elevations extend up to 8,000 feet in Colorado and Wyoming.)

Slope - 0 to 15 percent.

Parent material - till, glaciofluvial deposits, and alluvium derived from a wide source of geologic materials.

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; hot, dry summers.

Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 14 inches.

Mean annual air temperature - 40 to 45 degrees F.  The mean January temperature is 10 to 25 degrees F, and the mean July temperature is 64 to 72 degrees F.

Frost-free season - 95 to 135 days. (Precipitation is as low as 7 inches in Wyoming.)

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well and moderately well drained; very slow permeability.  The moderately well drained phase has a water table at depths of 3 to 5 feet in the spring.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The Absher soils are used mainly as rangeland.  The native vegetation is western wheatgrass, green needlegrass, inland saltgrass, greasewood, and Nuttall saltbush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  These soils are extensive throughout eastern Montana and in North Dakota, South Dakota, Colorado, and possibly Wyoming.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Cascade County, Montana, 1969.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation records:  MT0067, MT0808, MT0856, MT0716.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - from 0 to 1 inch (E horizon); natric horizon - from 1 to 16 inches (Btn1, Btn2, Btknyz horizons); horizons of salt and gypsum accumulations (Bkyz horizons); particle-size control section - from the top of the argillic horizon to 16 inches (Btn1, Btn2, Btknyz horizons).  Absher soils have an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic and have a frigid temperature regime.
