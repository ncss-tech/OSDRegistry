AFTON SERIES

The Afton series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in 100 to more than 200 centimeters of loess and local alluvium and the underlying till.  These soils are in upland drainageways on dissected till plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 638 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Cherokee County, Iowa, 1924.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 81 centimeters (Ap, A1, A2 and A3 horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 81 to 109 centimeters (Bg1 and Bg2 horizons);
aquic moisture regime.

In MLRA 107A this soil shares limits with the Whitewood series.  Additional work is needed to separate.

Differentia from Sawmill and Whitewood series needs further study and refinement.

A new pedon will be needed.  The pedon used for this OSD does not fit the series pH ranges or depth to carbonates.  The values for pH in the A horizon are slightly higher (8.0) than the slightly alkaline reaction class.  Also, laboratory records indicate effervescence tests confirm the presence of carbonates in some parts of the A horizon.
