MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Rockingham County, North Carolina, l983. 

REMARKS: These soils have varying amounts of non-durable fragments throughout the solum that disintegrate in the laboratory in particle-size analysis. The relative percent of sand, silt, and clay-size particles fluctuates with the degree of agitation in the laboratory. Similar soils with somewhat higher content of non-durable fragments are on the same landscapes. These soils are not extensive enough to identify another series. 

03/13/2003. Ayersville soils are of minor extent (2,500 acres) and have only been correlated in Rockingham County, NC. The official series type location description requires revision to meet present series standards. An extensive review of this series is recommended with the update or maintenance of the soil survey area. 

06/14/2007. The terms used for texture modifiers were changed from rock fragments to pararock fragments to more accurately reflect fragment hardness.  This revision is not a change in the series concept and was not confirmed by re-examination of the pedon.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon)
Cambic horizon--the zone from 8 to 22 inches (Bw horizon) 

Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 30 inches
