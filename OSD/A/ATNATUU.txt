Mean annual soil temperature: 1 to 5 degrees C. (34 to 41 degrees F)
Thickness of organic material: 55 to 90 cm (22 to 35 in)
Depth to aquic conditions: 5 to 15 cm (2 to 6 in)

Oi, Oe and Oa horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 2 to 3
Chroma: 1 to 3
Texture: Slightly decomposed organic material, mucky peat, or muck
Organic matter: 60 to 90 percent
Reaction class: neutral to moderately alkaline (pH 6.6 to 8.4)

C horizon:
Hue: 2.5Y or 5Y
Value: 4 to 5
Chroma: 2 to 5
Texture: Silt loam
Sand: 10 to 48 percent
Silt: 50 to 80 percent

Rock fragments: 0 to 14 percent
Cobbles: 0 to 14 percent
Organic matter: 0.5 to 2 percent
Reaction class: neutral to moderately alkaline (pH 6.6 to 8.4)

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Nonvalnuk (AK) soil.
Nonvalnuk soils do not have a slightly decomposed organic matter surface horizon and are very poorly drained.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Elevation: 200 to 800 meters (655 to 2625 ft)
Parent material: organic material over colluvium and/or till
Landform: mountain slopes
Slopes: 1 to 25 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 300 to 500 mm (12 to 20 in)
Mean annual air temperature: -2 to 1 degrees C. (28 to 34 degrees F)
Frost free period: 89 to 103 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Rocklake, Secondlake, and Taral soils.
Rocklake soils are less than 50cm deep to bedrock and occur on escarpments and mountain slopes.
Secondlake soils are well drained, have a mollic epipedon and occur on mountain slopes.
Taral soils have a deep (>40 cm, 16 in thick) mollic epipedon and occur on mountain slopes with a slope greater than 25 percent.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class: poorly drained
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: very high in the Oi horizon, high in the Oa horizon, moderately high in the C horizon
Permeability: very rapid in the Oi horizon, moderate in the Oa and C horizons
Runoff: very high

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Use: wildlife habitat, recreation, and subsistence
Native vegetation: Alter, meadow horsetail

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 228 Interior Alaska mountains. 
Extent: limited
