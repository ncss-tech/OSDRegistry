AMAROSE SERIES

The Amarose series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils. These soils formed in loamy eolian deposits from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. Amarose soils are on nearly level to gently sloping plains and playa slopes. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 406 mm (16 in), and mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C. (61 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Arizer (T-NM), Berwolf, Delphos (T-NM), Douro, Levelland, Lovington (T-NM) and Ratliff series.
Arizer soils: are on similar landscape positions and have lower color values and chromas and higher organic carbon content in the surface horizons.
Berwolf soils: are on similar landscape positions and have less than 18 percent silicate clay in the particle-size control section.
Delphos, Lovington and Ratliff soils: are on lower landscape positions and do not have an argillic horizon.
Douro soils: are on similar landscape positions and have petrocalcic horizons.
Levelland soils: are on lower landscape positions, do not have an argillic horizon and are moist in the soil moisture control section for longer periods.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained and moderate permeability. Runoff is negligible on slopes of less than 1 percent and low on 1 to 5 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used primarily for rangeland and small areas of irrigated cropland. Where cultivated, the principal crops are small grains and grain sorghum. Climax vegetation in rangeland is mainly short and mid grasses, with mid grasses tending to dominate, with a smaller tall grass component. This site is dominated by blue grama with lesser amounts of sideoats grama, buffalograss, little bluestem, gaura, plains zinnia, prairieclover, bundleflower, wild alfalfa, and ephedra. Woody plants include catclaw sensitivebrier, yucca, and sand sagebrush. Dominant vegetation on the loamy fine sands includes sideoats grama, bluestems, and switchgrass, and on the fine sandy loams includes sideoats grama, blue grama, buffalograss, and Arizona cottontop. This soil has been correlated to the Sandy Loam (R077DY047TX) and Sandy (R077DY046TX) ecological sites in MLRA-77D.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern High Plains, Southern Part (MLRA 77D in LRR H) of eastern New Mexico. The series is extensive.

REMARKS: This is a Benchmark Series. The Amarose series was formerly included in the Amarillo series. Classification change from Aridic Haplustalfs to Ustic Calciargids based on an evaluation of the geographic extent of these soils, and the climate in which they occur. Cation exchange activity class placement in the superactive class is based on laboratory data from the type location, and laboratory data from similar and adjacent soils. The average of the control section is 0.58. Since adjacent and similar soils are in the superactive class, the decision is made to place this soil in the superactive cation exchange activity class. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 26 cm (0 to 10 in) Ap horizons
Argillic Horizon: 26 to 203 cm (10 to 80 in) Bt and Btk horizons
Calcic horizon: 106 to 203 cm (42 to 80 in) Btk horizons
