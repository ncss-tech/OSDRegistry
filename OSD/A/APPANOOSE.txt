APPANOOSE SERIES

The Appanoose series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in loess.  These soils are on nearly level interfluves on dissected till plains and treads on high loess-covered stream terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 955 millimeters.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Appanoose County, Iowa, 1970.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 38 to 88 centimeters (Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, and Btg4 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (Ap, E, BE, Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, Btg4, and BCg1 horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 36 centimeters (Ap and E horizons);
albic horizon--the zone from a depth of 20 to 36 centimeters (E horizon);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 38 to 104 centimeters (Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, and Btg4 horizons);
aquic moisture regime.

Some pedons do not have the 20 percent clay increase within a depth of 7.5 centimeters (as required for abrupt clay increase), but maximum clay content of the argillic horizon is twice as much as  the clay content of the overlying horizons.
