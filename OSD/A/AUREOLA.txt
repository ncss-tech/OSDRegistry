AUREOLA SERIES

The Aureola series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed on uplands in 50 to 100 centimeters (19.7 to 39.4 inches) of loamy sediments that overlie sandy material weathered from calcareous sandstone.  Slope ranges from 0 to 16 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 840 millimeters (33.1 inches).
