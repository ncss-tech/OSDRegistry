AYCOCK SERIES

The Aycock series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately or moderately slowly permeable soils on uplands of the Middle and Lower Coastal Plain.  They formed in loamy marine sediments.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Near the type location, mean annual precipitation is 48 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 63 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, siliceous, subactive, thermic Typic Paleudults

TYPICAL PEDON:  Aycock very fine sandy loam--cultivated.
(Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

     Ap--0 to 7 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very fine sandy loam; weak medium granular structure; very friable; many fine roots; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

     E--7 to 12 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very fine sandy loam, weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; few fine roots; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

     Bt1--12 to 17 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.

     Bt2--17 to 30 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) clay loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable, sticky plastic; thin patchy clay films on faces of peds; gradual wavy boundary.

     Bt3--30 to 50 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) clay loam;  weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few faint clay films on faces of peds; few medium faint light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) iron depletions; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

     Bt4--50 to 75 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly sticky; few faint clay films on faces of peds; few slightly firm brown nodules; common medium distinct pale brown (10YR 6/3) iron depletions; and common medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), and a few prominent red (2.5YR 4/6) masses of iron accumulation; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 40 to 72 inches.)

     BC--75 to 90 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) loam; massive; friable; slightly sticky; few medium, firm and soft plinthite nodules; many medium prominent light gray (10YR 7/2) iron depletions, and red (2.5YR 4/6) masses of iron accumulation;  very strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Wayne County, North Carolina; one mile north of Fremont on U. S. Highway 117, and 200 feet west of junction of County Roads 1361 and 117.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 60 inches.  The soil is strongly acid or very strongly acid throughout except where the surface has been limed.  The lower B and C horizons, in many pedons, contain plinthite nodules, but no horizon within 60 inches of the surface has as much as 5 percent plinthite.

The Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam.

The E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam.

The Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Iron depletions in shades of brown or yellow may occur in any part of the Bt horizon except the Bt1.  Iron depletions in shades of gray may occur in the Bt horizon below a depth of 30 inches.  Masses of iron accumulation in shades of brown or red may occur anywhere in the Bt horizon.  Some pedons have a Btg horizon below a depth of 48 inches that has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has masses of iron accumulation in shades of red, yellow, or brown.  Texture is commonly clay loam, but includes loam, silt loam, and silty clay loam.  Thin layers of clay or silty clay are in some pedons.

The BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Iron depletions in shades of yellow, brown, or gray may occur, as well as masses of iron accumulation in shades of red or brown.  The texture range is the same as for the Bt horizon.

The C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Iron depletions in shades of yellow, brown or gray occur, as well as masses of iron accumulation in shades of red, yellow, or brown.  Texture is variable.

The Cg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has masses of iron accumulation in shades of red, yellow, or brown.  Texture is variable.

COMPETING SERIES:  Soil series in same family are Bewleyville, Blevins, Curtistown, Mountview, and Silerton.  Bewleyville, Curtistown, and Mountview soils have Bt and/or 2Bt horizon in hue of 2.5YR or 5YR.  Blevins soils have B horizons with a bisequum clay distribution.  Silerton soils have a lithologic discontinuity with silty material 1.5 to 3 feet thick overlying clayey coastal plain sediments.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Aycock soils are nearly level to gently sloping, and are on uplands of the Middle and Lower Coastal Plain.  Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent.  The soil formed in loamy coastal plain sediments.  Mean annual precipitation is 48 inches near the type location and the mean annual air temperature is about 63 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include Exum, Goldsboro, Grantham, Nahunta, Noboco, Norfolk, and Orangeburg soils.  Exum and Goldsboro soils are moderately well drained and are slightly lower or further from drainageways than Aycock soils.  The somewhat poorly drained Nahunta soils and the poorly drained Grantham soils are in depressions or further from drainageways on the landscape.  The well drained Nobocco and Norfolk soils are in the same landscape positions as Aycock.  The well drained Orangeburg soils are higher or nearer to drainageways than Aycock soils.  In addition, Nobocco, Norfolk and Orangeburg soils are in a fine-loamy family.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff; permeability is moderate or moderately slow.

USE AND VEGETATION:  About two-thirds of the total acreage is used for growing cotton, corn, soybeans, tobacco, peanuts, truck crops, and small grains.  The remainder is in pasture or is forested.  Common trees include loblolly pine, longleaf pine, southern red oak, and white oak.  Understory plants include American holly, flowering dogwood, blueberry, greenbrier, and persimmon.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Coastal Plain of North Carolina and Virginia.  The series is moderately extensive.
