ALAMEDAWELL SERIES

The Alamedawell series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium and eolian sand over lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic ash.  Alamedawell soils are on lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: The soil between depths of 30 and 91 cm is usually dry from mid-May until mid-November and is moist in some part the rest of the time. The soil temperature is above 5 degrees C. from April 1 to December 20, and is above 8.3 degrees C. from April 15 to November 30.  Summer thunderstorms occur, but are spotty and usually do not wet the moisture control section; aridic (or torric) moisture regime that borders on xeric.
Soil temperature: 8.3 to 11.1 degrees C.
Depth to the stratified lacustrine deposits: 50 to 100 cm.
Volcanic glass content: 60 to 80 percent in the A horizon and upper C horizons and 30 to 50 percent in the lower C horizon formed in lake sediments; Sands are glassy shards of rhyolitic volcanic ash
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 5 percent.
Other features: The soil surface is covered with 5 to 10 percent pumice gravel.

Other features: Thin 3 to 6 mm thick discontinuous silica-cemented zones are present in some pedons; Masses of iron accumulation with high chroma, which are relict redoximorphic features, are present in some pedons.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Lakash series.  Lakash soils have a typic aridic (torric) moisture regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Alamedawell soils are on lake terraces with hummocky microrelief.  Dunes are associated with these soils in most areas. They formed in rhyolitic volcanic ash that was deposited by wind over finer-textured lacustrine sediments. The ash has since been reworked by wind and water. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,955 to 2,170 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, much of it as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 7.2 to 10 degrees C, the mean January temperature is about 2.2 degrees C, and the mean July temperature is about 18.9 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 100 to 135 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brantel and Deepwell soils.  These soils do not have loamy strata in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; very low surface runoff; rapid over moderate or moderately slow permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.  This soil is stratified and has underlying sodic lacustrine sediments.  

USE AND VEGETATION:  Alamedawell soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Present vegetation is big sagebrush, horsebrush, black greasewood, rubber rabbitbrush, annual forbs, Indian ricegrass, needleandthread, and inland saltgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The Mono Valley in eastern California. These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 26.
