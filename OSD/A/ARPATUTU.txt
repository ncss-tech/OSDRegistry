ARPATUTU SERIES

The Arpatutu series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from phyllite, schist, and other metasedimentary rocks. The Arpatutu soils are on mountain slopes and hills, and in canyons. Slopes range from 15 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 955 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, semiactive, mesic Ultic Haploxeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Arpatutu loam on a northwest-facing, convex, 20 percent slope under foothill pine, ponderosa pine, manzanita, and mountain misery at an elevation of 756 meters. (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted. When described on March 24, 2015 the soil was slightly moist throughout).

 Bt3--40 to 71 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely flaggy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; common medium, coarse, and very coarse roots throughout; common very fine tubular pores; 25 percent prominent clay films on bottom surfaces of rock fragments and 40 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 40 percent angular strongly cemented schist channers, 35 percent angular strongly cemented schist flagstones; strongly acid (pH 5.4); very abrupt smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of upper Bt horizons is 15 to 55 cm)

 R--71 to 200 cm; indurated schist bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family at this time. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Arpatutu soils are on the upper third of mountainflanks on mountain slopes, on headslopes of high hills, and in canyons. Slopes range from 15 to 90 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from phyllite, schist, and other metasedimentary rocks. Elevation is 330 to 1330 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is about 800 to 1225 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 13 to 16 degrees C. The frost free season is 180 to 285 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Lickinfork, Nedsgulch, and Wallyhill soils. The Lickinfork soils are greater than 150 cm to bedrock and are on mountainflanks. Nedsgulch soils are greater than 150 cm to bedrock and are on sideslopes of hills and on mountainflanks. The Wallyhill soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section and are on nose slopes of hills and upper third of mountainflanks. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high throughout the profile.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Vegetation is sugar pine, ponderosa pine, incense cedar, California black oak, deerbrush, Pacific dogwood, and mountain misery.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Foothills in California; MLRA 18. The series is moderately extensive.
