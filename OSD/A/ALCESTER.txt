ALCESTER SERIES 

The Alcester series consists of very deep, well and moderately well drained soils formed in silty colluvial-alluvial sediments on terraces, foot slopes and flood plains. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 610 millimeters (24 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C (48 degrees F).

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Rock County, Minnesota, 1945.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon: 
mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of about 86 centimeters (34 inches - Ap, A, Bw1, Bw2
horizons); 
cambic horizon-the zone from 86 to 127 centimeters (34 to 50 inches).

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from
similar soils in the surrounding area.
