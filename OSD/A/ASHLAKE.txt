ASHLAKE SERIES

The Ashlake series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in till which, in places, shows incorporated traces of glaciolacustrine deposits. These soils formed in plane and slightly convex surfaces on ground moraines, end moraines, and bedrock controlled moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 660 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Aquic Glossudalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Ashlake loam on a plane slope of 2 percent under mixed aspen forest. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   A--0 to 2 centimeters; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; moderate fine granular structure; friable; common fine and medium roots throughout; 2 percent gravel; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 13 centimeters thick)

   E--2 to 10 centimeters; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; moderate thick platy structure; friable; common very fine and fine roots throughout; 2 percent gravel; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 15 centimeters thick)

   Bt2--46 to 66 centimeters; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silty clay; strong fine and medium angular blocky structure; firm; common fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) Fe concentrations and common fine distinct dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) Fe depletions; few distinct very dark brown (10YR 2/2) clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 2 percent gravel; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (combined Bt horizon is 36 to 76 centimeters thick)

   Bk1--66 to 112 centimeters; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silty clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine and medium distinct brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) Fe concentrations and common fine distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) Fe depletions; carbonates disseminated throughout; strongly effervescent; 2 percent gravel; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary. (0 to 46 centimeters thick)

   Bk2--112 to 203 centimeters; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) silty clay loam; massive; friable; few fine and medium distinct brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) Fe concentrations and common fine distinct gray (2.5Y 6/1) Fe depletions; common medium and coarse light gray (10YR 7/2) carbonate threads throughout; violently effervescent; 2 percent gravel; strongly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Major Land Resources Area (MLRA) 93A-Superior Stony and Rocky Loamy Plains and Hills, Western Part; St. Louis County, Minnesota (Crane Lake subset); about 8 miles east and 2 miles south of Ray; located about 675 feet west and 2,150 feet south of the NE corner of section 20, T.68 N.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to 2 centimeters (A horizon);
albic horizon--the zone from 2 to 10 centimeters (E horizon);
glossic horizon-the zone from 10 to 23 centimeters (E/B horizon);
argillic horizon--the zone from 23 to 66 centimeters (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons);
aquic subgroup--based on 2 chroma redox features in the upper 25 centimeters of the Bt horizon.

This soil could be challenged as having an Aquertic subgroup class.
The mean clay content was used for classifying this soil.
