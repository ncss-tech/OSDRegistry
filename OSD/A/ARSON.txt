ARSON SERIES

The Arson series consists of deep, well drained soils on side slopes, shoulders and ridge summits of foothills and low mountains. They formed in material from fine grained quartzites and siltite of the Libby, Striped Peak and Prichard formations of the Belt supergroup that is blanketed by a thin mantle of mixed volcanic ash and loess. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Slope ranges from 5 to 60 percent. The average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 31 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Arson soils are on side slopes, shoulders and ridge summits of foothills and low mountains. Slopes range from 8 to 65 percent. These soils formed in fine grained quartzites or siltite with a thin mantle of mixed volcanic ash and loess at elevations of 2,250 to 4,310 feet (686 to 1314 meters). The average annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 49 degrees F, with an average annual precipitation of 23 to 37 inches (584 to 940 mm). The frost free season is 95 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Stewah (T), Carlinton, Sinkler (T) and Carrico (T) soils. Stewah soils have a udic moisture regime and are on side slopes of foothills and low mountains. Carlinton soils have a fragipan and are on hillsides and summits of broad intrerfluves. Sinkler soils are very deep and are on linear and concave backslopes of foothills and low mountains. Carrico soils are moderately deep, do not have siltite fragments and parafragments in the subsoil and are on mountain side slopes and ridges.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, watershed, and recreation. Potential natural vegetation is Douglas-fir, grand fir and ponderosa pine with an understory of oceanspray, mallow ninebark, pinegrass, common snowberry, dwarf rose, white spirea, American trailplant and woodland strawberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North-central Idaho. The series is moderately extensive. MLRA 43A and 9.
