ACUFF SERIES

The Acuff series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils. These soils formed in loamy eolian sediments in the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. Acuff soils are on nearly level to gently sloping plains and playa slopes. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 483 mm (19 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (60 degrees F).

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained and moderate permeability. Surface runoff is negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes and low on 1 to 5 percent slopes. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used for crop production. Principal crops are cotton, sorghum, and winter wheat. A considerable amount of acreage is irrigated. Climax vegetation is dominantly short grasses with a few mid grasses and includes blue grama and buffalograss, with lesser amounts of vine-mesquite, western wheatgrass, sideoats grama, galleta, or tobosa, silver bluestem, wild alfalfa, and prairie clover. This soil has been correlated to the Deep Hardland (R077CY022TX) ecological site in MLRA-77C. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern High Plains, Southern Part (MLRA 77C in LRR H) of western Texas and eastern New Mexico. The series is extensive.

REMARKS: This is a Benchmark Series. 
Keys to Soil Taxonomy, tenth edition, classifies this series as an Aridic Argiustolls. The series has a silicate clay decrease exceeding 20 percent due to 
dilution by secondary calcium carbonate. A proposal to maintain "pale" status 
for such soils on old stable landscapes has been submitted to the National 
Leader for Soil Taxonomy and Standards. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 30 cm (0 to 12 in) (Ap horizon) 
Argillic horizon: 30 to 203 cm (12 to 80 in) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Btkk, Btk horizons) 
Calcic horizon: 97 to 203 cm (38 to 80 in) (Btkk, Btk) 
Plugged (kk) horizon: 97 to 51 cm (38 to 58 in) (Btkk) 
Note: the kk feature is defined as pedogenic carbonate accumulation that is characterized by laterally continuous carbonates that have engulfed rock, sand, silt, and clay particles; plugged the macroporosity of the soil horizon with 50 percent or more calcium carbonate; and obliterated the original soil structure.
