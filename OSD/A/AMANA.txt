Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 38 centimeters (0 to 15 inches) (Ap and A horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 38 to 142 centimeters (15 to 56 inches) (Bg1, Bg2, Bg3, Bg4, and BCg horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
