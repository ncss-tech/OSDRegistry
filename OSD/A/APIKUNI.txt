APIKUNI SERIES

The Apikuni series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rock. These soils are on moraines. Slopes range from 4 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1,100 millimeters, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3.0 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Typic Haplocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Apikuni silt loam in aspens on a 7 percent slope at an elevation of 1,503 meters. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 A--0 to 15 cm; brown (7.5YR4/2) silt loam, very dark gray (7.5YR 3/1) moist; moderate coarse granular structure; friable, slightly hard, very sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots throughout; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 1 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual smooth boundary.

 Bw1--15 to 42 cm; gray (10YR 5/1) clay loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; firm, hard, very sticky and very plastic; many fine and medium roots throughout;  common very fine and fine irregular pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.7); gradual smooth boundary.

 Bw2--42 to 82 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly clay loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; firm, hard, very sticky and very plastic; many very fine and fine roots throughout; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 15 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.9); gradual wavy boundary.

 BC--82 to 95 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; firm, hard, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine roots throughout; common very fine and few fine irregular pores; 25 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.1); gradual wavy boundary.

 C--95 to 150 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) gravelly loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; massive; friable, moderately hard, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots throughout; few very fine and fine irregular pores; 30 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2).

COMPETING SERIES: 
Chelina (AK): have a lithologic discontinuity
Chetaslina (AK):do not have a cambic horizon 
Nimerick (CO): are moderately deep to a lithic contact
Ripple (CO): have a lithologic discontinuity 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform: moraines 
Elevation: 1,400 to 1,900 meters 
Slope: 4 to 35 percent 
Parent material: till derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rock 
Climate: long, cold winters; moist springs; short warm summers with May and June receiving the most precipitation 
Mean annual precipitation: 800 to 1,500 mm 
Mean annual air temperature: 1.0 to 5.5 degrees C. 
Frost-free period: 30 to 65 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained and moderate permeability (5 to 15 um/sec). 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are typically forested and are used mainly for recreation and wildlife. The vegetation is typified by an open to moderately closed overstory of Douglas-fir with a diverse and multilayered understory of shrubs, grasses and forbs including white spirea, common snowberry, pinegrass and heartleaf arnica. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Apikuni soils are of limited extent in northern Montana. MLRA 43A and 43B.
