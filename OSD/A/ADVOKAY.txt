ADVOKAY SERIES

The Advokay series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from coarse grained tuff, rhyolite, granitic and related rocks.  Advokay soils are on mountain slopes, hills and pediments.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Typic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Advokay gravelly coarse sandy loam, rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The surface pavement is covered with 50 percent gravel.

    A1--0 to 3 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine and fine vesicular and interstitial pores; 25 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 5 cm thick)

    A2--3 to 8 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong very thick platy structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine and fine vesicular pores; 10 percent gravel; few faint clay films lining pores in the lower part of the horizon; violently effervescent moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 13 cm thick)

    Btkq--8 to 18 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine, few medium roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 25 percent gravel; common distinct clay films lining pores; common thin carbonate and silica pendants on gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (8 to 23 cm thick)

    Cr--18 to 28 cm; weathered, very highly fractured tuffaceous rock; few very fine roots in fractures.

TYPE LOCATION:  Esmeralda County, Nevada; about 2,000 feet east 400 feet north of the southwest corner of section 12, T. 2 N., R. 43 E., USGS Tonopah 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 02 minutes 10 seconds N and longitude 117 degrees 12 minutes 58 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.0361111 latitude, -117.2161111 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in some part for short periods during winter and early spring and for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October due to convection storms, typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 15 degrees C.
Depth to the paralithic: 10 to 36 cm.
Reaction: Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.
Effervescence: Calcareous in all parts, ranges from slightly effervescent to violently effervescent.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 18 to 27 percent.
Rock fragments:  15 to 35 percent, mainly 2 to 5 mm diameter.

A horizon
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4.

Bt horizon
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4.
Clay content:  20 to 35 percent.
Consistence: Slightly plastic or plastic
Rock fragments:  15 to 35 percent, mainly 2 to 5 mm in diameter. Subhorizons may range from 10 to 45 percent in some pedons.
Other features:  Carbonate and silica pendants are common on undersides of gravel in most pedons.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Monierco series.  Monierco soils have a noncalcareous argillic horizon, less than 15 percent rock fragments, and lacks silica pendants and coatings.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Advokay soils are on mountain slopes, hills and pediments.  The soils formed in residuum derived from coarse grained tuffs, rhyolite, breccia, granite and related rocks, with minor amounts of alluvium and colluvium  derived from mixed rock sources in some pedons.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent. Elevation ranges from 1,178 to 2,135 meters.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 10 to 12 degrees C, the mean annual precipitation ranges from 100 to 200 mm and the frost-free season is 100 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Itme, Pintwater and Stewval soils.  Itme soils lack an argillic horizons and are deep.  Pintwater and Stewval series are both shallow over hard rock and contain more than 35 percent rock fragments.  Also, Pintwater also lack argillic horizons; Stewval soils have an aridic moisture regimes bordering on xeric.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; runoff is rapid or medium; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing.  The present vegetation is mainly shadscale, Indian ricegrass, Bailey greasewood, bud sagebrush and Nevada ephedra.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwest Nevada.  These soils are of small extent.  MLRA 29.
