COMPETING SERIES:  There are no series in the same family. Similar soils are the Camptown, Evadale, Kinder, and Leton series. 

Camptown, Evadale, Kinder and Leton soils: have glossic horizons

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loamy fluviomarine sediments derived from the Beaumont Formation of Pleistocene age
Landscape: flat coastal plains
Landform: flats
Microfeature: leveled mounds
Slope: 0 to 1 percent
Soil Moisture: An aquic soil moisture regime. 
Mean annual soil temperature: 21.7 to 22.0 degrees C (71 to 72 degrees F)
Mean annual air temperature range: 20.0 to 22.0 degrees C (68 to 72 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation range: 1194 to 1575 mm (48 to 62 in)
Precipitation Pattern: Rainfall is fairly uniform throughout the year with slight peaks in the fall and spring months. 
Frost-free period: 270 to 300 days
Elevation: 3 to 30.5 m (10 to 100 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Anahuac, Labelle, Levac, Orcadia, Meaton, Morey, and Spindletop series.

Anahuac and Orcadia soils: are on a broader landform
Labelle, Meaton, and Morey soils: somewhat poorly drained; on flats
Levac soils- somewhat poorly drained; are truncated pimple mounds
Spindletop soils: moderately well drained; on pimple mounds

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage class: poorly
Permeability class:
Runof: negligible. 
Flooding: soils are rarely flooded for very brief to brief periods. Flooding occurs as a result of storm surge during tropical storms which occurs in areas less than 4.6 m (15 ft) elevation. 
Wetness: soils have episaturation from the soil surface to 91 cm (0 to 36 in) from January to March and endosaturation from 100 to 203 cm (40 to 80 in) below the surface during the same period.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Aris soils are used mainly for cropland and native pasture.  Cropland is dominantly in rice production with a few small areas used for growing cotton, corn, and grain sorghum.  Native grasses are mainly paspalums, sedges and rushes.  Loblolly pine trees have encroached on a few areas.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Gulf Coast Prairie of Texas east of the Trinity River and possibly in Louisiana; Land Resource Region T; MLRA 150A; the series is of moderate extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Harris County, Texas; 1973.

REMARKS:  These soils were formerly included in the Crowley series.  The series type location was moved from Harris County to Jefferson County in 1995.  A study of the series in 1994 indicated that 2 to 3 series concepts have been mapped into the Aris series.  This revision limits the series to the original concept of the series.  New series will be proposed to define the Aris soils mapped on mounded and depressional positions.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 26 cm (0 to 10 in) (A and AE horizons).
Argillic horizon: 26 to 203 cm (10 to 80 in) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Btg1, Btg2, Btg3 horizons).
Aquic moisture regime: Dominant chroma of 2 or less and iron accumulations due to wetness in the A and AE horizons from January to March in normal years.

Additional Comments: The previous versions of the Aris series were classified as Typic Glossaqualfs. During the update of MLRA 150A, it was determined that previously identified glossic material was dominantly crawfish krotovinas. The particle-size family was changed from fine to fine-silty as the result of lab data on pedons throughout the series province.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  KSSL data exists on pedon S11TX2452366 from the type location in Jefferson County, Texas.
