AFFEY SERIES

The Affey series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks, loess, and volcanic ash. Affey soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 4 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TYPE LOCATION:  Elko County, Nevada; about 30 miles north of Pequop; about 7,900 feet north and 1,000 feet east of the northwest corner of section 1, T. 42 N., R. 65 E.; USGS Knoll Mountain SE 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 41 degrees 34 minutes 52 seconds N and longitude 114 degrees 33 minutes 52 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 41.5811111 latitude, -114.5644444 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist in the winter and spring, dry from early July through October; aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon: 25 to 40 cm, may include the upper part of the argillic horizon in some pedons.
Depth to identifiable secondary carbonates: 46 to 100 cm.
Depth to base of argillic horizon and upper boundary of horizon with weak silica cementation: 66 to 100 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 35 to 45 percent. 
Rock fragments:  Averages 35 to 50 percent, mainly gravel with up to 10 percent cobbles and stones. Lithology of fragments are mixed, but may be dominated by volcanic rocks such as tuff, andesite, and rhyolite.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Homestake series. Homestake soils have 50 to 70 percent rock fragments in the upper 50 cm of the argillic horizon, identifiable secondary carbonates between 33 and 50 cm, and do not have manganese concretions within the argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Affey soils are on fan remnants. They typically occur on summit and shoulder positions. They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks, loess, and volcanic ash. Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,710 to 2,320 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cleavage and Gollaher soils. Cleavage soils are loamy-skeletal, shallow to lithic contacts, and have mollic epipedons and argillic horizons. Gollaher soils are loamy-skeletal, very shallow to lithic contacts, and have carbonatic mineralogy.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained; high surface runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Affey soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, Nevada bluegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, Indian ricegrass, and scattered Utah juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Nevada. These soils are not extensive with about 2,700 acres of the series mapped to date. MLRA 25.
