AUGER SERIES

The Auger series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy glaciolacustrine deposits. These soils are on lake plains. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 810 millimeters. Mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: coarse-silty, isotic, frigid Oxyaquic Haplorthods

TYPICAL PEDON: Auger silt loam on a 3 percent slope in a forested area at an elevation of 229 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

  Oe--0 to 5 centimeters; partially decomposed leaf litter; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine to coarse roots; extremely acid; abrupt wavy boundary.

  E--5 to 13 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 5/2) silt loam, pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine to coarse roots; common charcoal fragments; extremely acid; abrupt irregular boundary. (5 to 13 centimeters thick)

  Bhs--13 to 15 centimeters; black (5YR 2.5/1) silt loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine to coarse roots; occasional charcoal fragments; extremely acid; abrupt irregular boundary. (2 to 8 centimeters thick)

  Bs1--15 to 28 centimeters; mixed dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) and reddish brown (5YR 4/4) silt loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine to coarse roots; occasional charcoal fragments; extremely acid; clear irregular boundary. (10 to 20 centimeters thick)

  Bs2--28 to 38 centimeters; mixed yellowish red (5YR 4/6) and yellowish red (5YR 5/6) silt loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine to coarse roots; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. (10 to 20 centimeters thick)

  BC--38 to 64 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very fine sandy loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine and medium roots; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. (15 to 30 centimeters thick)

  C1--64 to 160 centimeters; pale brown (10YR 6/3), light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) and brown (7.5YR 5/4) stratified silt loam and silt; weak thick platy structure inherent from deposition; friable; common medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) and strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) masses of iron accumulation; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. (64 to 102 centimeters thick)

  C2--160 to 203 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 5/3) and brown (7.5YR 5/4) silt; weak thick platy structure inherent from deposition; friable; common medium and coarse prominent yellowish red (5YR 5/6) and yellowish red (5YR 5/8) masses of iron accumulation; very strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION: Luce County, Michigan; 650 feet north of the southeast corner of sec. 17, T.48N., R.8W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The particle-size control section averages less than 5 percent clay. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to very strongly acid in the solum and very strongly acid to moderately acid in the substratum.

The E horizon has hue of 7.5YR, value of 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam or silt

The Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2.5 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.

The Bs1 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4.

The Bs2 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6.

The BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is very fine sandy loam or silt loam.

The C1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is stratified silt loam, silt, or very fine sandy loam.

The C2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam or silt.

Sandy substratum phases are included in the range of this series.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Auger soils are on lake plains. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 710 to 910 millimeters. Mean annual temperature ranges from 5 to 6 degrees F. Elevations range from 213 to 231 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Annanias, Zandi, Hendrie, and Markey soils. The somewhat poorly drained Annanias and poorly drained Hendrie soils are on lower landscape positions. The well drained Zandi soils are on hills and ridges. The very poorly drained Markey soils are in depressions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. These soils have representative wet soil moisture status that ranges from 76 to 137 centimeters below the surface in October, November, March, April, May, and June. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high. Surface runoff ranges from negligible to medium, dependent on slope.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of this soil are forested. Common trees are red maple, American beech, eastern hemlock, sugar maple, yellow birch, quaking aspen, balsam fir, and white spruce. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern and Central Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This series is of small extent.
