GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Appoquinimink soils are mineral soils with a buried organic horizon 20 centimeters or more thick within 100 centimeter of the soil surface 
Broadkill soils are mineral soils which occur in adjacent or back bay tidal marshes
Hooksan soils do not have a seasonal high water table above 183 cm (72 inches); on same landscape positions
Mispillion soils have 41 to 130 centimeters (16 to 51 inches) of organic soil materials which occur on adjacent or back bay tidal marshes
Purnell soils are mineral soils with 20 to 41 centimeters (8 to 16 inches) of organic materials
Saltpond soils are mineral soil on lower landscape positions
Transquaking soils have with 130 centimeters (51 inches) organic soil materials which occur in adjacent or back bay tidal marshes

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage Class (Agricultural): Excessively drained
Internal Free Water Occurrence: Very deep and absent
Index Surface Runoff: Very low
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity Class: High to very high 
Shrink-swell Potential: Low
Flooding Frequency and Duration: Occasional and very brief periods, mainly during coastal storm events

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Major Uses: Some areas are cleared and managed to maintain an adequate dune line for protection and for recreational purposes. Most areas are in a natural vegetated condition for wildlife.
Where vegetated-- Native vegetation includes American beachgrass (Ammophila breviligulata), sea rocket (Cakile edentula), seaside goldenrod (Solidago sempervirens), bayberry (Morella pensylvanica), sea myrtle (Baccharis halimifolia), and shore juniper (Juniperus virginiana).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Worcester County, Maryland, 1995.

REMARKS:
This soil was formerly included in the Coastal Beaches miscellaneous area. 
The following changes have been made on the 12/2012 revision:
1)	Revisions to formatting and data consistency with NASIS.
2)	Revisions made to include NASIS information and laboratory data
3)	The location was revised from latitude 38 degrees 10 minutes 0.0 seconds N. and 75 degrees 9 minutes 0.0 seconds W. to latitude 38 degrees 38 minutes 0.0 seconds N. and 75 degrees 9 minutes 55.0 seconds W. place the pedon in the proper mapunit

The following changes have been made on the 2/2019 revision:
1) 	The type location was moved from MD to DE.  
2)	The location was revised from latitude 38 degrees 10 minutes 0.0 seconds N. and 75 degrees 9 minutes 55 seconds W. to latitude 38 degrees 38 minutes 5.47 seconds N. and 75 degrees 3 minutes 59.41 seconds W. as the former pedon classified as Quartzipsamment.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

1.	Ochric epipedon: the zone from 0 to 10 centimeters (0 to 4 inches).

2.	At this time, there appears to be conflicting family placement based upon past mineralogical test results which could potentially affect Subgroup classification. Report suggest that grain counts for mineralogy taxa placement can differ depending upon which fraction are analyzed .i.e. fine sands verse medium sands. Refer to publication Mineralogical Determination for Family Placement: Our Experience on the Coastal Plain; by Rabenhorst, Marty and Shields, D.A., Soil Survey Horizons, p. 59 -65, Summer 1996
