ALMENA SERIES

The Almena series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in 100 to 150 centimeters of loess or silty alluvium and in the underlying loamy till. These soils are on flats, toeslopes, and footslopes on ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.
