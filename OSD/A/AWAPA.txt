AWAPA SERIES

The Awapa series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and/or slope alluvium derived from igneous rock.  Awapa soils are on hills.  Slopes range from 25 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 250 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Haplustolls	

TYPICAL PEDON:  Awapa extremely cobbly loam, on a northwest facing, convex, 40 percent slope in Wyoming big sagebrush and fringed sagebrush at an elevation of 2,290 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The surface is covered by 15 percent fine gravel, 15 percent medium and coarse gravel, 20 percent cobble, and 20 percent stones.

(18 to 30 cm thick)

    Bk2--46 to 84 cm; pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2), extremely gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 5/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic; few very and few fine roots; common very fine and few fine tubular pores; many very fine and fine irregular carbonate masses, many fine and medium carbonate concretions around rock fragments; 20 percent fine gravel, 40 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; violently effervescent (13 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (combined thickness of Bk horizons is 60 to 80 cm)

    CBk--84 to 152 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/3), extremely gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 45 percent fine gravel, 30 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent (7 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), common fine and very fine irregular carbonate masses and fine carbonate concretions on bottom of rock fragments; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8).
