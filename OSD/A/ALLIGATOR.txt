ALLIGATOR SERIES

The Alligator series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in clayey alluvium.  Alligator soils are on backswamps, swales of meander scrolls, sloughs, and floodplains on the meander belts of the Mississippi River and its tributaries in the Lower Mississippi Valley. Slopes are mainly 0 to 1 percent, but range to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1371 millimeters (54 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 17 degrees C (63 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: Clayey alluvium of the Mississippi River flood plain and its tributaries.
Landscape: Meander belts
Landform(s): These soils are in broad backswamps, depressions, swales of meander scrolls, sloughs, and flood plains on rises, talfs, and dips.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
Dowling soils are very poorly drained, are on similar positions and depressions, and are ponded except during prolonged dry periods and do not dry out.
Dundee soils are somewhat poorly drained, are located on natural levees and low terraces and formed in loamy alluvium that contain less than 35 percent clay.
Earle soils are poorly drained, are located slightly higher in the floodplain, and have a clayey over loamy particle size control section.
Fausse soils are very poorly drained, are ponded except during prolonged dry periods and do not dry out.
Forestdale soils are poorly drained, located on old, low natural levees and terraces, and have 35 to 60 percent clay in the particle size control section.
Tensas soils are somehwat poorly drained, located on old natural levees and have less than 60 percent clay in the particle size control section.
Tunica soils are poorly drained, located slightly higher in the floodplain, and have a clayey over loamy particle size control section.
Sharkey soils are poorly and very poorly drained, found in similar positions, but have a higher pH in the subsoil.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class: Poorly drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat): Cracks ranging from 2.5 to 5 centimeters (1 to 2.5 inches) wide and extending to as much as 0.6 to 0.9 meters (2 to 3 feet) in depth, form in these soils during the summer and early fall months in normal years. This allows for very rapid infiltration of water; and as the clay is wetted, it swells, forcing the cracks to close.  The upper 20 centimeters (0 to 8 inches) ranges from low to moderately high: 0.01 to 4.00 um/sec (0.0 to 0.6 in/hr).  The subsoil within the particle size control section ranges from very low to low: 0.01 to 0.42 um/sec (0.0 to 0.06 in/hr).  
Permeability: Very slow
Surface runoff: Very high on slopes of 1 percent or more; high on areas with slope less than 1 percent; negligible in depressional areas. 
Depth to seasonal high water table: The soil is saturated in the surface layer and along cracks and slickenside faces in the subsoil from December through July during normal years. 
Flooding frequency and duration:  Rare to frequent flooding; brief to long in low-lying areas and along tributaries. Areas along the lower courses of tributary streams to the Mississippi River are subject to backwater flooding. 
Ponding frequency and duration: It is ponded in depressional areas for brief to very long duration. 

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Major uses: Most areas of Alligator soils are used for growing soybeans, rice, cotton, and wheat. Many areas have been precision landformed to a consistent, uniform grade for furrow irrigation.  Native vegetation is bottomland hardwood dominated by baldcypress, ash, tupelo gum, swamp maple, oaks, hickories, and sweetgum. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Major Land Resource Areas (MLRA): Southern Mississippi River Alluvium (131A).
Extent:  Large

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Quitman County, Mississippi; 1950. 

REMARKS: This series is reclassified from very-fine, montmorillonitic, acid, thermic Vertic Haplaquepts as the result of a special study in April 1986 by NCSS representatives from Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana, the National Soil Survey Laboratory, and South National Technical Center. The classification was changed from Alfic to Chromic based on changes to the Keys to Taxonomy, 8th Edition, 1998. The present type location pedon actually classifies in an Aeric subgroup by 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) {2.5Y 5/2 matrix at 74 centimeters (29 inches) deep}, however additional study is needed to determine whether this is typical for Alligator soils. 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches) (Ap1, Ap2). 
Cambic horizon - the zone from 18 to 165 centimeters (7 to 65 inches) (Bg, Bssg1, Bssg2, and Bssycg). 
Aquic conditions - episaturation in the zone from 0 to 74 centimeters (0 to 29 inches) (Ap1, Ap2, Bg, and Bssg1 horizons). 
Slickensides- the zone from 48 to 165 centimeters (19 to 65 inches) (intersecting). 

All phases of the Alligator series are listed as hydric soils in the "Hydric Soils of the United States" (SCS Misc. Pub. No. 1491). 

Drained phases (0-5 percent slopes) of the Alligator series that are protected from flooding and are not frequently flooded during the growing season are considered prime farmland.

Soil classified according to the 12th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.
