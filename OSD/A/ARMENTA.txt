ARMENTA SERIES

The Armenta series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from pumice.  Armenta soils are on interfluves on undulating plateaus.  Slopes are 3 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-pumiceous, glassy, mesic Vitritorrandic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Armenta very paragravelly ashy coarse sand--on a footslope of an interfluve sloping 8 percent to the southeast at 6,275 feet elevation--pinyon-juniper forestland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on September 20, 2000, the soil was dry throughout.) Surface is covered with 55 percent pumice paragravel.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Armenta soils are on backslopes, footslopes, and toeslopes of interfluves on undulating plateaus. They formed in slope alluvium derived from air-fall pumice of the Quaternary Age Cajete Member. Slopes are 3 to 20 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,400 to 7,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Canuela, Hackroy, and Chiminet soils.  Canuela soils are loamy, shallow to bedrock, have an argillic horizon, and occur on beveled summits of interfluves.  Hackroy soils are clayey, shallow to bedrock, have an argillic horizon, and are on summits of interfluves.  Chiminet soils are loamy, very shallow to bedrock, and are on shoulders and backslopes of interfluves.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; low surface runoff; moderately rapid permeability in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part.

USE AND VEGETATION: Armenta soils are used for and recreation and wildlife habitat.  The historic climax vegetation is ponderosa pine, Gambel's oak, mountain muhly, and muttongrass.  The ecological site is Pinus edulis/Rhus trilobata/Bouteloua gracilis (F036XB133NM). 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Armenta soils are of small extent on the southwestern Espanola Basin part of the Basin and Range province in northcentral New Mexico. The MLRA is 36.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Santa Fe County, New Mexico, Santa Fe Area Soil Survey Update, 2008. Series proposed in Sandoval County, New Mexico; Bandelier National Monument Soil Survey; 2000. Armenta is a street name in Santa Fe. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 10 inches. (A and Bw horizons)

Vitritorrandic feature - Based on both the content of pumice and on the estimated content of volcanic glass throughout the upper 30 inches (A, Bw, Bk, and part of E and Bt horizons).

Taxonomic version: Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Calcium carbonate equivalence was determined using a calcimeter.
