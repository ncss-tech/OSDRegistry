COMPETING SERIES: 
There are no series in the same family.
Similar soils are the Baffin, Coards, and Sellman series.

Sellman soils--have glauconitic mineralogy; mesic soil temperature regime; have thick layers with n value greater than 0.7

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--estuarine deposits 
Landscape--Coastal estuaries and lagoons
Landform--Mainland coves and subtidal mud flats
Slope--less than 1 percent

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
These are the Harris, Tatlum, Tracosa, and the tentative Jonesbay series. 
Harris, Tatlum, and Tracosa soils--are slightly higher on the landscape and don't have continuous inundation 
Jonesbay soils--have thick horizons with n values greater than 0.7 on similar landforms

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class--Subaqueous 
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity--very low
Soil Moisture Regime--Peraquic
Soil is continuously inundated by saline water. The presence of hypersulfidic materials within 50 centimeters of the soil surface puts these soils at risk for potential acid sulfate soil formation if they are dredged and exposed to the atmosphere.

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Major uses--These areas are used as wildlife habitat and for recreational activities. 
Native vegetation--Some areas have smooth cordgrass but most areas have bare mud bottoms.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
General area--These soils are located on the upper Texas Gulf Coast  
Land Resource Region--T- Atlantic and Gulf Coast Lowland Forest and Crop Region 
MLRA--150B - Gulf Coast Saline Prairies 
Extent--Small
