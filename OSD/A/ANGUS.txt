ANGUS SERIES

The Angus series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy calcareous till. These soils are on slightly convex slopes on backslopes, shoulders, and summits on ground moraines and till plains.  Slopes range from 2 to 9 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 610 to 930 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: ST. PAUL, MINNESOTA

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Meeker County, Minnesota, 1995. 

REMARKS: 
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 20 to 70 centimeters (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons);
Series control section--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 150 centimeters.
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 20 centimeters;
argillic horizon--the zone from 20 to 89 centimeters;
endosaturation--100 to 200 centimeters
redoximorphic concentrations--102 to 200 centimeters
redoximorphic depletions--102 to 200 centimeters

This soil was previously included in the Lester series. However, after investigation, it was concluded that Lester soils on a slope of 2 to 5 percent have seasonal zone of saturation between 100 to 180 centimeters rather than greater than 200 centimeters.
