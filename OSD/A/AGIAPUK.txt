COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this classification.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: silty eolian deposits over gravelly alluvium
Landforms: fan terraces on alluvial fans
Slope: 2 to 5 percent
Mean annual temperature: 23.0 to 25 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 22 to 28 inches
Elevation: 380 to 564 feet
Frost-free period: 60 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Boldrin, Nuluk, and Pinguk soils. Boldrin soils are very poorly drained, shallow or moderately deep to permafrost, and occur on mountain footslopes and toeslopes. Nuluk soils are somewhat poorly drained, very deep, and occur on floodplains. Pinguk soils are somewhat poorly drained, very deep, and occur on alluvial fans.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, low runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the solum and high to very high in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for military uses and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is ericaceous shrub/lichen dwarf shrub.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 240, Nulato Hills-Southern Seward Peninsula Highlands Alaska. The series is of small extent.
