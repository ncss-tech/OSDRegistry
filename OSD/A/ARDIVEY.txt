ARDIVEY SERIES

The Ardivey series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Ardivey soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Durinodic Haplargids

    2Btqk--25 to 43 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; few thin clay films coating and bridging sand grains; 50 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; common fine lime and silica coating on most gravel and cobbles; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 33 cm thick)

    3Bqk--43 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) extremely gravelly loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and few fine roots; 60 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles, and 2 percent stones; 20 percent discontinuous strong lime and silica cemented layers with 35 percent durinodes; plates and pendants; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  Nye County, Nevada; about 0.7 mile west of State Route 8A and .5 mile north of Park Canyon Road; approximately 2,100 feet north and 1,585 feet west of the southeast corner of section 13, T. 13 N., R. 42 E.; USGS Carvers NW 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 59 minutes 16 seconds N and longitude 117 degrees 12 minutes 15 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.9878889 latitude, -117.204444 longitude.

Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 15 degrees C.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 18 to 35 percent.
Rock fragments: 35 to 60 percent, mainly gravel.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Redflame series.  Redflame soils have a mean annual temperature of 6 to 10 degrees F. and does not receive summer precipitation.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ardivey soils are on fan remnants.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium dominantly from volcanic rocks, tuff, shale and granitic rocks.  Elevations are 1,178 to 2,091 meters.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 11 to 14 degrees C and the frost-free season is 120 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Izo, Spanel, and Wardenot soils.  Izo and Wardenot soils lack argillic horizon and are sandy-skeletal.  Spanel soils are loamy and have a duripans.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Ardivey soils are used for livestock grazing.  The vegetation is principally Bailey's greasewood, shadscale, bud sagebrush, galleta, Indian ricegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Nevada.  These soils are extensive with about 102,000 acres of the series mapped to date.  The series concept and main acreage is in MLRA 29, while other acreage occurs in MLRA 27.
