REMARKS:
Particle size control section--the zone from a depth of 86 to 136 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 180 centimeters

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 86 centimeters (A, Bw, and E/B horizons);
albic horizon--the zone from a depth of 56 to 86 centimeters (E/B horizon);
glossic horizon--the zone from a depth of 56 to 104 centimeters (E/B and B/E horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 86 to 180 centimeters (B/E, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons);
densic contact--contact with dense till at a depth of 180 centimeters (Cd horizon);
udic moisture regime. 1/19/2011-TYPE LOCATION error was corrected.

Higher bulk density of the argillic horizon is considered to be relict of the till
