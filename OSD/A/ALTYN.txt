ALTYN SERIES 

The Altyn series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in volcanic ash influenced alluvium, colluvium or till derived from metasedimentary sources. These soils are on alluvial fans, colluvial aprons and mountain slopes. Slopes are 4 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1,025 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 4.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed Vitrandic Haplocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Altyn gravelly ashy loam, in coniferous forest at 1,370 meters elevation (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 12 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly ashy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine, and common medium and coarse roots; many very fine irregular pores; 30 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary.

    Bw1--12 to 25 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly ashy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine, and common medium and coarse roots; common very fine irregular pores; 25 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary.

    2Bw2--25 to 41 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine and medium, and few coarse roots; common very fine irregular pores; 35 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary.

    2C1--41 to 62 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) extremely gravelly loamy sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium and coarse roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 70 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary.

    2C2--62 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) extremely gravelly coarse sand moist; brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 70 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2).
