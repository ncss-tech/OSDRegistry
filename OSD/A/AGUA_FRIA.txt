COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Panky series.  Panky soils do not have horizons with gravelly textures above 40 inches and do not have horizons with very gravelly textures between 40 and 60 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Agua Fria soils are on summits of erosional fan remnants.  They formed in alluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist; and Quaternary loess.  Slopes are 1 to 4 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,600 to 6,700 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.   The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Golondrina and Paraje soils and the competing Panky soil.  Golondrina soils are loamy-skeletal, have mollic epipedons, and occur on backslopes and footslopes of erosional fan remnants.  Paraje soils are loamy-skeletal and occur on adjacent beveled summits and shoulders of erosional fan remnants.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium surface runoff; permeability is slow in the upper part and moderately rapid to very rapid in the lower part.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Agua Fria soils are used for urban development, livestock grazing, and recreation.  The historic climax vegetation is blue grama, galleta, ring muhly, oneseed juniper, sand dropseed, and threeawn.  The ecological site is Cinder(R036XB117NM).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Agua Fria soils are of small extent on the southeastern Espanola Basin part of the Basin and Range province in northcentral New Mexico.  The MLRA is 36.

Ochric epipedon: The zone from the soil surface to 3 inches. (AE horizon)
Argillic horizon: The zone from 3 to 19 inches. (Bt, Btk1, and Btk2 horizons)
Calcic horizon: The zone from 19 to 53 inches. (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)

The 11/2006 revision moves the typical pedon to the pedon used in the update survey of the Santa Fe Area. The classification was also revised from fine, montmorillonitic, mesic Ustollic Haplargids to fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Calcic Paleargids. The series range in characteristics was re-written to comprise only the Agu Fria soils in the Santa Fe update survey.

Taxonomic version: Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.
