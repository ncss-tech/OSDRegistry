ARMSTER SERIES

The Armster series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in 18 to 50 centimeters of loess or loess and pedisediment and in the underlying reddish-colored late Sangamon paleosol weathered from till. These soils are on side slopes and ridges on till plains. Slope ranges from 2 to 25 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Mollic Hapludalfs
