CINNADALE SERIES

The Cinnadale series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived mainly from sandstone and siltstone. These soils are on cuestas, hogbacks, ridges and hills. Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Cinnadale gravelly very fine sandy loam--forested. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 1 inch; partially decomposed pine needles.

    A--1 to 5 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) gravelly very fine sandy loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; 20 percent pebbles; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (3 to 7 inches thick)

    Bw--5 to 13 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) very channery loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; 20 percent pebbles and 30 percent channers; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (7 to 13 inches thick)

    2R--13 inches; sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION: Cibola County, New Mexico; Page Quadrangle; about 3 miles southeast of Page; 1,500 feet west and 1,800 feet south of the northeast corner of sec. 10, T. 12 N., R. 15 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Hue: 2.5YR or 5YR
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4 dry or moist
Textures: loam or silt loam
Rock fragments: 35 to 55 percent total (All rock fragments are sandstone)

                           0 to 5 percent flagstones

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cypher (NM), Devilfence (MT), Deville (MT), Kounter (MT), Quaint (MT), Roegulch (MT), Shaboom (MT), Sharrott (MT), Valto (CO) and Villareal (CO) series. Cypher, Deville, Roegulch, Shaboom, and Sharrott soils have hues yellower than 7.5YR. Devilfence, Kounter, and Quaint soils have accumulations of calcium carbonate in the profile. Valto soils have less than 50 percent silt in the Bw horizon and are still moist from snowmelt until mid June. Villareal soils formed in slope alluvium derived from andesite are still moist from snowmelt until mid June. In addition, Devilfence, Deville, Kounter, Quaint, Roegulch, Shaboom, and Sharrott soils are in LRR-G and are more moist in May and June.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cinnadale soils formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived mainly from siltstone and sandstone and are on cuestas, hogbacks, ridges and hills. Slopes are 1 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 7,200 to 8,400 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 24 inches and the mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Moreno, Stout and Yankee series. Moreno and Yankee soils are deep. Stout soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Main use is woodland. Present native vegetation includes ponderosa pine, mountain muhly, prairie junegrass, Arizona fescue, and Gambel oak.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Zuni mountain area of northwestern New Mexico. MLRA 39, LRR-D. The series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Cibola County, New Mexico; 1986.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 4 inches. (A horizon)

Cambic horizon - The zone from about 4 to 12 inches. (Bw horizon)

Lithic contact - At 12 inches. (R horizon) In some pedons the upper few inches of the Lithic contact is weathered.
