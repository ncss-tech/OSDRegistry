CHURIPA SERIES

The Churipa series consists of well drained soils that are shallow to duripan. Churipa soils formed in alluvium material derived from basalt, volcanic ash, and cinders. They are on beveled summits and shoulders of mesas. Slopes are 5 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are currently no competitors.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Churipa soils are on beveled summits and shoulders of mesas.  They formed in alluvium derived from basalt, volcanic ash, and cinders. Slopes are 5 to 15 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,700 to 6,700 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Calabasas, Medrano, Tetilla, and Tsinat soils. Calabasas soils are deep to petrocalcic horizons, are fine-silty, and occur on summits of undulating plateaus. Medrano soils are shallow to duripans, are loamy-skeletal, and occur on cinder cones. Tetilla soils have calcic horizons below 40 inches, do not have cemented pans, and occur on toeslopes of undulating plateaus. Tsinat soils are moderately deep to petrocalcic horizons, have calcic horizons, and occur on summits of undulating plateaus.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low surface runoff; moderately slow permeability in the subsoil, moderately rapid permeability in the substratum, and very slow permeability in the duripan/petrocalcic horizon.

USE AND VEGETATION: Churipa soils are used for urban development, livestock grazing, and recreation. The historic climax vegetation is blue grama, skunkbush sumach, galleta, sideoats gama, little bluestem, and oneseed juniper.  The ecological site is Shallow(R036XB116NM).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Churipa soils are of small extent on the southcentral Espanola Basin part of the Basin and Range province in northcentral New Mexico. The MLRA is 36.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Santa Fe County, New Mexico; Santa Fe Area Soil Survey Update; 2008. Churipa is a local place name. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of 1 inch. (A horizon)
Argillic horizon - The zone from 1 to 13 inches. (Bt1, Bt2, and Btk horizons)
Duripan and petrocalcic horizon - The zone from 17 to 30 inches. (Bkqm horizon)
Lithic contact - indurated basalt bedrock at 35 inches (2R layer)
Particle-size control section: the zone from 1 to 13 inches (entire argillic horizon)

Note: This soil has minor amounts of volcanic glass in either the very fine sand or fine sand fractions within 50 cm of the soil surface. It is assumed that most of the volcanic glass derived from nearby Pleistocene ash eruptions has altered to more stable minerals like chalcedony. In addition, Lincoln lab data on similar soils indicates that ammonium oxalate extractable aluminum and iron percentages are very low. Typical totals of aluminum plus 1/2 iron percentages are less than 0.20. Churipa soils thus do not have the properties of the andic intergrades.

Taxonomic version: Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.

ADDITIONAL DATA: The series type location has been sampled for the National Soil Survey Laboratory (NSSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S99NM-049-16. Reference analyses to determine if this soil has a duripan, petrocalcic horizon, or both are being performed.
