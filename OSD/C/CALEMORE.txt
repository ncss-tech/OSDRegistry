CALEMORE SERIES

The Calemore series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess derived primarily from sedimentary deposits. Calemore soils are on plains and fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Calemore silt loam, on a west facing, nearly level, 2 percent slope at an elevation of 5,890 feet. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on March 9, 1989 the soil was moist from 0 to 11 inches.

    A--0 to 7 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 9 inches thick)

    Bt1--7 to 11 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) silty clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few patchy distinct clay films on vertical and horizontal faces of peds; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.

    Bt2--11 to 20 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine and medium subangular blocks; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common continuous distinct clay films on vertical and horizontal faces of peds; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the Bt horizons are 11 to 15 inches)

    Btk1--20 to 36 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam, dark yellowish brown(10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocks; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine roots; common continuous distinct clay films on vertical and horizontal faces of peds; common fine soft masses of lime; violently effervescent; 8 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.

    Btk2--36 to 42 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silty clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4)moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few patchy distinct clay films on vertical faces of peds; common medium rounded soft masses of lime; 7 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of Btk horizons are 13 to 27 inches)

    Bk--42 to 65 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; violently effervescent; 25 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).
