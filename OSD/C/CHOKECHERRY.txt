CHOKECHERRY SERIES

The Chokecherry series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and residuum derived from red sandstone, red siltstone, yellow sandstone or siltstone, gray siltstone or loess influenced quartzite or rhyolite. Chokecherry soils are on mountain slopes, hillslopes, and ridges. Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3.3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Lithic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Chokecherry very gravelly sandy loam, on a northwest-facing, 18 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 2222 meters. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 A1--0 to 10 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) very cobbly sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, non-sticky and non-plastic; many very fine and fine and common medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 25 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 15 cm thick)

 A2--10 to 23 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) very cobbly sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; soft, very friable, non-sticky and non-plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium and coarse roots; many fine irregular pores; 15 percent gravel and 35 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 20 cm thick)

 Bw--23 to 46 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) extremely cobbly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, non-sticky and non-plastic; few very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; many fine irregular pores; 25 percent gravel and 35 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 23 cm thick)

 R--46 cm; sandstone bedrock.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Clavicon, Monida and Tubbs Hollow series. Clavicon and Tubbs Hollow soils are moderately deep and occur on similar positions. Monida soils are very deep and are in lower positions on hillslopes

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; very low to medium surface runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Chokecherry soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly mountain big sage, low sage, bluebunch wheatgrass, antelope bitterbrush, serviceberry, snowberry, rabbitbrush, lupine, and few mountain mahogany.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Chokecherry soils are of small extent in southeastern and south-central Idaho; MLRA 43B and 13.
