CEDARPOINT SERIES

The Cedarpoint series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from mixed quartzite and limestone.  Cedarpoint soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 20 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Argixerolls
