CLARK SERIES


The Clark series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium. Clark soils are on paleoterraces on river valleys in the Great Bend Sand Plains, MLRA 79. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters (30 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (56 degrees F).

Mean annual air temperature: 13 to 14 degrees C (55 to 58 degrees F).
Mean annual precipitation: 660 to 760 millimeters (26 to 30 inches)
Precipitation pattern: Precipitation is usually evenly distributed throughout the year with the exception of November through February being the driest months and May and June being the wettest months.  Summer precipitation occurs during intense summer thunderstorms.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kanza, Ninnescah, Ost, and Shellabarger soils.
The Kanza and Ninnescah soils are on floodplains, have sandier textures, and are poorly or somewhat poorly drained. The Ost soils are on similar landform positions, have an argillic horizon, and are deeper to a calcic horizon. The Shellabarger soils are on similar landform positions, have an argillic horizon, but do not have a calcic horizon. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage: well drained
Runoff: low to medium 
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: moderately high 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. 
Principal crops are wheat, sorghum, and alfalfa. 
Native vegetation is tall prairie grasses. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South Central Kansas; Land Resource Region H, Central Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range Region; MLRA 79, Great Bend Sand Plains. The series is of large extent.

12/2012 DJK - Edited climate data in intro and geographic setting. Added clay, sand, and rock fragments to horizons in RIC. Updated geographically associated soils (deleted Avans, Bethany, Blanket, Case, Farnum, Naron, and Penalosa and added Kanza, Ninniscah, and Shellabarger). Edited runoff to actual classes. Added cambic horizon to remarks.  Removed central Oklahoma from Distribution and Extent.
