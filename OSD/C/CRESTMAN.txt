CRESTMAN SERIES

The Crestman series consist of shallow, well to excessively drained soils that formed in materials weathered in place from calcareous sandstone.  Crestman soils are on rolling to hilly uplands and plateaus.  Slopes are 3 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Mixed, frigid, shallow Ustic Torripsamments

TYPICAL PEDON:  Crestman loamy fine sand, rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A1--0 to 3 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grained; slightly hard, loose; many fine, medium, and coarse roots; calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 5 inches thick)

     AC--3 to 7 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grained; soft, loose; many fine, medium, and coarse roots to 7 inches; calcareous; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 5 inches thick)

     C1--7 to 16 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grained; loose; few medium and coarse roots to 11 inches, very few coarse roots to 16 inches; calcareous; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual smooth boundary.  (7 to 15 inches thick)

     C2r--16 to 20 inches; soft, calcareous, fine grained sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION:  Carbon County, Wyoming; about 16 miles south of Creston Junction; center of Sec. 29, T. 19 N., R. 92 W. High Point USGS quad; approximate lat. 41 degrees 35 minutes 36 seconds N. and long. 107 degrees 47 minutes 10 seconds W., NAD 83

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually calcareous throughout, but the surface 3 or 4 inches may be noncalcareous. Depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 46F.  The control section is fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.  Sandstone rock fragments 1/2 to 1 inch in diameter range from 0 to 30 percent.

The A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR; value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through  6 moist; and chroma of 2 through 4.  This horizon is slightly alkaline through strongly alkaline.

The C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR; value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  Textures include fine sand and gravelly loamy sand.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Fleak series.  Fleak soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section three-fourths or more of time (cumulative).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Crestman soils are on rolling to hilly uplands. Slopes are 3 to 50 percent.  The soils formed in materials weathered in place from calcareous sandstone.  Elevation is 6,000 to 7,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches and occurs mainly in the winter and spring.  The mean annual air temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 75 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cothran and Spool soils.  Cothran soils lack bedrock above 40 inches. Spool soils have a lithic contact at depths of 3 to 10 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained to excessively drained; slow to medium runoff; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for range and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is needleleaf sedge, Indian ricegrass, needleandthread, prairie junegrass, and rabbitbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Wyoming and Northwestern Colorado.  The series is of limited extent.
