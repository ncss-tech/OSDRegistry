COYOTEBLUFF SERIES

The Coyotebluff series consists of deep, well-drained soils on mountain sideslopes. Coyotebluff soils formed in mixed volcanic ash and loess over granitic colluvium. Slopes are 30 to 90 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and mean annual temperature about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-skeletal over loamy-skeletal, glassy over isotic, frigid Humic Vitrixerands

TYPICAL PEDON: Coyotebluff very stony ashy sandy loam - forested, on a 63 percent northfacing slope at an elevation of 4,100 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted. Soil textures are apparent field textures.)
