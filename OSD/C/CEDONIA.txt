CEDONIA SERIES

The Cedonia series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous glaciolacustrine sediments mixed with loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. Cedonia soils are on lake terraces and terrace breaks and have slopes of 0 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 457 mm and the average annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Laketon series. 
Laketon soils: are dry 45 to 60 days in the soil moisture control section and do not have Bk horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cedonia soils are on outwash plains, relict glacial lake terraces and terrace breaks at elevations of 1,290 to 2,700 feet(394 to 823m). Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. They formed in calcareous glaciolacustrine sediments mixed with loess and volcanic ash mixed in the upper part. The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and cool moist winters. Average annual precipitation ranges from 15 11 to 25 inches (280 to 635mm). Average July temperature is about 68 degrees F., and average annual temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F. The frost-free period is 100 to 135 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brincken, Hodgson, Hunters, Lakesol, and Peone soils. Brincken soils are on terraces, have a mollic epipedon and have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section. Hunters soils have a mollic epipedon 25 to 50cm thick and are on terraces. Hodgson soils have more than 36 percent clay in an argillic horizon from 18 to 68cm and are on terraces. Lakesol soils are frigid, have a mollic epipedon 18 to 30cm thick, and are on terraces. Peone soils are in drainageways and have contemporary redoximorphic features within 50cm of the mineral soil surface.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained;-moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Cedonia soils are used for growing small grains, alfalfa, hay and timber. Native vegetation is ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine, some Douglas-fir, western larch, pinegrass, snowberry, mallow ninebark, and wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern Washington; MLRA 43A, 44A. The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Spokane County, Washington, 1964.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil are:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 30cm (Ap and AB horizons)
Cambic horizon - the zone from 30 to 83cm (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons) 
Secondary carbonates - the zone from 30 to 83cm (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)
Vitrandic feature - the zone from 0 to 30cm (Ap and AB horizons)
Particle-size control section - the zone from 25 to 100cm (part of AB, Bk1, Bk2 and part of C horizon)

The 10/2001 pedon description was updated based on revisiting the original type location.  The Bw horizons were revised to Bk horizons.  Additional investigation is needed as to the depth range to identifiable secondary carbonates although at this time presence is typically above 40 inches in Spokane, Stevens, North Ferry, and Colville Indian Reservation soil survey areas.

Classification revised as of 5/2000 from fine-silty, mixed, mesic Vitrandic Xerochrepts to fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Vitrandic Haploxerepts based on revisions to Soil Taxonomy.

Additional investigation is needed to this series concept in regards to the occurrence of a saturated zone above the substratum and the need for a revision of drainage class.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Partial laboratory data available for this series. Pedon number 85P894, sample number S85WA019-002, NSSL, Lincoln, NE 3/88.
