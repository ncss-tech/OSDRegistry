CHAMITA SERIES

The Chamita series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from shale, sandstone and metamorphic rock.  Chamita soils are on flood plains, valley floors and low stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 508 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Cumulic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Chamita loam - meadow.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 18 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; strong medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.

    A2--18 to 41 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; few medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) redox concentrations; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; many very fine, fine, and few medium roots; many fine interstitial pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.

    A3--41 to 64 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; few medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) redox concentrations; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; common very fine, fine, and few medium roots; common fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  

    A4--64 to 91 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; many medium and coarse distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) redox concentrations; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few very fine and medium roots; few fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (combined thickness of A1, A2, A3 and A4 horizons - 66 to 144 cm)

    Cg1--91 to 140 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; common coarse distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) redox concentrations; massive; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few very fine and medium roots; few fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (13 to 64 cm thick)

    Cg2--140 to 152 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; few fine faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) redox concentrations; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; 30 percent fine pebbles; neutral (pH 7.0).
