CHILDRESS SERIES

The Childress series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils.  These soils formed in loamy gypsiferous alluvial or lacustrine sediments of Quaternary age.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on stream terraces and dissected remnants of lakebeds of the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78B and 78C).  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this family.  Similar soils are the Cornick, Cottonwood, and Vinson soils.  These soils are underlain by bedrock gypsum at very shallow to moderate depths. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform: Stream terraces or dissected remnants of old lakebeds or other outwashes within or from the Blaine Formation.  Childress soils commonly occur as small rounded or oblong areas within areas of Acme soils.  
Parent material: sediments high in gypsum
Slope: 0 to 3 percent.
Mean annual temperature: 61 to about 66 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 20 to 25 inches 
Frost-free period: 205 to 230 days 
Elevation: 1600 to 1850 feet
Thornthwaite annual P-E indices: 32 to 37 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Abilene, Acme, Kingco and Rowena soils.  
Abilene, Kingco, and Rowena series: These soils occur slightly higher in the landscape.  These very deep soils have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick and a clayey particle-size class.
Acme Series: These very deep soils have a mollic epipedon and afine-silty particle-size class.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Moderate permeability. Runoff is negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes and low on 1 to 3 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is mainly used as rangeland.   Short grasses are prevalent where grazing is continuous, but some tall grasses grow in protected areas.  Where the soil is intermingled with deeper and more productive soils, small areas are cultivated.  Some areas are mined for the soft impure gypsum.  This material is used for making sheetrock wall board.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Rolling Red Plains of north central Texas; LRR H; MLRA 78B and 78C.  Small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas.

SERIES PROPOSED: Childress County, Texas; 2003

REMARKS:  This soil was formerly included with the Cottonwood series.  Cottonwood soils formed in residuum over crystalline or alabaster gypsum.  The Childress soil has concentrations of gypsum throughout the By horizons believed to be formed by upwards capillary action of water high in dissolved gypsum from a previous or present fluctuating water table from lower strata.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 5 inches
Gypsic horizon: 5 to 80 inches
Particle-size-control section: 10 to 40 inches

Range Site: Gyp - 078BY076TX
