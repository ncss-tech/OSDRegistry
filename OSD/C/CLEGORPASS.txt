CLEGORPASS SERIES

The Clegorpass series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. Clegorpass soils are on fan remnant summits and have slopes of 2 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 72 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, hyperthermic Typic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Carrizo-Clegorpass associaton, 2 to 8 percent slopes at an elevation of 1,110 feet. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The surface is covered by approximately 95 percent gravel,  trace of cobbles and trace of stones.

    Ay--0 to 4 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; strong very coarse platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common very fine and few fine vesicular pores and common very fine and few fine interstitial; 1 percent fine rounded masses of gypsum on surfaces of coarse fragments; 20 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 9 inches thick).

    Bty--4 to 18 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine tubular pores and common very fine and few fine interstitial; 50 percent discontinuous prominent clay skins on faces of peds and sand grains; less than 1 percent fine rounded masses of gypsum on surfaces of coarse fragments; 45 percent gravel and 1 percent cobbles;  noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.3); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 28 inches thick).

    Btkq1--18 to 38 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly coarse sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and common fine interstitial pores; 20 percent discontinuous prominent clay skins on sand and gravel; 4 percent pockets and discontinuous bands of disseminated lime 2 to 4 inches thick, violently effervescent; thin (1 to 3 millimeters) lime and silica coats on underside of coarse fragments; 5 percent moderately and 10 percent very weakly cemented discontinuous bands of silica and lime; 40 percent gravel and 2 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6), clear wavy boundary.

    Btkq2--38 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and common fine interstitial pores; 10 percent discontinuous prominent clay skins on sand and gravel; 2 percent pockets and discontinuous bands of disseminated lime 2 to 4 inches thick, violently effervescent; thin (1 to 3 millimeters) lime and silica coats on underside of coarse fragments; 5 percent moderately and 10 percent very weakly cemented discontinuous bands of silica and lime; 50 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).

Chroma: 3 or 4.

Clay content: 6 to 12 percent.

Calcium carbonate equivalence: 1 to 5 percent.

Reaction: Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.

Sodium adsorption ratio: 0 to 2

Gypsum: 0 to 2 percent.

Bty horizon - Value: 4, 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist.

Chroma: 4 or 6 dry.

Texture of the fine earth: Coarse sandy loam, sandy loam or loam.

Structure: Weak or moderate, fine to coarse.

Consistence: Moderately hard to very hard, very friable or friable.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Clegorpass soils are on fan remnant summits. Slopes are 2 to 4 percent. These soils formed in mixed alluvium. Elevations are 715 to 2,560 feet. The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 2 to 6 inches; mean annual air temperature is 68 to 74 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 300 to 360 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Carrizo soils. Carrizo soils are on alluvial fans, inset fans and drainage ways and have sandy-skeletal textural control sections and lack argillic horizons. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low runoff; moderate over rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Clegorpass soils are used for military exercises and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly creosotebush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave desert of southeastern California, U.S.A.; MLRA 30. These soils are of small extent.
