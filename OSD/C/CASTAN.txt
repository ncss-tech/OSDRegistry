COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Castan soils are on escarpments of volcanic plateaus. Slopes are 30 to 50 percent and are dominantly concave in shape. This soil formed in local alluvium, colluvium or residuum from tephra and loess. The rock fragments and sand size fraction are dominantly obsidian. Elevations range from 6,500 to 8,000 feet. The average annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 60 inches. Average annual air temperature is 30 to 37 degrees F. Frost may occur at anytime throughout the year.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the proposed Dashiki, Lasac and Oleo series. Dashiki and Oleo soils occur on adjacent volcanic plateaus. Dashiki soils have an ochric epipedon and are moderately deep over substratum layers of tephra. Oleo soils have an argillic horizon and average less than 35 percent rock fragments throughout the solum. Lasac soils occur intermixed with the Castan soils on convex slope positions. They are less than 20 inches to substratum layers of tephra.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to moderate runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Castan soils are used for recreation, woodland and wildlife habitat. These soils commonly support a lodgepole pine/grouse whortleberry plant community type. The potential native vegetation is a whitebark pine/grouse whortleberry plant association. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Idaho and northwestern Wyoming. The soil is of small extent.
