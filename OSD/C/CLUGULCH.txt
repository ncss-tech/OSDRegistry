CLUGULCH SERIES 

The Clugulch series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from granite or other coarse grained igneous rocks.   These soils are on bedrock-floored plains, mountains, and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive Lithic Haplocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Clugulch sandy loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 inches to 2; partially decomposed twigs, needles, bark, and lichens. (1 to 3 inches thick) 

    A--2 to 5 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.7); clear wavy boundary. (1 to 4 inches thick) 

    Bw--5 to 9 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) coarse sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine angular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; few very fine pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); abrupt wavy boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick) 

    R--9 inches; hard granite bedrock. 

TYPE LOCATION:  Silver Bow County, Montana; 2,000 feet south and 1,350 feet west of the NE corner of sec. 5, T. 1 S., R. 6 W. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil temperature - 38 to 42 degrees F. 
Moisture control section - 4 inches to the lithic contact. 
Depth to bedrock - less than 10 inches. 
Surface stones or boulders - 0 to 0.1 percent
The surface, when mixed to a depth of 7 inches, does not meet the color requirements for a mollic epipedon. 
Some pedons have a Cr horizon above the R horizon.

A horizon 
Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y 
Value:  4 or 5 dry 
Chroma:  1, 2, or 3 
Texture:  sandy loam or coarse sandy loam 
Clay content:  10 to 18 percent 
Rock fragments:  0 to 25 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent cobbles 
Reaction:  pH 6.1 to 7.5 

Bw horizon 
Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y 
Value:  5 or 6 dry; 4 or 5 moist 
Chroma:  2 or 3 
Texture:  sandy loam or coarse sandy loam, more than 35 percent fine and coarser sand 
Clay content:  5 to 15 percent 
Rock fragments:  5 to 35 percent gravel (mainly less than 10 mm in diameter)
Reaction:  pH 6.1 to 7.5 

C horizon present in some pedons.

COMPETING SERIES: 

Clinetop (CO) - has more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section; is medium to slightly acid throughout; has precipitation range of 28 to 35 inches. 

Goodview (AK) - have an umbric epipedon.

Liesnoi (AK) - has a silt loam loess mantle over bedrock; has a udic or wetter moisture regime. 

Noname (OR) - has more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section; does not have an O horizon.

Olathe (CO) - has less than 35 percent fine and coarser sand in the particle-size control section; has 24 to 28 inches of precipitation; is at elevations of 9,000 feet and higher. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 

Landform - bedrock-floored plains; mountains; hills. 
Elevation - 5,500 to 7,000 feet. 
Slope - 2 to 70 percent. 
Parent material - residuum derived from granite or other coarse grained igneous rocks. 
Climate - long, cold winters; cool, moist springs; short, cool summers. 
Mean annual precipitation - 15 to 24 inches. 
Mean annual air temperature - 36 to 40 degrees. 
Frost free season - 50 to 70 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Clugulch soils are primarily used for timber production, understory grazing, watersheds, and as wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is Douglas fir, lodgepole pine, and common juniper with a sparse understory of heartleaf arnica, Idaho fescue, spirea, and woods rose. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Clugulch soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Silver Bow County portion of the Jefferson Soil Survey area, Montana, 1998. 

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1596, MT3075.  
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  
A layer of partially decomposed forest litter from 2 inches to the mineral soil surface (Oi horizon); 
Ochric epipedon - from the soil surface to 7 inches (A, Bw horizons); 
Cambic horizon - from 3 to 7 inches (Bw horizon); 
Lithic contact - hard granite bedrock at 7 inches (R horizon); 
Particle-size control section from 0 to 7 inches (A, Bw horizons).  

Clugulch soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime. 

The 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Loamy, mixed, superactive Lithic Eutrocryepts to Loamy, mixed, superactive Lithic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups.
