CHAPARRAL SERIES

The Chaparral series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in gravelly alluvium. These gently sloping soils are on alluvial fans and erosional remnants of fan piedmonts. Slope ranges from 2 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are Ima (NM), Mallet (AZ), and Perilla (AZ) series. 
Ima soils are typically 5YR and receive greater than 12 inches of precipitation, and contain less than 15 percent rock fragments. Mallet soils receive greater than 13 percent of the total precipitation during the months of January, February, and March.  They also include fine sandy loam and loam in the Bw horizon. The Mallet soil also contains 1 to 2 percent organic matter. 
Perilla soils receive greater than 13 percent of the total precipitation during the months of January, February, and March. They also include hue of 5YR and have free carbonates within 15 inches of the surface. The Perilla soils also contain carbonates at 20 to 30 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material:  alluvium
Landform: alluvial fans and erosion remnants on fan piedmonts
Slope:  2 to 5 percent
Mean annual temperature: 60 to 64 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 10 to 12 inches
Precipitation pattern:  precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September.  The driest months are March and April.  Precipitation during the months of January, February, and March is less than 13 percent of the total.
Frost-free period: 170 to 210 days

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (Bw1, Bw2, Bw3, and C1 horizons)

Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 7 inches. (A horizon)

Cambic horizon:  The zone from 7 to 36 inches. (Bw1, Bw2, and Bw3 horizons)

Ustic feature:  The soil has an aridic moisture regime that borders on the ustic regime.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
