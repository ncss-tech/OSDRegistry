CEDARPINES SERIES

The Cedarpines series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from granitoid sources, usually quartz monzonite. Cedarpines soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes range from 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 900 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haploxerepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cedarpines cobbly sandy loam, on a west-southwest-facing, linear, 45 percent slope under incense cedar, California black oak, bigberry manzanita, Coulter pine and shrubs at an elevation of 1,585 meters. The soil surface is covered with 2 to 5 centimeters of leaf litter.  

  A -- 0 to 12 centimeters; 50 percent light gray (10YR 7/1) and 50 percent gray (10YR 6/1) cobbly sandy loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable; 5 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 15 centimeters thick)

  Bw1 -- 12 to 21 centimeters; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) cobbly sandy loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; 5 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear irregular boundary.

  Bw2 -- 21 to 50 centimeters; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) sandy loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; 5 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear irregular boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bw horizon is 23 to 80 centimeters)

  C -- 50 to 60 centimeters; dark grayish olive (10Y 4/2) extremely cobbly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable; common fine and medium roots throughout; 25 percent gravel and 40 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 12 centimeters thick)

  Cr -- 60 centimeters; moderately cemented quartz monzonite.
