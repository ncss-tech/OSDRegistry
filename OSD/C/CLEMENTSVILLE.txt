CLEMENTSVILLE SERIES

The Clementsville series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum weatherd from rhyolite a with loess influence.  Clementsville soils are on mountain slopes and have slopes of 4 to 12 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3.3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Calcic Pachic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Clementsville silt loam, cultivated, on a 9 percent mountain slope at an elevation of 2,032 meters. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

 Bw2--34 to 50 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 30 percent medium gravel and 25 percent fine gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bw horizons is 33 to 59 cm)

 Bk--50 to 62 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; calcium carbonate coats and silica coats on all surfaces of rock fragments; root mat on top of channers including many very fine and fine roots; 45 percent gravel, 15 percent channers and 10 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent (26 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 24 cm thick)

 Bkq--62 to 88 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) extremely cobbly loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; loose, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; discontinuous laminar cap at 70 cm; calcium carbonate coats and silica coats on all surfaces of rock fragments; root mat on top of flagstones including many very fine and fine roots; 40 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles and 10 percent flagstones; violently effervescent (38 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary.

 R--88 cm; rhyolite.
