COMPETING SERIES:  The only known competing series is the Tavernier soil. 
Tavernier soils--are subject to daily flooding by marine water, are dominated by mangroves, and occur in the tidal zone.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landscape: Florida Everglades
Landform: Talfs, rises, and/or dips in fresh water marshes and swamps.  Parent Material: organic materials formed from remains of hydrophytic herbaceous plant overlying limestone bedrock. 
Mean Annual Air Temperature--24 to 26 degrees C (75 to 79 degrees F)
Mean Annual Precipitation--1118 to 1600 millimeters (44 to 63 inches)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Buffalo Tiger soils-do not have limestone bedrock within 203 centimeters (80 inches) and occur in similar landform positions.
Gator Lake soils--have limestone bedrock within 5 to 18 centimeters (2 to 7 inches) of the surface and occur in similar landform positions.
Loxahatche soils--are very deep, lack limestone substratum within 203 centimeters (80 inches) and are in similar landform positions.
Macks Camp soils--have bedrock at depths of 100 to 150 centimeters (40 to 60 inches) and occur on similar landform positions. 
Plantation soils--have sandy layers below the organic layer and above the limestone bedrock.
Shark Valley soils--have bedrock at depths of 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) and are in similar landform positions.
Tamiami soils--have subsurface horizons of freshwater marl that compose less than 1/2 the thickness of the control section and occur in similar landform positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class: Very poorly drained.
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (KSAT): High to very high throughout.
Permeability: Rapid throughout. 
Surface Runoff: Negligible.
Ponding: Under natural conditions the soil is covered by water (ponded) - very frequently for very long duration 9 to 11 months, currently ponding is controlled by anthropogenic activities.
Hydric Indicators: A1 Histosol, A3 Black Histic, A8 Muck Presence, and A12 Thick Dark Surface

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses: Water quality, water storage, and wildlife habitat. 
Dominant Vegetation: Sawgrass, sedges, lilies, spikerush, willow, elderberry, pond apple, and cypress.
