CHUCKANUT SERIES

The Chuckanut series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and colluvium from sandstone over glacial till. These soils are on hills and mountain slopes and have slopes ranging from 5 to 65 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C, and average annual precipitation is about 1015 mm.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Constitution, Kapowsin, Menzel, Sadie, and Skipjack series.  Constitution is moderately deep to bedrock.  Kapowsin soils formed in dense glacial till, have redoximorphic features within 100 cm, and are 50 to 100 cm deep to a pan cemented with aluminum, iron, and organic matter. Menzel soils are dry less than 45 days. Sadie soils have a densic contact at 65 to 100 cm and have redoximorphic features within 100 cm. Skipjack soils are greater than 150 cm to a lithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chuckanut soils are on hillslopes and mountain slopes with slopes of 5 to 65 percent. Elevation ranges from 100 to 600 meters. The soils formed in volcanic ash and colluvium from sandstone and glacial till. Chuckanut soils have a marine climate with dry, warm summers and cool, moist winters with intermittent snow cover. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 10 degrees C, and the average annual precipitation is 890 to 1150 mm. The frost-free season is 160 to 200 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Barneston, Cathcart, Ovall, Skipopa, Squires, and Tokul. Barneston soils are sandy- skeletal. Cathcart does not have contrasting particle size classes. Ovall and Squires soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Skipopa soils are clayey and have an argillic horizon. Tokul soils are moderately deep to ortstein. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used primarily for woodland. Native vegetation includes Douglas-fir, western hemlock, western redcedar, and red alder, with an undergrowth of salal, western brackenfern, western swordfern, Oregon-grape, red huckleberry, deer fern, princes pine, bedstraw, and Pacific trillium. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Washington. These soils are moderately extensive.

12/2012 - This OSD was updated in 2012 as part of a SDJR project.  At that time, Chuckanut was classified as an Ashy over loamy, amorphic over istoic, mesic Typic Vitrixerands.  There was no strong evidence to support this classification, therefore it was changed to an updated version of its original classification and concept. It is recommended that samples are collected for analysis to verify the presence or absence of andic and spodic soil properties. 

4/94 - Classification was changed to Ashy over loamy, amorphic over isotic, mesic Typic Vitrixerands from medial, mesic Andic Xerocherpet
