COOERS SERIES

The Cooers series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium derived from baked hard sandstone (scoria) and shale.  These soils are on sedimentary plains, hills, and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 2 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cooers loam, in grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 4 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 5 inches thick)

    Bw--4 to 15 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak coarse subangular blocky; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 5 percent channers; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 16 inches thick)

    Bk1--15 to 19 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 5 percent hard channers; disseminated lime; many faint coats of lime on channers; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 12 inches thick)

    Bk2--19 to 38 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common very fine pores; 10 percent hard channers; disseminated lime; continuous faint coats of lime of channers; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); gradual smooth boundary. (8 to 25 inches thick)

    BC--38 to 60 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) channery loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; 20 percent hard channers; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8).

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Rosebud County, Montana, 1985.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT0168, MT7043.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches (A, part of Bw horizons); a cambic horizon from 4 to 15 inches (Bw horizon); accumulation of carbonates from 15 to 38 inches (Bk1, Bk2 horizons); and a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (part of Bw, Bk1, Bk2, part of BC horizon).   Cooers soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.

Classification changed from Borollic Camborthids to Aridic Ustochrepts.
