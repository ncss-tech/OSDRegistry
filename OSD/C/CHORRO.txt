CHORRO SERIES

The Chorro series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. Chorro soils are on flood plains, basin floors, and alluvial fans. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, thermic Sodic Ustic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Chorro silt loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 5 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak thin platy parting to weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine irregular and tubular pores; slightly effervescent, 7 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick)

    Bknyz1--5 to 14 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate very fine and fine prismatic parting to moderate fine angular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and very plastic; many very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine irregular and tubular pores; many fine soft calcium carbonate and gypsum masses; strongly effervescent, 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2); abrupt wavy boundary.

    Bknyz2--14 to 27 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) loam, brown (7.5YR 5/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many fine and common medium vesicular pores; few fine gypsum crystals throughout; common fine and medium soft calcium carbonate and gypsum masses; violently effervescent, 16 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.4); clear wavy boundary.

    Bknyz3--27 to 60 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/3) fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; many fine and common medium vesicular pores; common fine gypsum crystals; common fine and medium soft calcium carbonate and gypsum masses; common distinct organic coatings on ped faces and in root pores; violently effervescent, 19 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.6). (Combined thickness of the Bknyz horizons is 30 to 50 inches)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chorro soils are on flood plains, basin floors, and alluvial fans that occur at elevations of 3,600 to 4,100 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December to February.  The mean annual air temperature is 60 to 67 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 230 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Riveroad, Ubik and Guest soils.  These soils do not contain salts.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation includes alkali sacaton, tobosa, sideoats grama, and other annual grasses and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Arizona.  Chorro soils are of moderate extent.  El Chorro is a large lake in Mexico.  MLRA is 41.
