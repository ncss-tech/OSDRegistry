COMETCRIK SERIES 

The Cometcrik series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  These soils are on flood plains, flood plain steps and drainageways.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Cumulic Endoaquolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cometcrik loam, in grassland (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted). 

     A--0 to 12 inches; black (10YR 2/1) loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; moderate fine granular structure; hard, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and common medium roots; many fine and very fine pores; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual smooth boundary. (9 to 18 inches thick) 

     Bw--12 to 24 inches; black (10YR 2/1) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) dry; few fine distinct yellowish red (5YR 4/6) dry, redox concentrations; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and common fine and medium roots; many very fine and common fine pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (9 to 18 inches thick) 

     Cg--24 to 42 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silty clay loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) dry; common fine distinct yellowish red (5YR 4/6) dry, redox concentrations; massive; extremely hard, firm, very sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine pores; 5 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary. (12 to 30 inches thick) 

     2Cg--42 to 58 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loamy coarse sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; massive; hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 30 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 30 inches thick) 

     3Cg--58 to 60 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam consisting of fine strata of very fine sandy loam and silty clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; common medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) dry, redox concentrations; massive; very hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; 5 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.0).
