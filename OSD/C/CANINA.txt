SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Stevens County, Kansas; 2003.

REMARKS:  These soils were previously included with the Ulysses series that was correlated in areas now identified as MLRA 77A.

Series revised as part of the SDJR initiative, 2016.  The pedon type location and description was moved a site with supporting KSSL data.  Range in characteristics and horizon data were changed.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 33 cm (0 to 13 in) (A1, A2 horizons) 
Argillic horizon: 33 to 138 cm (13 to 54 in) (Btk horizons)
Calcic horizon: 15 to 203 cm (6 to 80 in) (BCk horizon)
