CHIPPEWA HARBOR SERIES 

The Chippewa Harbor series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy glacial till underlain by igneous or metamorphic bedrock. These soils are on ground moraines. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and slow or very slow in the lower part. Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 800 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, isotic, frigid Fragic Haplorthods

(10 to 40 centimeters thick) 

  2R--81 centimeters (32 inches); basalt bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES: There are none.  The closely related Michigamme series may compete when the mineralogy class is updated.  The Michigamme series lacks redoximorphic features within 100 centimeters of the soil surface.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Michigamme, Montreal, Arcadian, Quetico, Bugcreek and Peshekee soils:
Michigamme - well drained soils with bedrock at depths of 50 to 100 centimeters on higher or more sloping landscape positions
Montreal - very deep, moderately well drained soils with a fragipan on similar landscape positions
Arcadian - well drained, loamy-skeletal soils with bedrock at depths of 25 to 50 centimeters on higher or more sloping landscape positions 
Quetico - well drained soils with bedrock at depths of 10 to 25 centimeters on higher or more sloping landscape positions
Bugcreek - very deep, poorly drained soils in depressions
Peshekee - well drained soils with bedrock at depths of 25 to 50 centimeters on higher or more sloping landscape positions

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained 
Surface runoff is negligible to high, dependent on slope.
Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and slow or very slow in the lower part.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are forested. Principal species are sugar maple, red maple, yellow birch, white pine, eastern hemlock, paper birch, white spruce, balsam fir and quaking aspen. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Upper Peninsula of Michigan, MLRA 93B. This series is of moderate extent.
