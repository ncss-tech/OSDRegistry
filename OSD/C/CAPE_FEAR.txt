MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Cumberland County, North Carolina; 1922.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Umbric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 16 inches.  (the Ap and A horizons)

Argillic horizon - the zone between 16 and 45 inches.  (Btg1, Btg2, and Btg3 horizons)

Aquic conditions - colors with chroma of 2 or less below the surface layer caused by saturation.
