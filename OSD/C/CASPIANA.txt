CASPIANA SERIES

The Caspiana series consists of very deep, well drained, soils that formed in calcareous, silty alluvium. These nearly level soils are on natural levees of the Arkansas and Red Rivers and their distributaries. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C (66 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1270 mm (50 in).
