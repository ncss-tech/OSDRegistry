CATH SERIES

The Cath series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed volcanic rocks.  Cath soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cath soils are on fan remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,298 to 2,134 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 9 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chuckridge and Zadvar soils.  Chuckridge soils are shallow or very shallow to duripans.  Zadvar soils are shallow to duripans.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Cath soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The potential native vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, Indian ricegrass, and needleandthread.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive. The series concept is in MLRA 28B, while the main acreage occurs in MLRA 29.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lincoln County (Meadow Valley Area), Nevada, 1971.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 15 cm (A1 and A2 horizons).
Argillic horizon - The zone from 15 to 51 cm (Bt and Btk horizons).
Durinodes and duric feature - The zone from 51 to 152 cm (Bqk1 and Bqk2 horizons).
Calcic horizon - The zone from 71 to 152 cm (Bqk2 horizon).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 15 to 51 cm (Bt and Btk horizons). 

The revision of July 2008 moved the type location from the Meadow Valley Area of Lincoln County, Nevada to the location of a typical pedon in Nye County, Nevada that better represents the series concept.  This revision also updated the taxonomic classification from Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Durinodic Xeric Haplargids based on the recognition of a calcic horizon.
