CARIBEL SERIES

The Caribel series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from basalt.  They occur on plateaus and have slopes of 0 to 45 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 710 mm and the average annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Athol, Beech(T), Belton, Bookwood, Breknock, Carpenter, Cateache, Culleoka, Door, Dormont, Duffield, Dumfries, Ebbing(T), Frondorf, Grayford, Greencreek(T), Hayter, Kell(T), Lamotte, Legore, Loudonville, Manassas, Morrison, Myerville, Neshaminy, Oatlands, Panorama, Penn, Renox, Ryder, Spriggs, Sudley, Washington, Weedmark(T), Westmoreland, Wheeling and Williamsburg series.  All of these series except the Greencreek and Weedmark soils receive more than 890 mm of precipitation mainly during the summer period, and also do not contain basalt pebbles in the control section.  Greencreek soils contain less silt, and also contain 10 to 35 percent gravel and cobbles, mainly quartz.  The Weedmark soils are moderately deep or deep to a lithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform--level to steep dissected plateaus
Elevation--850 to 1025 meters
Slope--0 to 45 percent
Parent material--basalt
Mean annual precipitation--690 to 760 mm
Mean annual air temperature--7 to 8 degrees C
Frost free period--90 to 125 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is medium.  Permeability is moderately slow.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Caribel soils are used mainly for forest products, small grains, hay, and pasture.  Native vegetation is mostly Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine, with some grand fir; the understory is common snowberry, mallow ninebark, Rocky Mountain maple, willow, creambush oceanspray, pine reedgrass, and other grasses and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Caribel soils are moderately extensive in the Kooskia Area of northcentral Idaho; MLRA 43A

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Kooskia Area, Idaho, 1965

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--3 to 21 cm (A1 and A2 horizons)
Argillic horizon--21 to 187 cm (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and Bt4 horizons)
Particle-size control section--21 to 71 cm (Bt1, Bt2 and part of the Bt3 horizons)

Based on more recent knowledge of the area of Caribel soils, the taxonomic class would be Vitrandic Glossoboralfs, assuming a udic moisture regime and a frigid temperature regime.  The udic regime is based on a predicted forest habitat type of grand fir/queencup beadlily.   Some evidence in the Kooskia report suggests a grand fir/mallow ninebark habitat type; if so, a xeric regime is predicted, and the taxonomic class would be Vitrandic Haploxeralfs.  TWH 2/94
