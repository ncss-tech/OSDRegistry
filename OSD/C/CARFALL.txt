CARFALL SERIES

The Carfall series consist of very deep, well drained soils formed in noncalcareous alluvium.  Carfall soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans, sedimentary plains, and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Carfall loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated).

    A1--0 to 7 inches; dark brown (10YR 4/3) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 12 inches thick)

    A2--7 to 15 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; neutral (pH 6.8) clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 10 inches)

    Bt--15 to 32 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; strong medium and coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many very fine roots; many faint clay films on faces of peds and in pores; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (12 to 27 inches)

   BC--32 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sandy loam; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; neutral (pH 7.2).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Fallon County, Montana, 1991.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT1267.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from 0 to 35 inches (A1, A2, Bt horizons); an argillic horizon from 15 to 32 inches which is the particle-size control section (Bt horizon).  Carfall soils have a frigid temperature regime and ustic moisture regime.
