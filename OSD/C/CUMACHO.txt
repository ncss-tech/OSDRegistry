CUMACHO SERIES

The Cumacho series consists of well drained soils that are deep to shale bedrock.  They formed in eolian material and slope alluvium derived from sandstone over residuum derived from shale.  Cumacho soils are on pediments. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

Palacid, Potts, Tamarindo, Tekla, and Quagwa, soils are greater than 40 inches to the base of the argillic.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cumacho soils are on footslopes and backslopes of pediments.  They formed in eolian materials and slope alluvium derived from sandstone over residuum weathered from the Cretaceous age Mancos Shale formation.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,400 to 6,800 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Devargas, Penistaja, Riovista, Sandoval, and Skyvillage soils.  Devargas soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, have calcic horizons, and occur on treads of high stream terraces.  Penistaja soils very deep and occur on fan remnants. Riovista soils are sandy-skeletal and occur on low stream terraces.  Sandoval soils are shallow and occur on shoulders and backslopes.  Skyvillage soils are shallow to sandstone and occur on shoulders and backslopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low surface runoff; permeability is moderately slow. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Cumacho soils are used for urban development and livestock grazing.  The historic climax vegetation is blue grama, black grama, galleta, ring muhly, broom snakeweed.  The ecological site is Loamy(R036XB112NM). 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Cumacho soils are of small extent on the northern part of the Sacramento section of the Basin and Range province in northcentral New Mexico. The MLRA is 36.
