CAPAC SERIES

The Capac series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loam or clay loam till. These soils are on moraines and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Aquic Glossudalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Capac fine sandy loam, on a northwest-facing, convex, 2 percent slope about 40 meters (130 feet) long in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

[8 to 43 cm (3 to 17 inches) thick]

 Bt--38 to 51 cm (15 to 20 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam; weak very thick platy structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; firm; common prominent brown (10YR 4/3) clay films on faces of peds; few medium distinct gray (10YR 5/1) and common medium distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions in the matrix; many medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; about 2 percent gravel; neutral; clear wavy boundary. [13 to 81 cm (5 to 32 inches) thick]

 BC--51 to 61 cm (20 to 24 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam; weak thick platy structure parting to moderate thin platy; friable; common medium distinct gray (10YR 5/1) and grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions in the matrix; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) and common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; about 2 percent gravel; moderately alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary. [0 to 25 cm (10 inches) thick]

 C--61 to 203 cm (24 to 80 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam; strong very thick platy structure parting to moderate very fine subangular blocky; friable; common fine distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions in the matrix; common coarse prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; about 2 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Capac soils are on moraines and till plains of Wisconsin age. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Capac soils formed in loam or clay loam till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 914 mm (28 to 36 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.7 to 8.9 degrees C (44 to 48 degrees F). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The moderately well drained Marlette soils and poorly drained Parkhill soils are in a drainage sequence with the Capac soils. The Wixom, Metamora and Selfridge soils have coarser textured upper sola. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm (0.5 foot to 1.5 feet) below the surface at some time from September to May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderately slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used to grow corn, beans, sugar beets, small grains, and grass-legume hay. A small part is in hardwood forest, pasture, or remains idle.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 96, 97, 98, 99 in lower Michigan. The type location is in MLRA 98. The series is of large extent.
