CAMPTOWN SERIES

The Camptown series consists of very deep, very poorly drained and ponded soils. These soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits of the Beaumont Formation of late Pleistocene age. These nearly level soils are in long and narrow relict stream meander channels and depressions. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent but mainly less than 1 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 19.5 degrees C (67 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1422 mm (56 in).

Evadale soils: are poorly drained; on a higher flat landform
Gist soils: are moderately well drained; on mounds in a complex with the Evadale soils on a higher flat landscape position
Texla soils: are somewhat poorly drained; on mounds in a complex with the Evadale soils on a higher flat landscape position or as a convex ridge consociation

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for wildlife habitat.  Native trees are dominated by red maple, tupelo, cypress, and occasional water and willow oaks.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeast Texas mainly east of the Trinity River and possibly southwestern Louisiana; LRR T; Western Gulf Coast Flatwoods (MLRA 152B); moderate extent

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Orange County, Texas, 1996.

REMARKS:  These soils were formerly included with the ponded phase of the Evadale series.  The classification was changed from a Typic Glossaqualfs to Natric Vermaqualfs during the correlation of the MLRA 152B update.  Data from the Texas A&M University Soil Characterization laboratory from Hardin County,TX (S96TX-199-006) show exchangeable sodium percentages of 8 and higher in the Eg horizon.  Pedon descriptions throughout MLRA 152B and a reexamination at the series type location indicate more than 50 percent crawfish bioturbation in some portion of the profile within 100 cm (40 in) in depth.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle size control section: 20 to 70 cm (8 to 28 in).  (Btg/E1 and Btg/E2 horizons) 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 in) (A horizon) 
Cambic horizon: 13 to 20 cm (5 to 8 in)(Bg horizon)
Glossic horizon: 20 to 102 cm (8 to 40 in) (Btg/E1, Btg/E2, and Btg/E3 horizons)
Argillic horizon: 20 to 203 cm (8 to 80 in) (Btg/E horizons, Btg and Bt horizons)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data number S96TX-199-006 from a representative pedon in Hardin County, Texas.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Data from the Texas A&M University Soil Characterization laboratory exists from laboratory number S96TX-199-006 for a representative pedon in Hardin County, Texas.
