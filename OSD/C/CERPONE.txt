CERPONE SERIES

The Cerpone series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from serpentinized rocks.  Cerpone soils are on ridge tops and side slopes on ultramafic Sierra Nevada mountains.  Slopes range from 3 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches (1524 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F, (13 degrees C).
