CRUBAS SERIES

The Crubas series consists of very deep, poorly drained, slowly permeable soil that formed in alluvium from metamorphic rock.  Crubas soils are on valley bottoms and swales.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 33 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive Typic Cryaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Crubas clay loam - meadow.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    0--3 inches to 0; partly decomposed organic matter.

    A--0 to 12 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; common medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) mottles; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, sticky and plastic; many fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine interstitial pores; strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (7 to 14 inches thick)

    Cg1--12 to 34 inches; light gray (10YR 6/1) clay, gray (10YR 5/1) moist; common medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) mottles; massive; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine and very fine roots; few fine and common very fine tubular pores; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (18 to 40 inches thick)

    2Cg2--34 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 6/1) gravelly clay, gray (10YR 5/1) moist; many large distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) mottles; massive; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 20 percent pebbles; strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Rio Arriba County, New Mexico; approximately 13 miles east and 4 miles south of Chama, NM.  State plane coordinates 2,127,490 feet north and 440,625 feet east; 106 degrees, 27 minutes, 08 seconds west longitude; 36 degrees, 51 minutes, 19 seconds north latitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture:  This soil is saturated in winter, spring and early summer.

Annual Soil Temperature:  37 to 39 degrees F.

Summer Soil Temperature:  39 to 43 degrees F.

Reaction:  Slightly acid to strongly acid.

Depth to Mottles:  0 to 6 inches.

Thickness of mollic epipedon:  7 to 14 inches.

Depth to water table:  Near the surface to 20 inches.

Particle-size control section:  35 to 50 percent clay.

A horizon - Value:  2 or 3 moist.

Cg horizon - Value:  5 or 6 dry. Chroma:  1 or 2.

2Cg horizon - Value:  5 or 6 dry. Chroma:  1 or 2. Coarse fragments:  15 to 30 percent pebbles.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Crubas soils formed in alluvium from metamorphic rock on valley bottoms and swales.  This soil is associated with seeps and springs.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is 35 to 37 degrees F.  Elevation ranges from 9,600 to 10,400 feet and the frost-free period is 50 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Bywell and Croftshaw soils.  Bywell soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments. Croftshaw soils have less than 35 percent clay.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; slow runoff; slow permeability; watertable 0 to 20 inches; and floods occasionally.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Crubas soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is bluegrass, sedges, rushes, alpine timothy, shrubby cinquefoil, clover and tufted hairgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central New Mexico.  Series is of small extent.
