COLBAR SERIES

The Colbar series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from rhyolitic and andesitic rocks.  Colbar soils are on mountains and hills.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Colbar cobbly loam-rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 8 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) cobbly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; few very fine interstitial and tubular pores; 5 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles and 1 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 10 cm thick)

    A2--8 to 15 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) cobbly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 18 cm thick)

    BA--15 to 23 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) cobbly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.

    Bt1--23 to 30 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) cobbly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; few thin clay films on faces of peds, lining pores and coating rock fragments; 5 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. 

    Bt2--30 to 41 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) cobbly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine tubular pores; few thin clay films lining pores and coating rock fragments; 15 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of Bt horizons is 10 to 53 cm)

    C--41 to 53 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly loam; brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; few fine tubular pores, 10 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt irregular boundary.

COMPETING SERIES: These are Abgese, Ackley, Blacknest, Bluelight, Eusbio, Greenbrae, Hardtrigger, Harsan, Hoosegow, Hoye, Lankbush, Morfitt, Nosser, Shawave, Sidlake, Turria and Windypoint soils.  

Abgese, Ackley, Blacknest, Bluelight, Eusbio, Greenbrae, Hardtrigger, Harsan, Hoosegow, Hoye, Lankbush, Morfitt, Shawave, Sidlake, Turria and Windypoint soils lack bedrock within 100 cm. Nosser soils have a discontinuity in the lower argillic horizon with common silica durinodes.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Colbar soils are on mountains and hills. The soils formed in residuum and colluvium from rhyolitic and andesitic rocks.  Elevations are 1,453 to 2,195 meters. Slopes range from 8 to 50 percent.  The climate is cool, semiarid. The mean annual precipitation of 200 to 250 mm; average annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 110 days.
