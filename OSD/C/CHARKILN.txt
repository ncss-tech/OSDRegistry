CHARKILN SERIES

The Charkiln series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium dominated from quartzite. Charkiln soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 4 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Charkiln gravelly fine sandy loam, forest and wildlife habitat. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). The soil surface is covered by approximately 20 percent gravel and 2 percent cobbles.

	Bt3--46 to 65 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; moderately hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and medium roots; common fine tubular and many very fine interstitial pores; 3 percent faint dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) clay films coating mineral grains and on rock fragments; 5 percent pebbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2). (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 48 to 54 inches) 

TYPE LOCATION: Clark County, Nevada; about 1.2 miles south on the dirt road from Wheeler Well and approximately 3 miles south of Wheeler Well Pass on the dirt road on the west flank of the Spring Mountains; 190 feet north and 1,540 feet west of the southeast corner of section 20, T. 18, R. 55; USGS Wheeler Well, NV 7.5 minute quadrangle; 36 degrees, 21 minutes, 58 seconds north latitude and 115 degrees, 49 minutes, 14 seconds west longitude; UTM 11s, 605803e, 4025205n; NAD 83.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ascalon, Asparas, Belfon, Bresser, Cedak, Critchell, Dagflat, Datil, Featherlegs, Forgan, Hargreave, Harlan, Hemingford, Hiarc, Kirtley, Layate, Loarc, Moskee, Palmer Canyon, Recluse, Shalona, Sitcan, Sugardee, Wages, and Wolf series. The Ascalon, Datil, Palmer Canyon, Recluse, Sugardee, Wages, and Wolf soils have calcium carbonate within 20 inches. The Asparas, Belfon, Forgan, Moskee, Shalona and Sitcan soils have calcium carbonate within 40 to 60 inches. The Bresser, Critchell, Featherlegs, Layate, and Loarc soils have C horizons above 60 inches. The Cedak, Dagflat, Hargreave, Hemingford, Hiarc, and Kirtley soils have a paralithic or lithic contact above 60 inches. Harlen soils have a hue of 5YR or 2.5YR in the argillic horizon and are not derived from parent materials dominated by quartzite. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Charkiln soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 4 to 15 percent. These soils formed in alluvium dominated from quartzite. Elevations are 6,500 to 7,800 feet. The climate is sub-humid continental, with cool, moist winters and occasional summer convection storms. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches; mean annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 90 to 130 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Buckspring, Troughspring and Woodspring series. Buckspring soils have a base in the argillic horizon above 20 inches and are shallow to limestone bedrock. Troughspring soils are moderately deep to a petrocalcic horizon. Woodspring soils lack an argillic horizon. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderate  permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for forest and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is singleleaf pinyon, Utah juniper, Gambels oak, mountain big sagebrush, and prickly pear cactus. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southern Nevada; MLRA 30.  These soils are not extensive.
