CHAVARO SERIES

The Chavaro series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils. These soils formed in loamy eolian deposits from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. Chavaro soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping plains and playa slopes. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 406 mm (16 in) and mean annual temperature is 15 degrees C. (59 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kenhill (NM) and Ratliff series.
Kenhill soils; are on similar landscape positions and have petrocalcic horizons.
Ratliff soils: are on similar landscape positions, do not have an argillic horizon and a CEC activity class of superactive.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained and moderate permeability.  Surface runoff is negligible on less than 1 percent slopes and low on 1 to 3 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used for rangeland. Small areas are used for irrigated cropland. Principal crops where irrigated are grain sorghum and wheat. Climax vegetation is dominantly short grasses with a few mid grasses and includes blue grama, black grama, and buffalograss, with lesser amounts of vine-mesquite, western wheatgrass, sideoats grama, galleta, or tobosa, silver bluestem, wild alfalfa, and prairie clover. This soil has been correlated to the Loamy (R077DY042TX) ecological site in MLRA-77D.
