CORNICK SERIES

The Cornick series consists of very shallow or shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy residuum over gypsum bedrock of Permian age. These nearly level to strongly sloping soils occur on interfluves and side slopes of hills and ridges in the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78C) and the western part of the Central Rolling Red Prairies (80A). Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 737 mm (29 in), and mean annual air temperature is 16.1 degrees C (61 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Lithic Haplustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Cornick silt loam-on a 7 percent slope in rangeland, at an elevation of 504 m (1,653 ft).
     (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.) 

    A--0 to 28 cm (0 to 11 in); brown (7.5YR 4/3) silt loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2), moist; 20 percent clay; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak fine subangular blocky parting to moderate medium granular; very friable, soft; common very fine, common fine, and common medium roots; common very fine, common fine, and common medium pores; 1 percent fine carbonate masses; 3 percent medium worm casts; 2 percent subangular strongly cemented 2 to 20 mm gypsum fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary.  Thickness of the A horizon is 13 to 43 cm (5 to 17 in) 

   R--28 to 102 cm (11 to 40 in); white (5YR 8/1) strongly cemented gypsum bedrock; mass is noncalcareous, seams are calcareous; very high excavation difficulty. 

TYPE LOCATION: Custer County, Oklahoma; about 1 mile west and 2 miles south of Weatherford; from the intersection of U.S. Interstate 40 and Oklahoma State Highway 54, about 2 miles south on Highway 54 then 450 feet west in rangeland; about 450 feet west and 250 feet south of the northeast corner of sec. 25, T. 12 N., R. 15 W.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Renish and Shidler series in the same family. Similar soils are the Acme, Cottonwood, and Vinson series.
Acme soils: are more than 203 cm (80 in) deep to gypsum bedrock
Cottonwood soils: have an ochric epipedon
Renish soils: are moist for longer periods and formed over hard sandstone bedrock
Shidler soils: are moist for longer periods and formed over limestone bedrock
Vinson soils: are 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 in) deep to gypsum bedrock 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: loamy residuum over gypsum bedrock of Permian age; primarily the Moccasin Creek bed of the Cloud Chief formation and the Weatherford bed of the Rush Springs formation (Whitehorse Group)
Landscape: Dissected plains
Landform: interfluves and side slopes of hills and ridges
Slope: 0 to 12 percent
Mean annual precipitation range: 610 to 813 mm (24 to 32 in)
Thornthwaite annual P-E indices: 40 to 48 
Mean annual air temperature range: 13.9 to 17.8 degrees C (57 to 64 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 180 to 230 days
Elevation: 304.8 to 762.0 m (1000 to 2500 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cordell, St. Paul, Quinlan, Woodward, and Vinson soils.
Cordell soils: formed from red siltstone and occur on similar areas
Quinlan and Woodward soils: formed from soft red sandstone and occur on similar areas
St. Paul soils: are very deep to bedrock, have argillic horizons, and occur on broad flats
Vinson soils: are more than 51 cm (20 in) to gypsum bedrock and occur on similar areas 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage: Well drained 
Permeability: moderate in the A horizon and very slow in the gypsum bedrock 
Runoff: high on slopes less than 1 percent, and very high on 1 to 12 percent slopes. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly native range. The native vegetation is mid and short grasses, mainly sideoats grama, blue grama and little bluestem. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Oklahoma and possibly northwestern Texas; LRR H-Central Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range Region; Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78C) and the western part of the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). The series is of moderate extent.
