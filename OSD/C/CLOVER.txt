MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Halifax County, Virginia, 2003.

REMARKS: The Clover soils were previously mapped as Mayodan soils. The April 1997 adjustment of the mesic/thermic line necessitated the establishment of a  mesic counterpart.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 and 9 inches (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 9 and 32 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)

Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches
