CHASMFALLS SERIES

The Chasmfalls series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from granitic rocks, schist and gneiss.  Chasmfalls soils are on mountain slopes and pediments.  Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Coarse-loamy, micaceous, frigid Pachic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Chasmfalls gravelly sandy loam, on a northeast facing, concave, 10 percent slope on grassland and open ponderosa pine at an elevation of 8,560 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) When described on July 19, 1995 the soil was moist throughout.

    A1--0 to 4 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) gravelly sandy loam,  black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft,  very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; 15 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt wavy  boundary.  (3 to 7 inches thick)

    A2--4 to 13 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly coarse sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular  structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very  fine and fine roots; 30 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary.  (7 to 13 inches thick)

    Bw--13 to 19 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly sandy  loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky  structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic;  common very fine and fine roots;  30 percent gravel;  neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

    BC--19 to 28 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly sandy  loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive; loose,   nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

    Cr--28 to 38 inches; soft partially decomposed granite.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cathedral, Lumpyridge, Ratake, and Rofork series.  
Cathedral soils occur above or on the same landform and are shallow
Lumpyridge soils occur below or on the same landform and are very deep

Rofork soils occur above or on the same landform and are shallow

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained, rapid to very rapid runoff, moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is ponderosa pine, mountain muhly, needleandthread, Parry oatgrass, Griffiths wheatgrass, and antelope bitterbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mountains of northcentral Colorado; LRR E, MLRA 48A.  This series is of small extent.
