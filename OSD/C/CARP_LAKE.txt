CARP LAKE SERIES

The Carp Lake series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in clayey till on depressional areas of moraines and till plains.  These soils have very slow saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, nonacid, frigid Aeric Epiaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Carp Lake silty clay loam - on a 1 percent slope in forested area.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Oi--0 to 2 centimeters; loose leaf litter and twigs; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 10 centimeters thick)

    A--2 to 13 centimeters; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) silt loam, reddish gray (5YR 5/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; friable; many very fine to coarse roots; about 1 percent gravel; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 15 centimeters thick)

    Eg--13 to 25 centimeters; dark gray (7.5YR 4/1) clay, brown (7.5YR 5/2) dry; moderate coarse prismatic structure; firm; common very fine to coarse roots; common medium faint yellowish red (5YR 4/6) masses of oxidized iron; about 1 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.6); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 15 centimeters thick)

    Bw1--25 to 36 centimeters; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) clay; weak coarse prismatic structure; firm; common very fine to coarse roots; very few patchy distinct reddish brown (5YR 5/3) silt coats on surfaces along root channels and few patchy faint reddish brown (5YR 4/4), silt coats on bottom faces of peds; few coarse prominent gray (5YR 5/1), masses of reduced iron on faces of peds and many very coarse prominent yellowish red (5YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron; about 1 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.7); clear wavy boundary.

    Bw2--36 to 74 centimeters; reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) clay; weak very coarse prismatic structure; firm; few very fine to medium roots; very few patchy distinct reddish brown (5YR 5/3) silt coats on surfaces along root channels and few patchy faint reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) silt coats on bottom faces of peds; about 1 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual smooth boundary.  (combined thickness of the Bw horizons is 10 to 76 centimeters)

    BC--74 to 91 centimeters; reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) silty clay loam; weak coarse angular blocky structure; firm; very few patchy prominent gray (7.5YR 6/1) carbonate coats on bottom faces of peds and few patchy faint reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) silt coats on bottom faces of peds; few medium prominent pinkish gray (5YR 7/2) carbonate masses; about 2 percent gravel; slight effervescence; neutral (pH 7.3); gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 38 centimeters thick)

    C--91 to 203 centimeters; reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) silty clay loam; massive; very firm; few medium prominent pinkish gray (5YR 7/2) carbonate masses; about 3 percent gravel; strong effervescence; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).  (38 to 127 centimeters thick)

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Pickford series.  Pickford soils have varves in the lower horizons and contain less than 1 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: clayey till
Landform: depressions on till plains and moraines
Slope - 0 to 2 percent
Mean annual precipitation - 790 to 860 millimeters
Mean annual air temperature - 4 to 7 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Odanah, Sanborg, Badriver, and Carp Lake form a drainage sequence (catena).
Odanah  are on knolls and side slopes and in the Haplic Glossudalfs Subgroup
Sanborg  are on knolls and flats and in the Oxyaquic Glossudalfs Subgroup
Badriver  are on flats, depressions, and drainageways and are in the Aeric Glossaqualfs Subgroup

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage - a perched seasonal zone of water saturation from 30 centimeters above the surface to 30 centimeters below the surface is present at some time from November to June (poorly drained).
Surface runoff - very low
Saturated hydraulic conductivity - very slow
Flooded frequency - occasional
Flooding duration - brief

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are forested.  The major species are red maple, sugar maple, American basswood, black ash, white spruce, northern white cedar, speckled alder and balsam fir.
