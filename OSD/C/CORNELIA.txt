CORNELIA SERIES

The Cornelia series consists of excessively drained soils that formed in sandy marine sediments or eolian deposits.  These soils are on uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, siliceous, thermic Arenic Alorthods

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cornelia fine sand on a smooth convex 0.5 percent slope, in forest. (Colors are for moist soil.)

    A--0 to 7 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) fine sand; weak fine crumb structure; very friable; extremely acid; clear smooth boundary. (2 to 8 inches thick)

    E1--7 to 13 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) fine sand; single grained; loose; extremely acid; gradual wavy boundary.

    E2--13 to 39 inches; white (10YR 8/1) fine sand; single grained; loose; very strongly acid; abrupt irregular boundary. (Combined thickness of the E horizon is 20 to 48 inches thick)

    Bh1--39 to 44 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 5/2) loamy fine sand; weak fine crumb structure; friable; noncemented; sand grains well coated with organic matter; extremely acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (3 to 11 inches thick)

    Bh2--44 to 53 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) fine sand; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; noncemented; sand grains well coated with organic matter; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 14 inches thick)

    Bh3--53 to 73 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) fine sand; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; noncemented; sand grains well coated with organic matter; very strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (7 to 36 inches thick)

    Bh4--73 to 92 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) fine sand; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; noncemented; sand grains well coated with organic matter; strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (11 to 27 inches thick)

    Bh5--92 to 106 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) fine sand; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; noncemented; sand grains well coated with organic matter; strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Duval County, Florida; 2,700 feet north of Edgewood Drive, 3,000 feet east of Palmetto Avenue of Fort George Island in Land Grant 37, T. 1 S., R. 29 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are extremely acid to strongly acid throughout.  They are fine sand or sand in the A and E horizons and sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand in the Bh horizons.  Depth to the Bh horizon ranges from 30 to 50 inches.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.

The E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of  1 or 2.  Total thickness of the A and E horizons is 30 to 50 inches.

The Bh horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, and 5YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4.  This horizon is noncemented and the sand grains are well coated with organic matter.  Total thickness of the Bh horizon is more than 30 inches. The horizon is massive or has blocky or subangular blocky structure.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family. Similar series in other families are the Immokalee, Kureb, Leon, Lynn Haven, Myakka, Ona, Paola, Pomello, Ridgeland, and Rimini series. Immokalee, Leon, Lynn Haven, Myakka, Ona, and Ridgeland soils are saturated with water during the wet seasons.  Kureb and Paola soils lack a spodic horizon.  Immokalee, Myakka, Ona, Paola, and Pomello soils have mean annual soil temperatures of more than 72 degrees F.  In addition, Pomello soils have a water table at depths of 24 to 40 inches during wet seasons.  Ona and Ridgeland soils lack E horizons between the A and Bh horizons.  Rimini soils have Bh horizons within depths of 50 to 80 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cornelia soils are in nearly level to gently sloping landscapes.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.   They formed in sandy marine sediments or eolian deposits on uplands.  Annual precipitation ranges from about 50 to 60 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 65 to 70 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Kureb, Leon, Lynn Haven, and Ridgeland series and the Ortega series. Ortega soils lack a Bh horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Excessively drained; slow surface runoff.  Permeability is rapid in the A and E horizons and moderate in the B horizons.  Depth to seasonal water table is more than 80 inches.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Native vegetation is live oak, turkey oak, southern magnolia, redbay, sawpalmetto, and greenbrier with an understory of bluestems and pineland threeawn.  Portions of this soil are used for community development.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Coastal areas of Florida and possibly Georgia.   The series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Duval County, Florida; 1977.

REMARKS:  These soils were formerly mapped with the Rimini series until the concept was changed to exclude spodic horizons above depths of 50 inches.
