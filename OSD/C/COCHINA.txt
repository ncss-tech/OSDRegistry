Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 56 cm (22 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Benito and Harlingen series. Similar soils are the Arroyada, Coquat, Lomalta, Mercedes, and Monwebb soils. 
Arroyada soils: have chromas of less than 1.5 in at least the upper 30 cm (12 in); have 35 to 60 percent clay in the particle-size control section.
Benito soils: have chromas of less than 1.5 in at least the upper 30 cm (12 in); are poorly drained.
Coquat soils: have 35 to 60 percent clay in the particle-size control section; cracks that remain open more than 90 days.
Harlingen soils: occur on stream terraces of the lower Rio Grande river that do not flood or are only rarely flooded
Lomalta soils: have chroma less than 1.5 in at least the upper 30 cm (12 in) and are poorly drained.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brundage, Catarina, Chacon, Cotulla, Maverick, Montell, Pryor, Uvalde, and Winterhaven series.
Brundage soils: occur on a slightly higher landform; a fine-loamy particle-size control section; more saline throughout; and have a natric horizon.
Catarina and Cotulla soils: occur on a slightly higher landform; formed over claystone; have 35 to 60 percent clay in the particle-size control section.
Chacon soils: occur on a higher landscape position; have an argillic horizon; are well drained.
Maverick and Pryor soils: occur on a higher landscape position; are moderately deep over claystone or mudstone.
Uvalde soils: occur on a slightly higher landscape position; a fine-silty particle-size control section; have a mollic epipedon.
Winterhaven soils: occur on a similar landform; fine-silty particle-size control section; well drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. Permeability is very slow. Runoff is slow. Flooding is occasional to frequent and has very brief to long durations.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used as rangeland. Native vegetation is dominated by large mesquite; oak and elm may make up a large percent of the overstory along stream banks. Bristlegrass, Virginia wildrye, and fourflower trichloris dominate the potential herbaceous community. Mesquite, sedges, and spiny aster are persistent increasers. Retama and sneezeweed are persistent invaders. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Rio Grande Plain, Texas; LRR I, MLRA 83B; large extent.

REMARKS: These soils were formerly included as a phase of the Mercedes series.

Edited 11/2016 (RFG-GWH): Added clay content, CCE, EC, and SAR to the range in characteristics. Updated competing series, geographic setting, and associated soils sections.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - 0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 in).  (A horizon)
Vertic feature: Slickensides occur from 18 to 183 cm (7 to 72 in). (BA, Bssnz, Bssnyz horizons)
