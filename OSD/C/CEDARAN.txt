CEDARAN SERIES

The Cedaran series consists of shallow, moderately well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from welded tuff. Cedaran soils are on mountains and hills. Slope ranges from 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 350 mm and the mean temperature is 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, mesic Aridic Lithic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Cedaran gravelly ashy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered with 5 percent stones, 10 percent cobbles, and 60 percent gravel.

     A--0 to 4 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly ashy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; few very fine, common fine and few medium vesicular pores; 15 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 8 cm thick)

     AB--4 to 13 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly ashy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; few very fine and common fine interstitial, and few very fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 20 cm thick)

     Bt1--13 to 23 cm; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) very gravelly clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine, common fine and medium, and few coarse roots; common very fine interstitial; many prominent clay films on faces of peds and around rock fragments; 35 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.3); clear smooth boundary.  

     Bt2--23 to 38 cm; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) extremely gravelly clay, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, firm, moderately sticky and very plastic; few fine, medium, coarse and very coarse roots; few medium, coarse and very coarse irregular pores; many prominent clay films on faces of peds and around rock fragments; 65 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.3); very abrupt irregular boundary. (Combined thickness of Bt horizons is 22 to 43 cm thick)

     R--38 cm; hard welded tuff.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lincoln County, Nevada; about 200 meters North and 130 meters West of the Southeast corner of section 25, T. 5 S., R. 70 E.; USGS Docs Pass 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 37 degrees 28 minutes 44 seconds N and longitude 114 degrees 6 minutes 32 seconds W; UTM 11s, 755648e 4151919n; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 37.4788889 latitude, -114.1088889 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry; moist in winter and spring and for 10 to 20 days cumulative from July through September due to summer convection storms; aridic soil moisture regime that borders on ustic.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 18 to 25 cm.
Depth to Argillic horizon: 8 to 28 cm. 
Depth to bedrock: 36 to 50 cm.
Reaction: Slightly alkaline or neutral.

Particle-size control Section - Clay content: Averages 35 to 50 percent.
Rock fragments: 35 to 60 percent.

A and AB horizons
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR.
Value: 4 or 5 dry or moist.
Chroma: 1 through 3, dry or moist.
Structure: Subangular blocky or granular.
Rock fragments: 10 to 35 percent in lower horizons.
Mineralogy: 18 to 30 percent volcanic glass in the 0.02 to 2 mm fraction and averages 0.05 to 0.2 percent Al plus 1/2Fe, extracted by ammonium oxalate.  

Bt horizons
Hue:  5YR or 7.5YR.
Value: 3 or 4 dry or moist
Chroma: 2 or 3 dry or moist.
Texture: Clay or sandy clay loam.
Structure: Prismatic or subangular blocky.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Acti and Thimble series. 

Acti soils lack an AB horizon and have ashy modifiers in the argillic horizon. Thimble series have secondary calcium carbonate in the particle size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Cedaran soils are on mountains and hills. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from welded tuff. Elevation ranges from 1,550 to 2,200 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool moist winters and warm intermittently moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm. The mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C. The frost-free period is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Oakwell, Turba, and Wakansapa soils. Oakwell soils average 27 to 35 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Turba soils average 25 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Wakansapa soils average 27 to 35 percent clay and 50 to 80 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained; medium runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Cedaran soils are used for wildlife habitat and livestock grazing. The present vegetation is mainly low sagebrush, Utah serviceberry, Gambel's oak, antelope bitterbrush, desert ceanothus, greenleaf manzanita, muttongrass, and prairie junegrass with invaded singleleaf pinyon and Utah juniper. This pedon is correlated to ecological site R029XY163NV, Cobbly Claypan 12-16 P.Z. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: East-central Nevada. Cedaran soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 29.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Lincoln County, Nevada, Meadow Valley Area, 1971.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the surface to 18 cm when mixed (A, AB, and the upper portion of the Bt1 horizon).
Argillic horizon - The zone from 4 to 38 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).
Lithic contact - The contact at 38 cm (R layer).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 13 to 38 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Before 2009 the classification was frigid Lithic Haploxerolls. The type location was moved and the series reclassified to better reflect area concepts.
