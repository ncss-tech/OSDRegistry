Bt horizon:
Color--hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 6 or 8. 
The lower part of most pedons is mottled, and colors inherited from saprolite range to neutral, value of 8, and chroma of 0. 
Texture (fine-earth fraction)--clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam fraction.

C horizon:
Color--hue of 2.5YR to 5Y, or is neutral, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 0 to 8

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Distribution: Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Nelson County, Virginia, 1992.

REMARKS: 
The June 2024 revision changed the location of this series to mesic MLRA 136 from MLRA 148.  This was due to boundary line changes in the new Ag. Handbook 296.  
The September 2025 revision reformatted the description to semi-tabular.  No data was changed.
Revised=1/23/92, MHC. Revised=9/2025, DTA
