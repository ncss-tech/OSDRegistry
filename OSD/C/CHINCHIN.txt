CHINCHIN SERIES

The Chinchin series consist of very shallow and shallow well drained soils with moderately slow permeability. Chinchin soils are on hills and escarpments on structural benches and are formed in residuum and colluvium from shale. Slopes range from 25 to 50 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 50 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Lithic Calciargids 

TYPICAL PEDON: Chinchin gravelly -- rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The surface is covered by 70 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones.

	A--0 to 4 inches; reddish brown (2.5YR 5/4) gravelly loam,  reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine and medium platy parting to moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine interstitial pores; 14 percent gravel, 4 percent cobbles, and 4 percent stones; moderately effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 4 inches thick)

	Btk--4 to 10 inches; reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) clay loam, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) moist; strong fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common distinct thin clay films on faces of peds; carbonates segregated in common fine soft masses; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 15 inches thick)

	R--10 inches; Chinle shale.

TYPE LOCATION: Garfield County, Utah; Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument; south side of the Burr Trail; Pioneer Mesa Quadrangle; lat. 37 degrees 48 minutes 7.6 seconds N. and long. 111 degrees 11 minutes 59.1 seconds W.; NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture regime: Ustic aridic. Driest during May and June

Mean annual soil temperature: 47 to 52 degrees F.

Particle-size control section: 27 to 35 percent clay

Depth to lithic contact: 4 to 20 inches

Rock fragments on the surface: 35 to 75 percent, dominantly gravel

A horizon
Hue: 2.5YR, 5YR 
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 4 to 6, dry or moist
Rock fragments: 0 to 30 percent, dominantly gravel

Btk horizon
Hue: 2.5YR, 5YR
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 4 to 6, dry or moist
Texture: loam, clay loam
Clay content: 27 to 35 percent
Rock fragments: 0 to 30 percent, dominantly gravel
Reaction: moderately to strongly alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Berto (NM) series. Berto soils have a typic aridic soil moisture regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent Material: residuum and colluvium, derived from shale of the Chinle formation
Landform: hills and escarpments on structural benches
Elevation: 5,100 to 6,900 feet 
Slope: 25 to 50 percent
Mean annual air temperature: 43 to 50 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 9 to 14 inches
Frost-free period: 120 to 160 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Tekapo soils. Tekapo soils do not have argillic horizons and have a paralithic contact.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to high runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for livestock grazing, recreation, and wildlife habitat. Vegetation is shadscale, roundleaf buffaloberry, Utah juniper, bottlebrush squirreltail, galleta, and Indian ricegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South central Utah. The series is not extensive. MLRA 35.
