MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Morgantown, West Virginia 

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Caldwell County, North Carolina, 1983.

REMARKS:
Chestnut soils were previously mapped with the Ashe series. Field studies indicate that Chestnut soils have significantly higher forest productivity than Ashe soils. 
The 12/97 revision changes the family placement to coarse-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Typic Dystrochrepts per the 7th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy (1996). The CEC activity class placement is based on three pedons; S88-NC-121-005; S91-NC-111-002; and S77-TN-171-004. All three pedons have control section clay contents over 18%. Two of the three are in the active family while one is in the semiactive family. Since these soils may best fit Pigeonroost, additional future lab data may place Chestnut soils in a semiactive family. Horizon depths and runoff class were also revised at this time. The 2/99 revision updates classification to 8th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
a. Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 20 cm, 0 to 8 inches (Oe and A horizons)
b. Cambic horizon--the zone from 20 to 81 cm, 8 to 32 inches (Bw horizons)
c. Paralithic contact - the contact with weathered rock at 81 cm, 32 inches (upper boundary of the Cr horizon).
d. Series control section--the zone from 25 to 102 cm, 10 to 40 inches
