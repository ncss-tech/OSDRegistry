CAMEEK SERIES

The Cameek series consists of shallow to a duripan, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with eolian additions of loess and volcanic ash.  Cameek soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Clayey, smectitic, frigid, shallow Argiduridic Durixerolls

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Wagontire series.  Wagontire soils do not have secondary gypsum or redoximorphic features in the argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cameek soils are on fan remnants.  They typically occur on summit and backslope positions.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with eolian additions of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,525 to 2,135 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bilbo, Donna, and Kleckner soils.  Bilbo and Kleckner soils are clayey-skeletal, very deep, and do not have duripans.  Donna soils are very fine, moderately deep to indurated duripans, and have an abrupt increase in clay in the upper part of the argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained; very high surface runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Cameek soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly basin big sagebrush, Douglas rabbitbrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, Sandberg's bluegrass, phlox, and lupine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive with about 3,000 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 25.

REMARKS:  This revision of March 2001 updates the taxonomic class from Clayey, smectitic, frigid, shallow Aridic Durixerolls and corrects the geographic coordinates of the type location.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 20 cm (A and Bty horizons).
Argillic horizon - The zone from 5 to 48 cm (Bty, Btqy1, and Btqy2 horizons).
Duripan - The zone from 48 to 107 cm (Bqm1 and Bqm2 horizons).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 5 to 48 cm (Bty, Btqy1, and Btqy2 horizons).
