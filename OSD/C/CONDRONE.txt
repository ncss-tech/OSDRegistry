CONDRONE SERIES

The Condrone series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in eolian sands over alluvium from mixed igneous sources.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on inset fans of the fan piedmonts.  Slope ranges from 2 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Ustic Haplargids

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Baboquivari (AZ), Courtland (AZ), Triomass (TX), and Walkon (NM) series.
The Baboquivari and Courtland soils The Baboquivari soils are noneffervescent throughout the profile and have mean annual soil temperature of 65 to 69 degrees. The Courtland soil contain 5 to 15 percent calcium carbonates, And receive greater than 12 inches precipitation and greater than 13 percent of the total precipitation during the months of January, February, and March.
The Triomass soils have moderately alkaline Btk horizons.
The Walkon soils are moderately deep to bedrock.
