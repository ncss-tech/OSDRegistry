CAMPSPASS SERIES

The Campspass series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and material derived from sedimentary rock.  These soils are on hill slopes, fan terraces, and benches.  Slopes are 3 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Citadel (SD), Fortwingate (NM), Goldvale (CO), Kelvin (ND), Larkson (CO), McVickers (AZ), Osoridge (NM), Pylon (MT), and Zuni (NM) series.  The Citadel soils do not have a horizon of secondary carbonate accumulation and are mainly strongly acid above a depth of 58 cm.  The Fortwingate, Osoridge, and Pylon soils have lithic or paralithic bedrock at moderate depths.  The Fortwingate and Osoridge soils do not have a horizon of secondary carbonate accumulation.  Also, the Pylon soils have a very hard or hard and massive surface, and an extremely hard argillic horizon.  The Goldvale and Larkson soils do not have a horizon of secondary carbonate accumulation.  Kelvin soils do not have a horizon of secondary carbonate accumulation, or a thin dark A horizon.  The McVickers soils have the base of the argillic horizon at a depth of 100 cm or deeper, and do not have a horizon of secondary carbonate accumulation.  The Zuni soils formed in materials weathered from coarse grained granite and are free of carbonate throughout the soil.
