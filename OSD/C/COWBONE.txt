COWBONE SERIES

The Cowbone series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium on flood plains.  Permeability is moderate in the subsoil and rapid in the substratum.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 300 mm and average annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aeric Calciaquolls

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Fram and Wyndmere series.  These soils lack the contrasting sand and gravel material between 115 and 150 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cowbone soils are on flood plains at elevations of 1130 to 1525 meters.  The soils formed in alluvium.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The climate is cold and moist in winter and spring and dry in summer.  Average annual precipitation is 200 to 355 millimeters.  Average annual air temperatures are 6 to 8 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 60 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bartonflat, Bock, Bromaglin, Bursteadt, Dawtonia, Sprabat, and Tohobit series.  Bartonflat, Bock, and Bromaglin soils are on terraces and are well drained.  Bartonflat and Bromaglin soils have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections.  Bock soils are on terraces, are well drained and have thin mollic epipedons.  Bursteadt soils are on valley flats, are moderately well drained and have a xeric moisture regime.  Dawtonia soils are on mountains and fan terraces, are well drained and have argillic horizons.  Sprabat soils are on fan terraces, are well drained and lack mollic epipedons.  Tohobit soils are on valley flats, are moderately well drained and have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained.  Slow runoff.  Moderate permeability in the subsoil and rapid or very rapid permeability in the substratum.  These soils are frequently flooded from April to June for brief periods of about 3 to 5 days.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is Black cottonwood, woods rose, Basin wildrye and bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central, Idaho.  These soils are not extensive.
