CREED SERIES

The Creed series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, sedimentary plains and drainageways.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation records:  MT0296, MT0765.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - from the soil surface to 6 inches (A, E horizons); albic horizon - from 5 to 6 inches (E horizon); natric horizon - from 6 to 12 inches (Btn1 and Btn2, Btnk horizons).
