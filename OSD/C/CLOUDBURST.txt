CLOUDBURST SERIES

The Cloudburst series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till derived from igneous and metamorphic rocks.  Cloudburst soils are on moraines.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Ultic Haploxeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cloudburst extremely bouldery coarse sandy loam--forestland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered with 25 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones, and 7 percent boulders.

(10 to 20 inches thick)

    Bt3--29 to 38 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely cobbly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and common fine roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; few faint clay bridges between sand grains; 30 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones; neutral; clear wavy boundary. (8 to 14 inches thick)

    Bt4--38 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely cobbly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine, few fine, few medium, and few coarse roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; few faint clay bridges between sand grains; 30 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones; slightly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Mono County, California; on the Toiyabe National Forest about 2 miles west-northwest of the Marine Mountain Warfare Training Center; approximately 900 feet north and 600 feet west of the southeast corner of section 15, T. 6 N, R. 22 E.; USGS Pickel Meadow 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; 38 degrees 21 minutes 47.1 seconds north latitude and 119 degrees 32 minutes 44.7 seconds west longitude, NAD27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Usually moist in the moisture control section during late fall, winter, and spring; dry from mid-July through September for 60 to 80 consecutive days in the four months following the summer solstice; Typic xeric moisture regime.

Mean annual soil temperature - 44 to 47 degrees F.

Umbric epipedon thickness - 10 to 16 inches; includes the Bt1 horizon.

Depth to base of argillic horizon - 40 to more than 60 inches.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 18 to 25 percent; Rock fragments: Averages 60 to 80 percent, mainly greater than 3 inches in diameter (boulders, stones, and cobbles).  Lithology of fragments are mixed igneous and metamorphic rocks such as granodiorite, andesite, schist, and gneiss.


A horizons - Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.
Organic matter content: 3 to 5 percent.
Reaction: Slightly acid or neutral.


Bt1 horizon - Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.
Texture: Extremely bouldery coarse sandy loam or extremely cobbly sandy clay loam.
Clay content: 15 to 25 percent.
Rock fragments: 60 to 80 percent.
Organic matter content: 1 to 3 percent.
Reaction: Slightly acid or neutral.


Bt2 and Bt3 horizons - Value: 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist.
Texture: Extremely bouldery sandy clay loam or extremely cobbly coarse sandy loam.
Clay content: 18 to 25 percent.
Rock fragments: 60 to 80 percent.
Reaction: Slightly acid or neutral.


Bt4 horizon - Value: 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist.
Texture: Extremely cobbly coarse sandy loam or extremely bouldery sandy loam.
Clay content: 12 to 18 percent.
Rock fragments: 60 to 80 percent.
Reaction: Slightly acid or neutral.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chapot and Euer series.

Chapot soils have ochric epipedons, are influenced by volcanic ash in the A horizons, and have less than 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Euer soils are dominated by gravel in the particle-size control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cloudburst soils are on moraines.  They typically occur on footslope positions.  They formed in till derived from igneous and metamorphic rocks such as granodiorite, andesite, schist, and gneiss.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 7,000 to 8,300 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 30 inches, mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Aspetill and Murain soils.  Aspetill soils have mollic epipedons and a cryic temperature regime.  Murain soils have mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; low or medium surface runoff; moderate permeability (moderately high or high saturated hydraulic conductivity).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Cloudburst soils are used for forestland, recreation, watershed, and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is mainly a forest canopy of Jeffrey pine and Sierra juniper with an understory of snowbrush ceanothus, snowberry, mountain big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, and western needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern California, on the east side of the Sierra Nevada Range.  These soils are not extensive with about 1,800 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 22A.
