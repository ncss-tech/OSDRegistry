COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landscape: Lower Coastal Plain
Landform(s): tidal marshes, swamps, and low coastal flats along southern Peninsular Florida
Parent material: 230 centimeters (80 inches) sandy marine sediments
Mean annual temperature: 25 to 27 degrees C (77 to 81 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 1270 to 1727 millimeters (50 to 68 inches)
Frost-free period: 365 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  
Canaveral soils have better drainage and occur on beach dunes and ridges.
St. Augustine soils have 51 to 203 centimeters (20 to 80 inches) of anthropogenic sandy material and occur in slightly higher and/or similar landform positions.
Okaloacoochee soils are on similar positions, have black muck surface about 163 centimeters (64 inches) thick. The substratum is very dark gray to dark gray sand at about 163 centimeters (64 inches) to a depth of about 204 centimeters (80 inches).

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage class: Very poorly and poorly drained 
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (KSAT): high to very high
Permeability: rapid
Surface Runoff: negligible to very low
Depth to seasonal high water table: 0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches) of the surface.
Surface Water: can range from 15 to 122 centimeters (6 to 48 inches) during the raining season (June to November). During the months of December and January surface water can range from 15 to 91 centimeters (6 to 36 inches).  During the dry season February to May surface water ranges from 15 to 76 centimeters (6 to 30 inches).  
Flooding, tidal: surface water ranges from 0 to 122 centimeters (0 to 48 inches). 
Hydric Indicators: A6 Organic Bodies, S5 Sandy Redox, and S6 Stripped Matrix

USE AND VEGETATION:  
Major uses: water quality and wildlife habitat.
Dominant vegetation: Forested areas may include but are not limited to red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle), black mangrove (Avicennia germinans), white mangrove (Laguncularia racemosa) and button mangrove (Conocarpus erectus). Non-Forested areas may include but are not limited to various species of cordgrass (Spartina spp.), needlegrass rush (Juncus roemerianus), salt grass (Distichlis spicata), and various flowering forbs. Changes in salinity (ppt) is often the main driver between different major zones of vegetative species in both forested and non-forested areas.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Everglades and Associated Areas (MLRA 156A)
Extent: limited

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE:  Auburn, Alabama.
