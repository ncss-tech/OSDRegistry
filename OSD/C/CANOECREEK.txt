CANOECREEK SERIES

The Canoecreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone, mudstone, and conglomerate. Canoecreek soils are on mountains with slopes that range from 15 to 110 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2160 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Canoecreek soils are on linear to concave or convex positions on summits, shoulders, and backslopes on mountain slopes and ridges. Slopes are 15 to 110 percent. Elevations are 185 to 730 meters. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone, mudstone or conglomerate. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers with a marine layer influence and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1525 to 3050 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C. Frost free season is about 240 to 280 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Sproulish (CA) and Redwohly (CA) soils. Sproulish and Redwohly soils contain less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section. Redwohly soils have paralithic material between 50 and 100 centimeters. Sproulish soils are found on linear to concave or slightly convex positions on summits, shoulders and backslopes. Redwohly soils are found on convex to strongly convex positions on shoulders and summits.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained, high runoff, moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for timber production, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Natural vegetation includes Douglas-fir, tanoak, Pacific madrone, and California huckleberry. When present, coast redwood is less than 50 percent of the total composition.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coastal Redwood Belt; MLRA 4B. The series is moderately extensive.
