CAMBETH SERIES

The Cambeth series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, or residuum from semiconsolidated loamy sedimentary beds.  These soils are on sedimentary plains, hills, and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Calciustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cambeth silt loam, grassland (these are crushed colors and for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 3 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular block structure parting to weak fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; many fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick)

    Bw1--3 to 6 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; many fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 7 inches thick)

    Bw2--6 to 11 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silt loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium angular blocky; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick)

    Bk1--11 to 13 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 7/4) silt loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium angular blocky; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many fine tubular pores; few threads and masses of lime; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual smooth boundary. 

    Bk2--13 to 35 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 7/4) silt loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many fine tubular pores; few threads and masses of lime; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual smooth boundary. (Combined Bk horizons 6 to 29 inches thick)

    Cr--35 to 60 inches; white (10YR 8/1) semiconsolidated sedimentary beds that crush to silty clay loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2); common fine roots in cracks; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).
