COLAKE SERIES

The Colake series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in calcareous alluvium.  These soils are in drainageways and closed depressions on glaciated uplands.  Slope is 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Calciaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Colake silt loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 10 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) silt loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; many fine pores; disseminated lime, strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual irregular boundary. (8 to 16 inches thick)

    Bkg--10 to 19 inches; gray (10YR 6/1) silt loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; common fine pores; disseminated lime, violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear irregular boundary. (6 to 15 inches thick)

    Cg--19 to 60 inches; light gray (5Y 7/1) silt loam, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; disseminated lime, violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lake County, Montana, 1991; proposed Lake County, Montana, 1990.

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretation Record:  MT1244, MT1245.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 10 inches (A horizon); a calcic horizon from 10 to 19 inches (Bkg horizon); a particle size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bkg and Cg horizons).  Colake soils have a frigid temperature regime and an aquic moisture regime.
