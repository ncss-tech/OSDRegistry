CHEETA SERIES

The Cheeta series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from limestone and sandstone.  Cheeta soils are on canyons, cuestas, mesas and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 30 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 27 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 9.1 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Lithic Ustic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cheeta extremely channery fine sandy loam, on a east-southeast facing, convex, 60 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 1,414 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on May 13, 1993 the soil was dry throughout.  The surface is covered by about 30 percent flagstones and 50 percent channers.

    A--0 to 5 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely channery fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3), moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few coarse, medium and fine and common very fine roots; 15 percent flagstones, 5 percent cobbles, 45 percent channers; strongly effervescent (10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are finely disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 5 cm thick)

    C1--5 to 13 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very channery sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3), moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few coarse, medium and fine and common very fine roots; 3 percent flagstones, 5 percent cobbles, 30 percent channers; strongly effervescent (12 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are finely disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.

    C2--13 to 18 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very channery sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), moist; massive; friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few medium and fine and common very fine roots; 10 percent flagstones, 45 percent channers; strongly effervescent (13 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are finely disseminated, very few fine carbonate coats on bottom of rock fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary.

    R--18 to 28 cm; calcareous sandstone bedrock.

Daklos, Meriwhitica, and Teesto soils:  have mean annual soil temperature higher than 11 degrees C. (52 degrees F.)
Ednagrey soils:  have accumulations of secondary carbonates, and is moist in the soil moisture control section for a longer period in late winter and early spring
Redsun, Reef, Skos, and Windcomb soils:  have hue redder than 7.5YR

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  Slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from limestone and sandstone; bedrock is commonly the Price River and Green River Formations

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Utah, Warm Central Desertic Basins and Plateaus; LRR D, MLRA 34B; small extent.  About 2,500 hectares (6,200 acres) mapped in Emery and Sevier Counties, Utah.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Emery County, Utah, Emery Area, Utah, 2011.  Parts of Emery, Carbon, Grand, and Sevier soil survey area.   The name is coined. This sereis was proposed as a warmer and superactive counterpart of the Atchee series.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 18 cm.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 0 to 18 cm.  (A and C horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 5 cm.  (A horizon)
Lithic contact:  The contact with sandstone bedrock at 18 cm.  (R horizon)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
