COWCOULEE SERIES  

The Cowcoulee series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium from mixed sources, including loess, over limestone.  These soils occur on mountain slopes, hillslopes, canyons, and structural benches.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 500 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Calcic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Cowcoulee silt loam, in forest on a 24 percent northwest slope at an elevation of 1370 meters (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

 Oi--0 to 3 cm; slightly decomposed forest litter; clear smooth boundary. (1 to 5 cm thick)

 A--3 to 15 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, and few medium roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 25 cm thick)

 Bt--15 to 28 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong coarse and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots, common medium and coarse roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; many (50 percent) distinct clay films on faces of peds; 15 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent; disseminated calcium carbonate; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 30 cm thick)

 Btk--28 to 58 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots, common medium and coarse roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; many (50 percent) distinct clay films on faces of peds; 45 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; many medium segregated masses of calcium carbonate and disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. (15 to 30 cm thick)

 Bk--58 to 84 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravely loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 45 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; many medium segregated masses of calcium carbonate and disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (15 to 50 cm thick)

 R--84 to 152 cm; hard limestone bebrock.
