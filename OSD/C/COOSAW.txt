SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Beaufort County, South Carolina; 1975.
	
REMARKS: The classification was revised to Aquic Arenic Hapludults to reflect the changes in the seventh edition to Soil Taxonomy.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 32 inches (Ap and E horizons)
Arenic feature--the zone from 0 to 32 inches ( ap and E horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 32 to 47 inches (Bt horizons)
Aquic conditions--the soil has redox depletions and concentrations within the upper 24 inches of the argillic horizon, with periodic saturation and reduction at some time during the year
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches

ADDITIONAL DATA: Petrographic, particle-size, and engineering test data are on file for this pedon
