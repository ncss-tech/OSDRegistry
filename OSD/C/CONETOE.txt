MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Edgecombe County, North Carolina, 1976.

REMARKS:
These soils were formerly included in the Kenansville series.
Diagnostic horizons and features include:

Arenic feature - the zone from the surface to 25 inches.

Argillic horizon - the zone from 25 to 41 inches.

Hapl feature - clay decrease beginning at 41 inches.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data for particle size distribution and mineralogy is available for one pedon sampled in Edgecombe County, North Carolina.  The laboratory determinations were made at the North Carolina State University Soil Department.
