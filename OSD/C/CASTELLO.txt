CASTELLO SERIES

Typically, Castello soils have pinkish gray, calcareous, gravelly sandy loam Al horizons and thick, pinkish white, gravelly sandy loam Cca horizons.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, carbonatic, frigid Ustic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Castello gravelly sandy loam - rangeland (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A1--0 to 3 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many fine roots; 25 percent gravel; slight effervescence; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick)

    AC--3 to 9 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many fine roots; 25 percent gravel; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 8 inches thick)

     Clca--9 to 33 inches; Pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) gravelly sandy loam, pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) moist; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; 25 percent gravel; violent effervescence; lime mainly disseminated and as thin coatings on gravel; strongly alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (15 to 30 inches thick)

     C2ca--33 to 60 inches; Light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic; 25 percent gravel; strong effervescence; lime mainly disseminated and as thin coatings on the gravel.

TYPE LOCATION: Sweetwater County, Wyoming; 50 feet west of dirt road in SE1/4, NW1/4 of Sec. 34, T13N, R105W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 44 degrees to 46 degrees F. The mean summer soil temperature is 59 degrees to 65 degrees F. Depth to continuous horizons of calcium carbonate accumulation is 6 to 12 inches. Gravel ranges from 15 to 35 percent throughout. The 10- to 40-inch control section averages between 8 and 18 percent noncarbonate clay. The A1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist. It is gravelly sandy loam or gravelly loam. The Cca horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR. Texture is gravelly sandy loam or gravelly loam.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 40 to 70 percent.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Amesha, McFadden (T), Musselshell, and Richlie series. The Amesha, McFadden, and Richlie soils have mixed mineralogy. Musselshell soils are closely competing but have very gravelly IIC horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Castello soils are on gently and moderately sloping alluvial fans and terraces.  Slopes are 3 to 10 percent.  The soils formed in strongly calcareous, mixed alluvium. Annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches. Elevation is 6,500 to 7,500 feet. The mean annual soil temperature is 42 degrees to 46 degrees F. The mean summer temperature is 58 degrees to 66 degrees F. Frost-free period is 60 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brownsto, Fiveoh, and McFadden soils. Brownsto soils have mixed mineralogy and more than 35 percent gravel in the control section. Fiveoh soils have mixed mineralogy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, medium runoff, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is black sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Present known distribution limited to southwestern Wyoming.  The soils are inextensive.

SERIES PROPOSED: Sweetwater County (Red Creek Watershed area), Wyoming; 1974; Name is taken from a nearby spring.

REMARKS: These soils were formerly classified as Calcisols.
