CHURCHTOWN SERIES

The Churchtown series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in 60 to 120 centimeters of loamy sediments derived from loess and sandy bedrock residuum and in the underlying loess.  These soils are on plane to convex upland side slopes and foot slopes.  Slope ranges from 6 to 30 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 860 millimeters.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Allamakee County, Iowa, 1989.  The name is from a small unincorporated town in the county.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 23 to 73 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 152 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 23 centimeters (Ap horizon); 
argillic horizon--the zone from 23 to 152 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, 2Bt4, and 2Bt5 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Some pedons may border on the fine-loamy particle-size class.

These soils are commonly below steep and very steep soils derived from colluvium or weathered sandstone.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
