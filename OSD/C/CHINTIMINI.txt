MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Benton County, Oregon, 2004. The name is taken from the translation of the Kalapuya Indian word for Marys Peak in western Benton County, the highest point in the Oregon Coast Range. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include: 
Ochric epipedon 
Cambic horizon - from a depth of 20 to 38 inches (Bw horizon) 
Andic subgroup feature - from the mineral soil surface to a depth of 20 inches (A and AB horizon). Based on lab data.
Particle-size control section (Loamy-skeletal family) - from a depth of 14 to 44 inches (6 inches of the AB horizon, all of the Bw horizon, and 6 inches of the C horizon). 
Medial modifiers were used for those horizons meeting the andic subgroup criteria although not meeting andic soil properties. A proposal was submitted to NSSC (2000) to revise the definition of medial to also include those soil properties qualifying for the Andic subgroup under criteria #1 for andic soil properties.
The Cr over R bedrock contact is recognized as a diagnostic feature for this series. 

Depths to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral layer. 

Classification revised 08/2002 from loamy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Typic Dystrudepts to loamy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Andic Dystrudepts based on lab data from the modal pedon and associated soils. 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data available for pedons S01OR-003-012 and S01OR-003-013, NSSL, Lincoln, NE, 5/02.
