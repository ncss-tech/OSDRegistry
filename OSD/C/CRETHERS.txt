CRETHERS SERIES

The Crethers series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from welded tuff. The Crethers soils are on mountain backslopes. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 575 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4.5 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Wiltop series. 
The Wiltop soils are deep to a lithic contact and have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Crethers soils are on backslopes with north aspects of mountains. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from welded tuff. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent. Elevations are 2,500 to 2,950 meters. The climate is moist-subhumid with cold wet winters and warm dry summers. 
The mean annual precipitation is 450 to 700 mm. The mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C. The frost-free period is 40 to 60 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Murial, Notellumcreek, and Tusel series. 
Murial soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Notellumcreek soils are shallow to bedrock. Tusel soils have mollic epipedons that are 40 to 56 cm thick.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Crethers soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The potential native vegetation is mainly, an overstory of Rocky Mountain white fir and limber pine with an understory of mountain big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass and mutton grass. This site is correlated to Ecological Site F28BY063NV, Rocky Mountain White Fir and Limber Pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: East central Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28B.
