Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 575 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cooperwash soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on shoulder and backslope positions. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from quartzite and some limestone. Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. Elevations are 2,500 to 2,950 meters. The climate is moist-subhumid with cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 450 to 700 mm, the mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 40 to 60 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brokit, Kolcheck, and Successloop series.

Brokit soils have a strongly contrasting particle-size control section with 12 to 20 percent clay in the upper part and 3 to 10 percent clay in the lower part. Kolcheck soils are somewhat poorly drained and have 2 to 20 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Successloop soils have 27 to 35 percent clay and 35 to 50 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Cooperwash soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The potential native vegetation is mainly low sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass. This site is correlated to Ecological Site R28BY036NV, Claypan 14+ P.Z.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: East-central Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28B.
