CANISTEO SERIES

The Canisteo series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in calcareous, loamy till or in a thin mantle of loamy or silty sediments and the underlying calcareous, loamy till.  These soils are on rims of depressions, depressions and flats on moraines or till plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean air annual temperature is about 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 785 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Typic Endoaquolls

Saturated hydraulic conductivity--1.00 to 10.00 micrometers per second and 0.10 to 1.00 micrometers per second in the firm till, when present

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are artificially drained and cultivated. The principal crops are corn, soybeans, small grains, and legume hay. Reed canarygrass commonly dominates partially drained pasture. Native vegetation is predominantly wet-site tall prairie species such as prairie cordgrass, switchgrass, big bluestem, wooly sedge, giant goldenrod and Canada goldenrod. The native vegetation on very poorly drained ponded phases is herbaceous marsh species tolerant of excessive wetness such as, cattails, bulrushes, giant burreed, giant reed grass and hydrophytic sedges.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Dodge County, Minnesota, 1959.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 46 centimeters (Ap and A horizons); 
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 46 to 99 centimeters (Bkg1 and Bkg2 horizons);
calcareous family--carbonates in all parts between depths of 25 and 50 centimeters;
aquic moisture regime. 

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

The concepts of moderately fine and moderately coarse substratum phases were established by the MLRA-103 steering committee based on an analysis of particle-size data from Iowa and Minnesota.  The Des Moines Lobe till generally gets sandier and has less clay as one progresses south along the path of the Des Moines advance. 1/20/2011-TYPE LOCATION error was corrected. 2/2014 - USE AND VEGETATION updated.
