CEDA SERIES

The Ceda series consists of very deep, well drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on flood plains of the Ouachita Mountains, MLRA 119, and the Arkansas Valley and Ridges, MLRA 118. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, siliceous, semiactive, nonacid, thermic Typic Udifluvents 

TYPICAL PEDON: Ceda gravelly loam, in forest. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

 A-- 0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam; moderate fine granular structure; friable; 30 percent by volume quartz, sandstone and shale fragments 2 to 75mm (0 to 3 inches) in diameter; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. (13 to 41 cm (5 to 16 inches) thick) 

 C1-- 23 to 74 cm (9 to 29 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) very gravelly loam; massive; friable; 44 percent by volume quartz, sandstone and shale fragments 2 to 75mm (0 to 3 inches) in diameter; common thin strata with bedding planes; moderately acid; diffuse wavy boundary. (25 to 94 cm (10 to 37 inches) thick) 

 C2-- 74 to 165 cm (29 to 65 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely gravelly loam; massive; friable; 67 percent by volume quartz, sandstone and shale fragments 2 to 75mm (0 to 3 inches) in diameter; interrupted by few thin strata of gravel containing less than 5 percent fines; moderately acid.

Latitude (Decimal Degrees, NAD 83): 34.077125
Longitude (Decimal Degrees, NAD 83):  94.730883
Direction to the pedon: about 2 1/2 miles north of Broken Bow, Oklahoma; south side of logging road crossing the Middle Fork Yanubbee Creek; 1840 feet south of the northeast corner of sec. 31, T. 5 S., R. 25 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Solum Thickness: 13 to 38 cm (5 to 15 inches)

Rock Fragment content: 15 to 60 percent, by volume, in the A horizons; 35 to 80 percent, by volume, in the C horizons. 
Soil Reaction: Strongly acid to Slightly acid

Range in Individual Horizons:
A horizon:
Color-- hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Where moist values are 3, the A horizon is less than 18 cm (7 inches) thick.
Texture (fine-earth fraction) -- loam, silt loam and fine sandy loam 
Fragments-- make up 15 to 60 percent by volume; gravelly, very gravelly, cobbly and very cobbly modifiers are recognized
Reaction-- Slightly acid to strongly acid

C horizons:
Color-- hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6
Texture (fine-earth fraction) -- loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam and clay loam
Fragments-- make up 35 to 85 percent by volume; very gravelly, extremely gravelly, very cobbly, extremely cobbly and very stony modifiers are recognized. Erratic thin strata consisting of coarse fragments with less than 15 percent fines are common in the lower C horizon
