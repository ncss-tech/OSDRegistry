COLOSSEUM SERIES

The Colosseum series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone and dolomite. Colosseum soils are on fan aprons and drainageways. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 150 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 18.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, carbonatic, thermic Typic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Colosseum fine sandy loam, on a 4 percent slope under desert rangeland at an elevation of 804 meters. When described the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). The surface is covered by 80 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Colosseum soils are on fan aprons and drainageways. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. These soils formed in alluvium derived from limestone and dolomite. Elevation is 795 to 1060 meters (2605 to 3475 feet). Mean annual precipitation 125 to 175 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is 17 to 20 degrees C. Frost free season is 280 to 320 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Weiser soils. Weiser soils are loamy-skeletal throughout the particle size control section and are on upper fan aprons and fan remnants.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; negligible to very low runoff; moderately rapid permeability. The soils are very rarely flooded on fan aprons and occasionally flooded on drainageways. 

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. Vegetation is mainly creosotebush and white bursage on fan aprons and includes bush encelia, catclaw and Anderson wolfberry in drainageways.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern California, U.S.A. MLRA 30. The soils are of moderate extent.
