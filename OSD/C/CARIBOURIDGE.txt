CARIBOURIDGE SERIES 

The Caribouridge series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountains, foothills, and footslopes.  They formed in glacial till and outwash with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and rapid to very rapid below.  Slope ranges from 0 to 65 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is about 40 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, glassy over mixed, frigid Typic Udivitrands

TYPICAL PEDON:  Caribouridge ashy silt loam, forest; on a northeast-facing slope of 34 percent at 3,100 feet elevation.  When described on July 12, 1995, the soil was moist throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

(12 to 21 inches thick) 

    2C2--44 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) extremely cobbly coarse sand, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; few very fine mica flakes; 25 percent gravel, 40 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.4).

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the St. Helens series.  St. Helens soils have sandy loam and loamy sand Bw horizons and contain pumice fragments.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Caribouridge soils are on mountains, foothills, and footslopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 65 percent.  They formed in glacial till and outwash derived from granite and gneiss rocks, with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  Elevations range from 2,400 to 5,000 feet.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F. and average annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  The average frost-free period is 70 to 100 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dodgecreek (T), Idamont, Myrtlecreek (T), Pend Oreille, Redraven, Roman (T), and Rubycreek (T).  Dodgecreek and Myrtlecreek soils are on dissected outwash terraces and contain less volcanic ash and less than 35 percent rock fragments.  Idamont and Pend Oreille soils are on mountains and foothills and are ashy over loamy.  Redraven, Roman, and Rubycreek soils are on mountains at higher elevations and are cryic.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderate permeability in the upper part and rapid to very rapid below. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed.  Natural vegetation is mainly western hemlock, western redcedar, grand fir, Douglas-fir, western larch, western white pine, ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine, and birch with an understory of dampwoods blueberry, queencup beadlily, pyrola, western rattlesnake plantain, common princes pine,  western wintergreen, Utah honeysuckle, darkwoods violet, heartleaf arnica, myrtle pachystima, and common beargrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Idaho, and possibly northwestern Montana and northeastern Washington.  The series is not extensive.
