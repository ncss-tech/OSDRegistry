COSELY SERIES 

The Cosely series consists of very deep, excessively drained that formed in volcanic ash over alluvium, outwash, colluvium and till from mixed metasedimentary sources. These soils are on alluvial fans, outwash terraces, lateral moraines and glacial-valley walls. Slopes are 4 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1,225 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 4.0 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Andic Eutrudepts 

TYPICAL PEDON: Cosely gravelly ashy loam, in coniferous forest. This profile was described on an 8 percent slope at 979 meters elevation.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 4 cm; slightly decomposed forest litter 

    Oe--4 to 8 cm; moderately decomposed forest litter

    E--8 to 10 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly ashy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots and common fine and medium roots; common very fine irregular pores; 15 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary. 

    Bw1--10 to 26 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly ashy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, and common fine and medium roots; common very fine irregular pores; 20 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary. 

    Bw2--26 to 38 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly ashy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine irregular pores; 25 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual smooth boundary.

    2C1--38 to 49 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly coarse sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2).

    2C2--49 to 152 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely gravelly coarse sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 50 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2).
