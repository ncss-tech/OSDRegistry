CIELITO SERIES

The Cielito series consists of deep well drained soils.  Cielito soils formed in eolian material over residuum derived from gypsum.  They are on summits and footslopes of low hills. Slopes are 1 to 10 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, gypsic, mesic Ustic Argigypsids

TYPICAL PEDON: Cielito very fine sandy loam--on a footslope of a low hill sloping 2 percent to the southeast at 5,796 feet elevation--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. When described on August 14, 2001, the soil was moist from 0 to 10 inches, slightly moist from 10 to 32 inches, and otherwise dry throughout.)

(10 to 16 inches thick)

    2By2--20 to 28 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) gypsiferous loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium platy structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few medium, few fine, and common very fine roots; few fine and few very fine tubular pores; gypsum is filling entire horizon with medium sized gypsum crystals; 5 percent gravel; strongly effervescent (11 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 10 inches thick)

    2By/C--28 to 47 inches; 65 percent pale yellow (2.5Y 8/2) gypsiferous coarse sandy loam, pale yellow (2.5Y 8/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common fine and few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; many medium sized gypsum crystals; 35 percent white (N 8/0) coarse sand, white (N 8/0) moist; massive; extremely hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; gypsum is impregnating and cementing entire parts of horizon; 10 percent gravel; none to strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (10 to 22 inches thick)

    2R--47 inches; strongly cemented gypsum bedrock.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section is intermittently moist in some part from July to October and December to March.  It is assumed to be dry in all parts 50 to 75 percent of the time (cumulative), when the soil temperature at 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or higher.  The soils are driest in May and June.  The soil moisture regime is aridic bordering on ustic.

COMPETING SERIES: There are currently no competitors.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cielito soils are on shoulders and footslopes of low hills.  They formed in eolian material over residuum derived from gypsum bedrock of the Jurassic age Todilto Formation.  Slopes are 1 to 10 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,400 to 5,900 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Netoma and Tanbark soils.  Netoma soils are coarse-loamy, do not have an argillic horizon, and occur on toeslopes of low hills.  Tanbark soils are very shallow, do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons, and occur on shoulders and backslopes of low hills.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low surface runoff; permeability is slow in the upper part and moderately rapid to rapid in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: Cielito soils are used for livestock grazing and recreation.  The historic climax vegetation is spike dropseed, sand dropseed, black grama, New Mexico feathergrass, and ephedra.  The ecological site is Limy (R036XB129NM).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Cielito soils are of small extent on the northern Galisteo Basin part of the Mexican Highlands section of the Basin and Range physiographic province in northcentral New Mexico. The MLRA is 36.
