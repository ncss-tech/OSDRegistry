CHRISTOPHER SERIES


The Christopher series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in glacial outwash derived from granodiorite. The Christopher soils are on glacial outwash terraces in the tahoe basin. Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 660 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Mixed, frigid Dystric Xeropsamments

TYPICAL PEDON: Christopher Loamy coarse sand on a southeast facing (136 degree), 3 percent slope at an elevation of 1981 meters. When described on 08/09/2002 the soil was dry throughout. Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cagwin and Cassenai soils.  Cagwin is 20 to 40 inches to soft bedrock.  Cassenai is formed in colluvium on mountainslopes and has 15 to 35 percent fragments in the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Christopher soils are on glacial outwash terraces. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. These soils formed in colluvium, alluvium and glacial outwash weathered from granodiorite. Elevation is 1895 to 2090 meters. The climate is subhumid with cool dry summers and cold moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 530 to 990 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is 5 to 8 degrees C. Frost free season is 40 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Gefo, Jabu, Marla and Oneidas soils. The Gefo soils have an umbric epipedon.  Jabu and Oneidas soils have argillic horizons.  Marla is somewhat poorly drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; very low to medium runoff; rapid permeability. The soils are not flooded.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for wildflife, recreation, timber, and urban development. Vegetation is predominantly Jeffrey pine with an understory of green leaf manzanita, antelope bitter brush, mountain whitethorn, mahala mat, mules ear and lupin spp.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: These soils are of minor extent in the Tahoe Basin of California and Nevada in MLRA 22A.
