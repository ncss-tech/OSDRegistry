CLEAVMOR SERIES

The Cleavmor series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from welded tuffs and argillite.  The Cleavmor soils are on crests and side slopes of hills.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Lithic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cleavmor very gravelly loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is partially covered with 45 percent gravel and 10 percent with cobbles.

    A--0 to 10 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common medium, many fine and very fine roots; few medium, common fine and very fine tubular pores; 30 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 15 cm thick)

    AB--10 to 23 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few medium, common fine and very fine roots; few medium, common fine and very fine tubular pores; 45 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 18 cm thick)

    Btk--23 to 38 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely gravelly clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and very fine roots; few fine, common very fine tubular pores; common distinct clay skins on faces of ped and lining pores; 70 percent gravel and channers; common fine strongly effervescent carbonate seams; noneffervescent matrix; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 18 cm thick)

    R--38 cm; argillite

TYPE LOCATION:  Elko County, Nevada; approximately 4 miles northeast of Rowland, about 800 feet east and 1,800 feet north of the southwest corner of section 11, T. 47 N., R 56 E.; USGS Bearpaw Mountain 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 41 degrees 58 minutes 28 seconds N and longitude 115 degrees 37 minutes 34 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 41.9744444 latitude, -115.6261111 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry; moist in the winter and spring, dry from mid July through October; xeric soil moisture bordering on aridic.
Mean annual soil temperature: 6 to 8 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 36 to 50 cm, includes the argillic horizon.
Depth to bedrock: 36 to 50 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  27 to 35 percent.
Rock fragments:  50 to 70 percent, mainly gravel and channers.

A horizon  
Chroma:  2 or 3 dry or moist.
Structure:  Granular or subangular blocky.

Btk horizon  
Chroma:  2 or 3 dry or moist.
Texture:  Very gravelly clay loam, extremely gravelly clay loam.
Segregated carbonates:  Few to many, filaments or seams.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Anaud, Cleavage, Cropper, Gaciba, Granquin, Grosschat, Horsetrack, Mascamp, Pernty, Shalper, Slatter, and Tractuff series.  

Anaud, Cleavage, Cropper, Granquin, Grosschat, Horsetrack, Mascamp, Pernty, Shalper, and Tractuff soils all lack argillic horizons with secondary carbonates as filaments or masses. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cleavmor soils are on crests and sideslopes of hills.  These soils formed in residuum derived from welded tuffs and argillite.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 1,710 and 1,830 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 410 mm, mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Blackleg and Ebic soils.  Blackleg and Ebic soils are over 50 cm deep and have clayey-skeletal argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, Thurber needlegrass and black sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive. MLRA 25.
