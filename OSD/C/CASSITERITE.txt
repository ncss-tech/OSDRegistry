TYPICAL PEDON: Cassiterite silt loam - on a slope of 1 percent under willow/sedge scrub. (All colors are for moist soil)

	Oi--0 to 1 inch; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) slightly decomposed organic material; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; strongly acid (pH 5.5); abrupt smooth boundary.

        A--1 to 4 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) silt loam; very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); clear wavy boundary.

	Bw--4 to 9 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) and dark gray (10YR 4/1) stratified fine sand to sand; very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear smooth boundary.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this classification.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landforms: flood plains; flood plains on mountains
Parent material: sandy and silty alluvium over sandy and gravelly alluvium
Elevation: 426 to 512 feet
Slope: 0 to 12 percent
Annual precipitation: 23.5 to 24.1 inches
Annual temperature: 24.8 degrees F
Frost-free period: 60 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Boldrin, Distin, and Peluk soils. Boldrin soils are very poorly drained, shallow to moderately deep to permafrost, and occur on mountain toeslopes and footslopes. Distin soils are poorly drained, moderately deep to very deep to permafrost, and occur on stream terraces. Peluk soils are well drained, shallow to permafrost, and occur on peat plateaus on mountains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained, low to medium runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the loamy material and high to very high in the sandy-skeletal material.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for military use and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is willow/sedge scrub.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 240, Nulato Hills-Southern Seward Peninsula Highlands, Alaska. The series is of small extent.
