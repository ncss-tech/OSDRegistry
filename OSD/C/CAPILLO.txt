CAPILLO SERIES

The Capillo series consists of deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed from alluvium and colluvium derived dominantly from interbedded shales, sandstone and limestone.  Capillo soils are on mountain, hill, terrace and mesa sideslopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 510 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Capillo loam--mixed forest.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 5 cm; decomposing needles, bark, and twigs; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 5 cm thick)

    A--5 to 13 cm; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak thin platy structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 13 cm thick)

    Bt1--13 to 21 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; hard, friable, sticky, plastic; few large pores; few thin clay films lining pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  

    Bt2--21 to 34 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong fine angular blocky structure; very hard, firm, sticky, plastic; thin continuous clay films on faces of peds; few large pores; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual smooth boundary. 

    Bt3--34 to 59 cm; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; very hard, firm, sticky, plastic; few fine pores; thin continuous clay films on faces of peds; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of Bt1, Bt2 and Bt3 horizons - 25 to 80 cm)

    Bt4--59 to 82 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak angular blocky structure; very hard, firm, sticky, plastic; few fine pores; few thin patchy clay films on faces of peds; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 30 cm thick)

    C--82 to 107 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silty clay, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak angular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky, plastic; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (20 to 90 cm thick)

    2Cr--107 to 158 cm; Soft shale with partially weathered thin, fractured layers or coarse fragments of sandstone; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Barela(NM), Charo(NM), Darret(MT), Fergus(MT), Microy(NM), Moreno(NM), Pino(NM), Terrad(MT), Turkeysprings(MT), Wilcoxson(MT) and Zau(CO) soils.  Barela and Moreno soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the Bt horizon. Charo, Darret, Microy, Pino and Zau soils are 50 to 100 cm to a lithic or paralithic contact.  Fergus, Terrad, Turkeysprings, and Wilcoxson soils are calcareous in the lower Bt horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
