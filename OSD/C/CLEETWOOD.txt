CLEETWOOD SERIES

The Cleetwood series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in ash with pumice, cinders and andesite fragments on ash flows. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 70 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy, glassy, nonacid Vitrandic Cryopsamments

TYPICAL PEDON: Cleetwood very gravelly ashy loamy coarse sand, rangeland. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.

	A1--0 to 2 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) very gravelly ashy loamy coarse sand, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 45 percent andesite and cinder gravel; 5 percent andesite cinder cobbles and 1 percent andesite stones; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick)

	A2--2 to 10 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) ashy loamy sand, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine and few medium roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 10 percent andesite gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick)

	C1--10 to 36 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) ashy sand, pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) dry; massive; slightly hard, firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent andesite gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt wavy boundary. (15 to 30 inches thick)

	C2--36 to 50 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) ashy coarse sand, light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) dry; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine interstitial pores; 5 percent andesite gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (15 to 40 inches thick)

	C3--50 to 60 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly ashy sand, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine interstitial pores; 15 percent andesite gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4).

TYPE LOCATION: Klamath County, Oregon, Crater Lake National Park, located in a meadow north of Watchman Lookout;  Latitude 42 degrees, 56 minutes, 50.02 seconds North, Longitude 122 degrees, 10 minutes, 23.07 seconds West; NAD 83. (GPS)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The solum is 4 to 14 inches thick.  The average annual soil temperature ranges from 39 to 43 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 30 to 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The solum has andic soil properties with 60 to 90 percent volcanic glass, 0.4 to 1.5 acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron, 40 to 70 percent phosphate retention, and 3 to 10 percent 15-bar air-dry moisture content and 4 to 12 percent 15-bar water content moist. Clay content 0 to 5 percent by field estimate. Pumice content is 0 to 15 percent.

A1 horizon:
Hue - 10YR or 7.5YR
Value - 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 6 dry
Chroma - 2 or 3 moist and dry
Texture - ashy loamy sand, ashy loamy coarse sand
Rock fragment content - 0 to 55 percent

A2 horizon:
Hue - 10YR or 7.5YR
Value - 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 6 dry
Chroma - 2 or 3 moist and dry
Texture - ashy loamy sand, ashy loamy coarse sand
Rock fragment - 0 to 25 percent 

C horizon:
Hue - 10YR, 7.5YR, 5YR or 2.5YR
Value - 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry
Chroma - 2 through 4 moist and dry
Texture - ashy sand, ashy loamy sand, ashy coarse sand or ashy loamy coarse sand
Rock fragments - 0 to 25 percent
Dry consistence - loose to very firm
Glass content is over 70 percent.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Cleetwood soils are on ash flows at elevations of 5,500 to 8,000 feet. The soils formed in ash mixed with rock fragments of pumice, cinders and andesite. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and cool dry summers. The average annual precipitation is 40 to 80 inches, mainly as snow. The average annual temperature is 38 to 42 degrees F. The frost-free period is 0 to 30 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Castlecrest, Dyarock and Llaorock soils. Dyarock soils are in swales and are moderately well drained. Llaorock soils are on bedrock knobs and are medial-skeletal.  Castlecrest soils have andic soil properties throughout the solum (14 to 30 inches thick) and have an O horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Excessively drained; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for wildlife and recreation. Vegetation consists mainly of western needlegrass, newberry knotweed, Halls sedge, Shasta buckwheat and Brewers sedge.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Cascade mountains of central Oregon; MLRA 3. This series is of limited extent.
