CASSYHILL SERIES

The Cassyhill series consists of shallow, well drained soils on mountains and foothills.  They formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from fine grained quartzite and siltite of the Wallace, Pritchard, Libby and Striped Peak formations of the Belt Supergroup that is influenced with mixed volcanic ash and loess in the surface layers. Slope ranges from 5 to 65 percent. The average annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 30 inches.

COMPETING SERIES: 
Oakside - do not have an influence of mixed volcanic ash
Rufus - are dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days in the summer 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cassyhill soils are on summits and convex south-facing shoulders and back slopes of mountains and foothills. Slope ranges from 5 to 65 percent. They formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from metasedimentary bedrock, predominantly siltite and fine grained quartzite with an influence of loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash in the surface layers. Elevation ranges from 2,100 to 4,950 feet. The climate is warm and subhumid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The average annual air temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 25 to 40 inches. The frost-free period is 90 to 140 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ardenvoir, Lotuspoint and Honeyjones soils. Ardenvoir soils are on east and west-facing back slopes of mountains, are deep to a paralithic contact, and have a frigid temperature regime. Lotuspoint soils are on similar landforms, are moderately deep to a lithic contact, and have a volcanic ash mantle less than 14 inches thick. Honeyjones soils are on north-facing back slopes of mountains, are very deep, and have a volcanic ash mantle greater than 14 inches thick.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; runoff is medium to very rapid; saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, grazing, wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed. Potential natural overstory vegetation is mainly an open canopy of ponderosa pine with an understory of common snowberry, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, downy brome, common yarrow, and arrowleaf balsamroot.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Idaho, eastern Washington and possibly northwestern Montana; MLRA 43A. This soil is not extensive.
