MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Queen Anne's County, Maryland, 1995.

REMARKS:
Carmichael soils were formerly included in the Fallsington series. It is distinguished from Fallsington soils by having a particle size control section that is coarse-loamy rather than fine-loamy. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
1) an ochric epipedon;
2) an argillic horizon;
3) redoximorphic features in all layers between the Ap horizon or 25 centimeters (10 inches), whichever is deeper, and a depth of 41 centimeters (16 inches), with dominant matrix chroma of 1 or less, or of 2 or less with redox concentrations.
4) "fragic properties" - coarse prismatic structure in parts of the Btg, and brittleness in 20 to 60 percent of the Btg matrix
