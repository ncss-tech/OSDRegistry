COMPETING SERIES: These are the Kenai, Mutnala, Naptowne, and Whitsol series. Kenai soils have more than 18 percent clay in the loamy part control section. Mutnala and Naptowne soils have a weighted average of greater than 15 percent fine sands and coarser and are bisequal. Whitsol soils have stratified textures in the substratum.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Depth class: very deep
Drainage class: well drained
Parent material: ash influenced loess over glaciolacustrine deposits
Landform: moraines on till plains
Slopes: 0 to 60 percent
Climate: maritime with cool summers and long moderately cold winters 
Mean annual temperature: 33 to 36 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 15 to 30 inches. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Island, Soldotna, Spenard, and Starichkof soils. Island soils lack albic horizons and occur on subtle depressions. Soldotna soils have sandy or sandy-skeletal substratums. Spenard soils are poorly drained mineral soils in shallow depressions. Starichkof soils are poorly drained peat soils occupying bogs.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, low to high runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the upper part of the solum, moderately high or high in the lower part of the solum, and high to very high in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: Some areas have been cleared and used for potatoes,
hardy vegetables, hay, and pasture. The natural vegetation is an open growing Lutz spruce paper birch and balsam poplar, and a understory of bluejoint grass and associated forbs and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 224 Cook Inlet Lowlands, South-central Alaska.  The Cohoe series is of moderate extent.
