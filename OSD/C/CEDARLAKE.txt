CEDARLAKE SERIES

The Cedarlake series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium over clayey lacustrine deposits of Quaternary age. These soils are on shallow, closed depressions on basin floors. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 482 millimeters (19 inches) and mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (60 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in the same family. Similar soils include the Arch, Chapel, Feps, Grier, Lamesa, Lenorah, and Yellowlake series. 
 
Arch soils: have carbonatic mineralogy and do not have aquic conditions. 
Chapel and Yellowlake soils: have an LE of 6 or more in the upper 100 cm.
Feps soils: have less than 25 percent silicate clay in the particle-size control 
section and calcium carbonate equivalent of less than 5 percent in all horizons.
Grier soils: have a sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) less than 13. 
Lamesa soils: have an argillic horizon 
Lenorah soils: have chroma of 3 or more between 15 to 76 cm (6 and 30 inches) of the mineral soil surface.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: calcareous, loamy alluvium  over clayey lacustrine deposits of Quaternary age.
Landform: shallow, closed depressions on basin floors.
Slopes: 0 to 1 percent.
Mean annual air temperature: 14 to 17 degrees C (57 to 62 degrees F).
Mean annual precipitation: 432 to 533 millimeters (17 to 21 inches).
Frost-free period: 185 to 220 days
Elevation: 823 to 1311 meters (2,700 to 4,300 feet).
Thornthwaite annual P-E Index Values: 25 to 36.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the similar Arch and Lenorah series and the Drake, Gomez, Hindman, Midessa, Portales, Potter, and Tokio series.
Arch and Lenorah soils are on slightly higher landscape positions.
Drake soils are on higher landscape positions and have a SAR less than 13.
Midessa, Portales, and Tokio soils are on slightly higher landscape positions, have a SAR less than 13, and do not have aquic soil conditions.
Gomez and Hindman soils are on slightly higher landscape positions and have less than 18 percent silicate clay in the particle-size control section. 
Potter soils are on higher landscape positions and have carbonatic mineralogy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained and very slow permeability. Surface runoff is negligible on less than 1 percent slopes. A water table occurs between 0 and 102 cm (0 and 40 inches) from the soil surface during most years. These soils are frequently ponded for long to very long periods.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for rangeland or wildlife habitat.  The natural plant community is a mixture of salt tolerant grasses and grass-like plants, forbs, and shrubs.  Vegetation includes alkali sacaton, Texas dropseed, creeping muhly, joint tail, sedge and rushes, inland saltgrass and occasionally some western wheatgrass.  Forbs include portulaca sp., kochia, smartweed, dock and annual forbs.  Woody species include salt cedar, Tamarix and Baccharis being the two most prevalent species.  In areas of standing water, cattails may be present.  The established plant community may fluctuate due mainly to the degree of salinity and the hydrology.  Vegetation is sparse in extremely saline areas.  This soil has been correlated to the Wet Saline (077CY689TX) range site in MLRA-77.   

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Southern High Plains of western Texas and eastern New Mexico (sub-MLRA-77C).  The series is of minor extent.
