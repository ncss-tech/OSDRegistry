CHIJER SERIES

The Chijer series consists of deep to a duripan or very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian influenced alluvium.  Chijer soils are on basalt plains and buttes and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Durinodic Xeric Haplocalcids

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Hynes and Portneuf series.  Portneuf soils are silt loam throughout the profile.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Chijer soils are on basalt plains and buttes. These soils formed in alluvium with eolian influence.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevation is 3200 to 4600 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 8 to 11 inches.  The average annual temperature is 48 to 51 degrees F. and the frost free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ackley, Declo, Fathom (T), Kecko, Minveno, Starbuck, Taunton, Ticeska (T), and Wako (T) soils.   Ackley and Wako soils have argillic horizons.  Minveno, Taunton, and Ticeska soils have duripans above 40 inches.  Declo, Fathom, and Kecko soils contain less than 20 percent durinodes in the control section.  Starbuck soils have bedrock above 20 inches.  All these soils are on the same land form as Chijer soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; runoff is slight; permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Chijer soils are used for irrigated crops, pasture, and hay.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Chijer soils are of small extent in south central Idaho.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Gooding County, Idaho, 1993.

REMARKS:  This revision changes the classification form coarse-loamy to coarse-silty.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to 6 inches (A1 and A2 horizons)

Calcic horizon - the zone from 6 to 48 inches (Bk, Bkq1, Bkq2, Bkq3, Bkq4, Bkq5 horizons)

Durinodic Xeric feature - the zone from 16 to 24 inches - contains a layer greater than 7 inches thick with more than 20 percent durinodes (Bkq2 and Bkq3 horizons)

ADDITIONAL DATA:  This soil has been sampled by NSSL.  The soil survey sample number is S87ID-047-001 and the pedon number is 88P1.  Placement into coarse-silty based on silt plus very fine sand equals 80 to 90 percent and clay is 3 to 16 percent.
