COTTREE SERIES

The Cottree series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from quartzite, sandstone, and limestone.  Cottree soils are on flood plains.  Slopes range from 2 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

Baldfield, Paradox, and Surfaz soils do not have a mollic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, low runoff, moderate permeability.  These soils are rarely flooded.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major uses are irrigated cropland, irrigated pasture, and rangeland.  Potential native vegetation consists of basin wildrye, western wheatgrass, basin big sagebrush, and rubber rabbitbrush.  These soils have been correlated to Loamy Bottom (Basin Big Sagebrush) - 034XY009UT range site in Utah.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Uintah County, Uintah Area Soil Survey, Utah. 1998.  The name is coined.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 40 inches.
Lithologic discontinuity:  Starting at the top of the 2ABk3 horizon.

Percent calcium carbonate equivalent was determined by field calcimeters.

Taxonomic version:  Eighth Edition, 1998.

NSSL# S89UT047003.  Only the top 29 inches of the pedon were sampled.  As such, the determination of a calcic horizon based on the lab data is inconlusive.
