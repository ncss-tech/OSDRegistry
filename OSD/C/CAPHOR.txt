CAPHOR SERIES

The Caphor series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Caphor soils are on fan skirts.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Durinodic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Caphor fine sandy loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 8 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak thin platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; very few fine roots; common very fine, few fine and medium vesicular pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 13 cm thick)

    A2--8 to 18 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; very few very fine, fine and medium roots; common fine, few very fine and medium vesicular pores; 5 percent gravel; common fine carbonate coats on undersides of gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 13 cm thick)

    Bqk1--18 to 43 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, few medium roots; few fine and medium tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; l0 percent weakly cemented durinodes; few fine carbonate filaments or threads; common medium carbonate and silica coats on undersides of gravel; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary.  (15 to 53 cm thick)

    Bqk2--43 to 89 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; 55 percent light gray (10YR 7/2) discontinuous thick lenses of very hard, very firm, strong silica cementation; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; 5 percent gravel; common medium carbonate and silica coats on underside of gravel; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary.  (23 to 56 cm thick)

    2Cqk--89 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly coarse sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grained; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 30 percent gravel; common thin carbonate and silica coats on undersides of gravel; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  Lander County, Nevada, about 15 miles southeast of Austin in the north part of Big Smoky Valley; approximately 2,000 feet south and 1,300 feet west of the northeast corner of section 14, T. 17 N., R. 45 E.; USGS Birch Creek Ranch 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 20 seconds 9 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 52 minutes 47 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.3358333 latitude, -116.8797222 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist for short periods in November through May; aridic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C.
Depth to 2Ck horizon: 60 to 100 CM.
Depth to discontinuous strong cementation: 38 to 76 CM.
Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline increasing with depth.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  8 to 18 percent.
Rock fragments:  Less than 15 percent, when mixed, mainly gravel.

A horizon
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.

Bqk1 horizon
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4.
Texture:  Fine sandy loam or sandy loam.

Bqk2 horizon - Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist.
Chroma: 2 through 4.
Cementation:  20 to 60 percent discontinuous strong silica cementation in a friable matrix.
Texture:  Fine sandy loam or sandy loam.

2Cqk horizon - Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4.
Texture:  Stratified loamy sand or coarse sand, modified by 25 to 50 percent gravel.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bubus and Valmy series.  

Bubus and Valmy soils lack strong discontinuous silica cementation and sandy textured 2Ck horizons above 100 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Caphor soils are on fan skirts.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations are 1,650 to 1,770 meters.  The climate is cool, arid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 130 to 200 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is l00 to l20 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Batan, Tenabo and Unsel soils.  Batan soils have a fine-silty particle size control section.  Tenabo and Unsel soils have argillic horizons.  In addition, Tenabo soils have an indurated duripan within a depth of 50 cm.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow runoff, moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly shadscale, bud sagebrush and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Nevada.  These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28B.
