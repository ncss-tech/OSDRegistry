CARBENGLE SERIES

The Carbengle series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in residuum weathered from calcareous sandstone in Fleming and Oakville formations of Miocene age. These gently to strongly sloping soils occur on summits of interfluves and backslopes of side slopes of ridges on inland dissected coastal plain. Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, carbonatic, thermic Udic Calciustolls

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderate. Runoff is low on 1 to 5 percent slopes, medium on 5 to 12 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: The major uses are livestock grazing and hay production. A few areas are used for crop production. Improved bermudagrass and corn are the principal crops. Native vegetation consists of a tall grass prairie of little bluestem, indiangrass, and big bluestem with a few large post oak, elm, and hackberry trees along the draws and in occasional motts. Numerous other grasses and a variety of forbs occur in the native plant community.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South Central Texas; Land Resource Region J; MLRA 86B. The series is extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Washington County, Texas; 1978. The name "Carbengle" comes from the combination of the shortened form of the word "carbonatic", referring to the family mineralogy class, and the word "Engle", the name of a similar soil series.
