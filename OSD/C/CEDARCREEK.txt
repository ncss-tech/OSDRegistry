CEDARCREEK SERIES

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, active, acid, mesic Typic Udorthents 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cedarcreek very channery loam, stony, on a 3 percent bench slope in an area of trees and grass. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise indicated.)

 A--0 to 8 cm (0 to 3 inches); very dark gray (5Y 3/1) very channery loam; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many fine and medium roots; 50 percent channers and stones (70 percent sandstone and 30 percent siltstone); very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (3 to 51 cm, 2 to 20 inches thick) 

 Cl--8 to 38 cm (3 to 15 inches); olive brown (2.5 4/4) very channery loam; common yellow, brown, and gray lithochromic mottles; massive; firm; few fine and medium roots; 55 percent channers and stones (55 percent sandstone, 40 percent siltstone, and 5 percent coal fragments); very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary. 

 C2--38 to 165 cm (15 to 65 inches); dark olive gray (5Y 3/2) extremely channery loam; common yellow, brown, and gray lithochromic mottles; massive; very firm; few fine and medium roots; 70 percent channers and stones (55 percent sandstone, 40 percent siltstone, and 5 percent coal fragments); very strongly acid. (Combined thickness of the C horizons is 152 cm, 60 inches or more.)

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  MORGANTOWN, WEST VIRGINIA

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Wyoming County, West Virginia, 1984 

REMARKS:  : (1) These soils were formerly mapped as strip mine spoils; Udorthents, sandstone and mudstone, low base, or Udorthents, mudstone and sandstone, low base. (2) Under the West Virginia University proposed classification, these soils would have been classified Typic Udispolents. (3) Lithochromic mottles have inherited their colors from rocks. (4) The 8/00 revision updates this series to 8th edition Keys to Soil Taxonomy standards. The CEC activity class placement is based on sample S75WV-061-002, which averages about 0.50. 
Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 00 to 03 inches (Ap horizon) Other soil features identified with this pedon: The percentage of any rock type is less than 65 percent of the total rock fragments in the particle-size control section (10 - 40 inches C1, C2 horizons). 

2014 edit updates. Semitab formatting

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Characterization data is available from the KSSL for the following pedons correlated as the Cedarcreek series: 73PA033020, 73PA033021, 73PA033022, 73PA033024; 74PA005015, 74PA005016; 74PA019042,  74PA019044; 74PA031002; 74PA033025; 074PA125048; 075WV061002.
Mineralogy data from West Virginia University indicates that Cedarcreek soils have mixed mineralogy.
