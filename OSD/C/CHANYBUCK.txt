CHANYBUCK SERIES

The Chanybuck series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in ignimbrites with influence from volcanic ash.  The Chanybuck soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-skeletal, glassy, frigid Lithic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Chanybuck extremely bouldery sandy loam, woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is partially covered with 35 percent boulders, 5 percent cobbles, and 40 percent gravel with one-half inch of decomposed pine and white fir needles.

    A--0 to 10 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) extremely bouldery sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine and medium granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 35 percent boulders; 40 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 13 cm thick)

    Bw--10 to 18 cm; dark brown (10YR 3/3) very gravelly sandy loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; many very fine and fine interstitial and common fine tubular pores; common very fine sand coats lining pores; 40 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (8 to 15 cm thick)

    R--18 cm; ignimbrite bedrock with a thin weathering rind.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lincoln County, Nevada; in the South Pahroc Range approximately 5.25 miles south of U.S. Highway 93; about 2.75 miles southeast of the northwest corner of T. 5 S., R. 62 E., in an unsectionized area; USGS Hiko SE 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; 37 degrees, 31 minutes, and 23 seconds north latitude, 115 degrees, 2 minutes, and 49 seconds west longitude; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 37.5230556 latitude, -115.0469444 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually moist, moist in winter and spring, dry in late summer and fall; typic xeric soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.
Depth to bedrock: 13 to 25 cm.
Other features:  These horizons average 10 to 20 percent by weight volcanic glass within the very fine sand fraction.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 10 to 18 percent.
Rock fragments:  60 to 85 percent, predominantly boulders and gravel.

A horizon
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3

Bw horizon
Value: 3 or 4.
Chroma: 1 through 3.
Texture of fine earth: Sandy loam or fine sandy loam.
Consistence: Slightly hard or soft.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chanybuck soils are on mountain slopes.  These soils formed in residuum from ignimbrites with influence from volcanic glass and ash. Elevations are 1,985 to 2,350 meters.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.   The climate is cool, continental with a mean annual precipitation of 410 to 460 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the average frost-free season is about 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Brier series.  Brier soils have a loamy-skeletal control section and have mean annual soil temperatures greater than 8 degrees C.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; rapid runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Woodland and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is principally white fir, single-leaf pinyon pine, Utah serviceberry and mutton grass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Chanybuck soils are in southeastern Nevada and are of small extent.  MLRA 29.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Lincoln County, Nevada, South Part, 1992.

REMARKS:  This soil would be classified as Lithic Vitrandic Haploxerolls if a subgroup were provided in soil taxonomy.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm.  (A and Bw horizons)
Lithic contact - The contact at 18 cm. (R horizon)
