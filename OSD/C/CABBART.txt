CABBART SERIES 

The Cabbart series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material derived from semiconsolidated loamy sedimentary beds at depths of 10 to 20 inches.  These soils are on hills, ridges, escarpments, and sedimentary plains.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid, shallow Aridic Ustorthents 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cabbart loam, grassland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

(1 to 4 inches thick) 

    Bk1--3 to 7 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots and pores; few fine masses of lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. 

    Bk2--7 to 16 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 7/4) loam, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots and pores; common fine masses of lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (8.4); clear wavy boundary. (Combined Bk horizons 9 to 18 inches thick) 

    BC--16 to 18 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 7/4) loam, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; very hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots and pores; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick) 

    Cr--18 to 60 inches; pale yellow (5Y 7/4) semiconsolidated loamy sedimentary beds that crush to loam; few widely spaced vertical cracks in upper 4 to 6 inches with roots; root mat at contact of beds.

COMPETING SERIES: 

Blacksheep (MT) - has less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section; formed in materials derived from sandstone bedrock. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 

Landform - hills; escarpments; ridges; sedimentary plains; strath terraces. 

Elevations - 1,900 to 5,400 feet. Allow elevation to range to 6500 feet in MLRA 44.

Slopes - 2 to 75 percent. 

Parent material - materials derived from semiconsolidated loamy sedimentary beds of Cretaceous and/or Tertiary age. 

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers. 

Mean annual precipitation -  10 to 16 inches of which approximately three-quarters falls during the growing season. 

Mean annual air temperature - 39 to 45 degrees F. Allow MAAT to range to 38 degrees F in MLRA 44.

Frost-free period - 95 to 135 days. Allow frost-free period to range to 90 days in MLRA 44.
GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Arikara, Cambeth, Lonna, and Yawdim soils.  Delpoint and Cambeth soils are on slideslopes below the Cabbart.  They have soft bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  The Arikara and Lonna soils are very deep.  Arikara soils are on side slopes and Lonna soils are on fans.  Yawdim soils are found on similar landscapes as Cabbart soils.  They are fine textured. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly in range, but small areas are farmed to small grains.  The potential native vegetation is western wheatgrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, green needlegrass, plains reedgrass, little bluestem, needleandthread, blue grama, dryland sedges, and forbs.  Some area have low density stands of ponderosa pine and Rocky Mountain juniper. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern Montana and western North Dakota.  The series is extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Cascade County, Montana, 1969. 

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation records:  MT0050, MT0870, MT7008. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 7 inches (A and Bk1 horizons); lime accumulation - the zone from 3 to 16 inches (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons); paralithic contact - at 18 inches (Cr horizon); particle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 18 inches (Bk2 and BC horizons).  Cabbart soils have an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
