CROSSLEY SERIES

The Crossley series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from  limestone, sandstone, and dolomite.  Crossley soils are on mountain slopes, hillslopes, shoulders, and ridges. Slopes are 4 to 40 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Calcixerepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Crossley extremely gravelly loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium platy structure parting to moderate fine granular; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; 40 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; violently effervescent; secondary carbonates are disseminated throughout the matrix; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick)

    Bk1--3 to 11 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very stony sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; many very fine and fine discontinuous tubular pores; 20 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles and 25 percent stones; violently effervescent; secondary carbonates are disseminated throughout the matrix and  as pendants on bottom of rock fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 9 inches thick)

    Bk2--11 to 17 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) extremely stony sandy loam,  yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; common very fine discontinuous tubular pores; 5 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles and 30 percent stones; violently effervescent; secondary carbonates are disseminated throughout matrix and as pendants on bottom of rock fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 9 inches thick)

    R--17 inches; fractured sandstone.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Sonlet series.  Sonlet soils have an accumulation of secondary silicates.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  

Landform:  mountain slopes, hillslopes, shoulders and ridges 
Elevation:  5,900 to 7,100 feet
Slope:  4 to 40 percent
Parent material:  limestone, sandstone or dolomite
Climate:  long, cold winters; moist springs; warm, dry summers
Average annual precipitation:  12 to 18 inches
Average annual temperature:  39 to 45 degrees F.
Frost-free season:  70 to 90 days  

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Mumford, Sprollow and Lonjon soils.  Mumford soils are carbonatic.  Sprollow and Lonjon soils are carbonatic and moderately deep.  Lonjon soils also have a mollic epipedon. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very low to medium surface runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Crossley soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.   The present vegetation is mainly low sage, mountain big sage, bluegrass species, smooth brome, western wheatgrass, antelope bitterbrush and rabbit brush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho. These soils are of small extent.
