     Bt1--15 to 24 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) sandy clay loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak medium granular structure; slightly firm in place, friable when removed; common fine and coarse roots; common faint clay films on face of peds and clay bridging between sand grains; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

     Bt2--24 to 35 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) sandy loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/8) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly firm in place, friable when removed; few fine and coarse roots; few faint clay films on faces of peds and clay bridging between sand grains; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 10 to 30 inches.)

     BC--35 to 42 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) loamy sand, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) dry; weak fine granular structure; slightly firm in place, friable when removed; few roots; very few faint films bridging and clay bridging between sand grains; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 11 inches thick)

     C--42 to 60 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) loamy coarse sand, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) dry; single grain; loose; discontinuous thin iron cemented sheets and fragments of sandstone scattered throughout; very strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Monmouth County, New Jersey; about 25 feet south of Prothero Road, 100 feet west of the intersection with Hyers Mill Road, Gemmet Farm.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Solum Thickness: 30 to 50 inches
Depth to Bedrock: Greater than 60 inches. The soils lack a lithic contact but in many places they have alternating layers of thin (1/8 inch) to thick (several feet) broken sheets in the B or C horizons, of iron-cemented sandstone and loose to firm sandy material. Thick massive beds of sandstone are present only in the C horizons at depths greater than 4 feet. 
Depth to Seasonal High Water Table: Greater than 60 inches
Rock Fragments: 0 to 25 percent of the A and upper part of the B horizons and up to 35 percent in the lower part of the B and in the C horizons, mostly quartzose pebbles or sandstone chips ranging from 0.5 inch to 2 inches in diameter
Soil Reaction: Very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout the profile, unless limed
Other Features: 2 to 10 percent glauconite, by volume in the A and B horizons and 0 to 20 percent in the C horizon

RANGE OF INDIVIDUAL HORIZONS:
A or Ap horizon:
Color--hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3, chroma of 2 to 4
Texture (fine-earth fraction)--loamy sand, sandy loam, loam, or silt loam

BA or BE horizon:
Color--hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, chroma of 3 to 6
Texture (fine-earth fraction)--sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam

Bt horizon:
Color--hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 4 to 6
Texture (fine-earth fraction)--sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam

BC horizon:
Color--hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, chroma of 4 to 6
Texture (fine-earth fraction)--loamy sand, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam

C horizon:
Color--hue of 10R to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6,  chroma of 4 to 8
Texture (fine-earth fraction)--loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam

COMPETING SERIES:
Collington soils--have more than 10 percent, by volume glauconite in the particle-size control section, on similar landforms
Pineola soils--formed in residuum weathered from low-grade metasedimentary rocks and have paralithic contact between 20 and 40 inches
Royce soils--formed in residuum from dusky red shale and have lithic contact at a depth of 40 inches or more.
Saunook soils--formed in colluvium weathered from high-grade metasedimentary rocks
Statler soils--formed in alluvium derived form soils weathered from high-grade metasedimentary rocks
Trimont soils--formed in residuum weathered from low-grade metasedimentary rocks

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: Coastal Plain
Landform: Upland summits and side slopes
Elevation: 25 to 150 feet
Parent Material: Loamy marine sediments that contain glauconite. On steep slopes, iron-cemented sandstone outcrops in some places.
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 50 to 58 degrees F.
Mean Annual Precipitation: 40 to 48 inches
Frost Free Period: 160 to 190 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Adelphia soils--moderately well drained and have 10 to 40 percent glauconite in the subsoil, on slightly lower-lying landforms
Collington soils--have more than 10 percent, by volume  glauconite in the subsoil, and a subsoil hue of 7.5YR or yellower, on similar landforms
Freehold soils--have subsoil hue of 7.5YR or yellower, on similar landforms
Holmdel soils--moderately well drained, on slightly lower-lying landforms
Marlton soils--moderately well drained, have a fine-loamy particle-size control section, and more than 40 percent glauconite in the subsoil, on slightly lower-lying landforms

USE: Nearly all Colts Neck soils have been cleared and used for corn, small grains, hay, tree fruits, truck crops, and ornamental nurseries.

VEGETATION: Small isolated wooded areas are dominantly oaks but in places contain some yellow-poplar, beech and scattered individual pitch or Virginia pines.

DISTRIBUTION: Northern Coastal plain of New Jersey and possibly Maryland and Delaware

EXTENT: Small

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Freehold area, Monmouth County, New Jersey, 1913

REMARKS:  Colts Neck soils were previously classified as Typic Rhodudults. They originally had a range in value (moist) of 3 or 4 in the argillic horizon and typically have hue of 5YR and value of 4, which does not qualify them for a Rhodic great group.  The Ap horizon typically has a value of 3 and is more than 7 inches thick, indicating a humic subgroup.

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Umbric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 10 inches (A horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 15 to 35 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
