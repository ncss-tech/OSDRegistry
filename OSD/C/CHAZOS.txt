CHAZOS SERIES

The Chazos series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy and clayey alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. These soils are on stream terraces on river valleys or dissected plains. The slope range is 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 939.8 mm (37 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 19.4 degrees C (67 degrees F).
