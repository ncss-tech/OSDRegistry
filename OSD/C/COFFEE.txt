COFFEE SERIES

The Coffee series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from loess underlain by basalt.  They are on basalt plains.  Slopes are 1 to 20 percent. Permeability is moderate.  Average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Sodic Xeric Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Coffee silt loam, rangeland; on a 1 percent slope at 4,680 feet elevation with Wyoming big sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.  When described on June 19, 1979, the soil was slightly moist below 3 inches.  (Color is for dry soil unless otherwise noted.

    A1--0 to 3 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate very fine platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine vesicular pores; slightly effervescent; 2 percent basalt gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.

    A2--3 to 7 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate very fine platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; (7 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); 1 percent basalt gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the A horizons is 6 to 12 inches thick)

    Bk--7 to 16 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 10 percent hard 3/8 to 3/4 inch nodules, or cicada krotovinas; violently effervescent (25 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); 1 percent basalt gravel; 1 mm thick calcium carbonate coatings and some silica coats under rock fragments; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 20 inches thick)

    Bkq1--16 to 25 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 15 percent hard 3/8 to 3/4 inch nodules, or cicada krotovinas; violently effervescent (20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); 1 mm thick calcium carbonate coatings and some silica coats under rock fragments; 1 percent basalt gravel 2 percent basalt cobbles and 1 percent stones; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); clear smooth boundary.

    Bkq2--25 to 48 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) silty clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, sticky and plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent (20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); 1-2 mm thick calcium carbonate coatings and some silica coats under rock fragments; 1 percent basalt gravel, 5 percent basalt cobbles and 5 percent basalt stones; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6) abrupt smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the Bkq horizons is 20 to 38 inches thick)

    2R--48 inches basalt; fractures 4 to 20 inches apart

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Coffee soils are on basalt plains. Elevations range from 4,500 to 5,500 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  The parent material is alluvium from loess overlying basalt.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 11 inches with some additional moisture from snow and early spring runoff.  The average annual air temperature is about 43 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free season is 70 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Atom, Deuce, Techicknot and Menan soils. Nargon soils are moderately deep to basalt on higher positions.  Atom soils are very deep to basalt bedrock on lower positions.  Deuce soils are shallow to basalt bedrock on upland positions near rock outcrop.  Menan and Techicknot soils are very deep soils on bottomland positions with agrillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to moderate runoff, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used primarily for range and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass occasionally mixed with some junipers.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeast Idaho.  These soils are moderately extensive.
