CLIFTYCREEK SERIES

The Cliftycreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in up to 51 cm (20 inches) of loess or silty material and in the underlying loamy till and clayey residuum overlying bedrock high in carbonates. The Cliftycreek soils are on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Typic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Cliftycreek silt loam, on a northeast-facing, 4 percent slope in a cultivated field at an elevation of about 226 meters (740 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Amanda, Belmont, Belmore, Caprell, Chili, Conestoga, Crouse, Gallman, Greybrook, Hickory, High Gap, Hollinger, Kanawha, Kidder, Kosciusko, LeRoy, Lumberton, Martinsville, Military, Mocksville, Ockley, Pignut, Princeton, Relay, Richardville, Riddles, Senachwine, Skelton, Strawn, Wawaka, Wawasee, and Woodbine series. All of these soils except Gallman, Greybrook, Hickory, Kanawha, Martinsville, Ockley, Princeton, Riddles, and Skelton soils are less than 152 cm (60 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Gallman, Greybrook, Hickory, Kanawha, Martinsville, Ockley, Princeton, Riddles, and Skelton soils have less than 35 percent clay in the lower part of the argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Cliftycreek soils are on planar or convex slopes on till plains of Wisconsinan age. They are in areas of bedrock controlled topography. Slope ranges from 0 to 40 percent. The soils formed in up to 51 cm (20 inches) of loess or silty material and in the underlying loamy till and clayey residuum overlying bedrock high in carbonates. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1067 mm (36 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 12 degrees C (50 to 54 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Crosby, Fincastle, Miami, Milton, and Senachwine soils. The somewhat poorly drained Crosby and Fincastle soils are on adjacent, lower lying landform positions. The moderately well drained Miami soils are on similar positions. Milton soils have bedrock at shallower depths and are on similar or lower lying positions. Senachwine soils are formed entirely in till and are on similar positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The potential for surface runoff is low to high depending on slope gradient. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high. Permeability is moderate in the loess, and moderate or moderately slow in the underlying till and residuum. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Mostly cropped to corn, soybeans, small grains, and forage. Uncultivated areas are in forest and are used for pasture in some places. Native vegetation is deciduous forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Indiana; MLRA 111A. The series is of small extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Bartholomew County, Indiana, 2002. 

REMARKS: Cliftycreek soils were formerly mapped as Milton soils in Bartholomew County, Indiana. Closer study showed that the bedrock is deeper than originally mapped in some areas. Cliftycreek soils are anticipated to occur in adjoining counties.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 20 cm (Ap horizon).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 20 to 178 cm (Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3, 2Bt4, 2Bt5, 3Bt6 horizons).
Lithic contact: at 178 cm (top of 3R layer).

Representative data mapunit for this pedon is DMU ID 155541 in MO 11.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Transect data is on file at the MLRA Project Office in Indianapolis.
