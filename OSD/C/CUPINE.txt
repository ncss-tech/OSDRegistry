CUPINE SERIES

The Cupine series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum from sandstone on ridge tops and mountainsides.  Slopes range from 4 to 70 percent.  The average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 14 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Cupine channery sandy loam, rangeland-on a 20 percent slope on a northerly aspect at an elevation of 7,000 feet. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. When described July 1985, the profile was slightly moist throughout.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) channery sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, and coarse and common medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 15 percent channers; neutral (pH 7.1); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw1--3 to 10 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) channery sandy loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine irregular pores; 15 percent channers; neutral (pH 6.9); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 9 inches thick)

    Bw2--10 to 17 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) channery sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse platy structure parting to moderate medium angular blocky; slightly hard, firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine irregular pores; 20 percent channers; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 7 inches thick)

    2BC--17 to 23 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely channery sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 65 percent channers and 25 percent flagstones; neutral (pH 6.7); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 8 inches thick)

    R--23 inches; sandstone.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bergquist (T), Bigarm, Bradshaw, Brunzell, Fuego, Mud Springs, Potamus, St Marys and Warshod series. The Bergquist soils are 40 to 60 inches to a lithic contact. Bigarm, Bradshaw, and Brumzell soils are very deep. Fuego soils contain 5 to 30 percent pumiceous ash. Mudsprings soils are 20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact. Potamus soils have 28 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. The St Marys soils are 40 to 60 inches or more over bedrock. The Warshod soils are soils are 40 to 60 inches to paralithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform: ridgetops and mountainsides
Elevation: 5,950 to 7,700 feet
Slope: 4 to 70 percent
Parent material: residuum from sandstone
Climate: long, cold winters, moist springs,  dry, warm summers  
Average annual precipitation: 12 to 20 inches
Average annual temperature: 39 to 45 degrees F
Frost-free period: 70 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Beehunt (T), Cooley (T), and Jebo series. The Beehunt series has a pachic mollic epipedon and are on north-facing slopes with an average summer soil temperature lower than 59 degrees F.  The Cooley series has a calcic horizon, are on south-facing slopes and are deeper than 60 inches to bedrock.  The Jebo series has a calcic horizon and are on ridgetops.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained,  moderate permeability in the upper part of the profile and moderately rapid in the lower part, slow to very rapid runoff.  

USE AND VEGETATION: Use mainly for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The dominant vegetation is alkali sagebrush, rabbit brush, mountain big sagebrush, buckwheat, and bluebunch wheatgrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeast Idaho.  These soils are not extensive.
