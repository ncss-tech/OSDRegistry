CLARKSPOINT SERIES

The Clarkspoint series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash over loess on rises of plains and on shoulders of hills. Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 615 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 0.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Medial over loamy, amorphic over isotic Vitric Fulvicryands

TYPICAL PEDON:  Clarkspoint highly organic silt loam, located on a plain rise with a slope of 4 percent and elevation of 38 meters; when described on September 19th, 2007 the soil was moist throughout (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted)

 Oi--0 to 4 centimeters; slightly decomposed plant material; many very fine and fine roots, common medium roots, and few coarse roots; extremely acid, pH 4.4; clear smooth boundary

 A--4 to 10 centimeters; very dark gray (7.5YR 3/1) highly organic silt loam; 20 percent sand; 73 percent silt; 7 percent clay; weak fine granular structure; very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots, few medium roots, and few coarse roots; extremely acid, pH 4.4; clear smooth boundary

 Bhs--10 to 37 centimeters; dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) medial highly organic silt loam; 20 percent sand; 73 percent silt; 7 percent clay; moderate fine granular structure; very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots, few medium roots, and few coarse roots; very strongly acid, pH 5.0; clear wavy boundary

 BC--37 to 67 centimeters; 35 percent light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) and 30 percent brown (10YR 4/3) and 20 percent black (2.5Y 2.5/1) and 10 percent dark gray (10YR 4/1) ashy silt loam; 20 percent sand; 75 percent silt; 5 percent clay; moderate fine granular structure; very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots, common medium roots, and few coarse roots; 5 percent coarse dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) masses of oxidized iron with sharp boundaries; noneffervescent; strongly acid, pH 5.1; abrupt wavy boundary

 C--67 to 183 centimeters; 60 percent grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silt loam; 30 percent sand; 66 percent silt; 4 percent clay; massive structure; friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots, few medium roots, and few coarse roots; 40 percent medium brown (7.5YR 5/4) masses of oxidized iron with clear boundaries; moderately acid, pH 6.0
