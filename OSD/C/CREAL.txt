CREAL SERIES

The Creal series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in a mixture of loess and silty local alluvium on uplands and terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 7 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1067 mm (42 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aeric Endoaqualfs 

TYPICAL PEDON: Creal silt loam, on a nearly level area in a cultivated field at an elevation of about 125 meters (412 feet) above mean sea level (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

[Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 25 to 91 cm (10 to 36 inches).]

 BCg--140 to 152 cm (55 to 60 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam; weak coarse prismatic structure; friable; many medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; slightly acid.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Aptakisic, Caseyville, Fitchville, Iva, Kendall, Starks, Stronghurst, Waynetown and Yeddo soils in the same family. All of these soils are less than 61 cm (24 inches) to the top of the argillic horizon. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Creal soils are on uplands and terrace treads. Slope ranges from 0 to 7 percent. Creal soils formed in a mixture of loess and silty local alluvium. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 965 to 1143 mm (38 to 45 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free period is 180 to 210 days. Elevation is 107 to 183 meters (350 to 600 feet) above mean sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ava, Banlic, Belknap, Bluford, Parke, and Racoon soils. The moderately well drained Ava soils have a fragipan horizon and are on adjacent or nearby similar or steeper slopes in the uplands. Banlic soils average less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are on adjacent or nearby low terraces or elevated positions on flood plains typically at lower elevations than Creal soils. Belknap soils are on flood plains below Creal soils. Bluford soils contain more clay in the control section and are on broad upland ridges and knolls typically above Creal soils. The well drained Parke soils contain more sand in the lower part of the solum and typically are above Creal soils on loess-mantled ridges nearby. The poorly drained Racoon soils are on low terraces or elevated positions on the flood plains below Creal soils. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 31 to 91cm (1.0 to 3.0 feet) between February and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is low to high depending on slope gradient. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderately slow. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cropped to corn, soybeans, small grain, or meadow. Native vegetation is hardwood forest. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 113, 114B, 115A, and 115C in southern Illinois and southeast Iowa. The series is of moderate extent.
