CUTBACK SERIES

The Cutback series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in mixed alluvium and slope alluvium over residuum derived from tuffaceous sandstone.  These soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep hills and pediments.  Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Ustic Calciargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cutback fine sandy loam, on a convex east-facing slope of 2 percent, rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 1 inch; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine vesicular pores; 10 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (1 to 2 inches thick)

    Bt--1 to 7 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 13 inches thick)

    Btk--7 to 17 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few distinct pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent gravel; violently effervescent; calcium carbonate disseminated and as few distinct seams and soft masses; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 10 inches thick)

    2Bk1--17 to 25 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely gravelly sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; 80 percent gravel, most of which are fragments of tuff; violently effervescent, calcium carbonate as common prominent seams and soft masses; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 22 inches thick)

    2Bk2--25 to 31 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) very gravelly sandy loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; about 50 percent gravel, most of which are fragments of tuff; strongly effervescent, calcium carbonate as few medium and fine seams and soft masses; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt wavy boundary.

    2Cr--31 inches; olive (5Y 5/3) soft, calcareous, tuffaceous sandstone.

Bt and Btk horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR
Value:  5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist
Chroma:  3 or 4 dry or moist

Calcium carbonate equivalent:  0 to 20 percent
Reaction:  slightly alkaline through strongly alkaline

2Bk horizon:
Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y
Value:  5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist
Chroma:  1 through 4 dry or moist
Texture:  sandy clay loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand with either very or extremely gravelly modifiers
Rock fragments:  35 to 80 percent tuffaceous gravel
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  15 to 30 percent
Reaction:  moderately alkaline through strongly alkaline

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alogia, Antonito, Cushool, Fluetsch, Fonce, Grubrob, Hickey, Rock River, Stunner, and Wycolo series.

Alogia, Fluetsch, Fonce, Hickey, Rock River, Stunner:  do not have a lithic or paralithic contact within 40 inches of the surface

Antonito, Grubrob:  have a lithic contact between 20 and 40 inches deep

Cushool:  do not have a lithologic discontinuity with tuffaceous skeletal materials

Wycolo:  have hue redder than 7.5YR

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: mixed alluvium and slope alluvium over residuum derived from tuffaceous sandstone
Landform:  gently sloping to moderately steep alluvial fans and pediments
Slopes:  1 to 25 percent
Elevation:  5,600 to 7,800 feet
Mean annual precipitation:  10 to 14 inches of which about half falls in spring
