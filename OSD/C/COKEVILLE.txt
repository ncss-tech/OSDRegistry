COKEVILLE SERIES

The Cokeville series consists of deep, well-drained soils formed in alluvium and residuum from sandstone and conglomerate.  These soils are on hillslopes and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 5 to 35 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Slan series. Slan soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform: hillslopes and mountain slopes
Elevation: 6,200 to 7,700 feet
Slope: 5 to 35 percent 
Parent material: alluvium and residuum from sandstone and conglomerate material
Climate: long, cool winters; moist springs, and dry, warm summers.   
Average annual precipitation: 13 to 18 inches 
Mean annual temperature: 37 to 45 degrees F.
Frost-free period: 70 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Boundridge, Warshod, Pontuge and Slan series. The Boundridge soil has a duripan, is shallow, and is loamy-skeletal.  Boundridge soils form in alluvium from sandstone and quartzite on ridge tops and on terrace summits. Warshod soils have a pachic mollic epipedon, a cryic soil temperature regime, and is loamy-skeletal on hillsides and terrace sides.  The Pontuge series is moderately deep, and has a pachic mollic epipedon  on shoulders and backslopes of hills. The Slan series are moderately deep to a paralithic contact on upper backslopes and shoulders of hills. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately slow permeability; and rapid or very rapid runoff.	

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The dominant native species are mountain big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Nevada bluegrass, Indian ricegrass, arrowleaf balsamroot, and prairie junegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: This series is not extensive (less than 10,000 acres) in Southeast Idaho.
