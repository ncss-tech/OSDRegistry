CEDARSPRINGS SERIES

The Cedarsprings series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Cedarsprings soils are in valleys and drainageways.  Slopes range from 1 to 10 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, smectitic, frigid Vertic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cedarsprings loam, on a southeast facing, concave, 9 percent slope in ponderosa pine woodland at an elevation of 7,680 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on  August 12, 1999, the soil was moist from 0 to 55 inches.

    Oi--0 to 0.5 inches; slightly decomposed needle litter.

    A--0.5 to 3 inches; dark gray (2.5Y 4/1) loam, black (2.5Y 2.5/1) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick)

    AB--3 to 9 inches; dark gray (2.5Y 4/1) loam, black (2.5Y 2.5/1) moist; weak medium and  fine angular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine  roots; common very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 9 inches  thick)

    Bt1--9 to 19 inches; very dark gray (2.5Y 3/1) clay loam, black (2.5Y 2.5/1) moist; strong medium and fine angular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on ped faces; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.

(10 to 26 inches thick)

    Bt3--42 to 55 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) sandy clay loam, light olive brown  (2.5Y 5/4) moist; weak and moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable,  slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; few faint  clay films on ped faces; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 30 inches thick)

    Bt4--55 to 80 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) sandy clay loam, light olive brown  (2.5Y 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky  and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on  ped faces; neutral (pH 7.2).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bearpaw, Burnel, Cerro, Danvers, Fergus, Gerbana, Gerber, Grail, Mondamin, Montillo, Pagoda, Regent, Reget, Ridgeview, Wyola, Suposo, Tomasaki, Tsoodzil, and Yankee soils.  
Burnel, Cerro, Danvers, Fergus, Gerber, Grail, Mondamin, Pagoda, Regent, Ridgeview, Wyola, and Suposo soils have zones of secondary carbonate accumulation.
Montillo and Reget soils have bedrock above 40 inches.
Tomasaki soils are not pachic.
Tsoodzil and Yankee soils are derived from basalt.
