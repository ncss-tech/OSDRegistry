COURVASH SERIES 

The Courvash series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial till with a mantle of volcanic ash in the surface layers.  These soils are on ground moraines and mountains. Slopes are 4 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy over loamy-skeletal, amorphic over mixed, superactive, frigid Alfic Udivitrands

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretation Record:  MT1511.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a volcanic ash mantle from the mineral soil surface to 18 inches (A, Bw1 and Bw2 horizons); an ochric epipedon from the mineral soil surface to 7 inches (A, Bw1 horizons); an albic horizon from 18 to 31 inches (2E horizon); an argillic horizon from 31 to 60 inches (2Bt/E, 2Bt horizons); a particle size control section from 0 to 40 inches below the mineral soil surface (A, Bw1, Bw2, 2E, and 2Bt/E horizons).  Courvash soils have a udic moisture regime and a frigid temperature regime.
