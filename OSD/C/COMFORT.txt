COMFORT SERIES

The Comfort series consists of soils that are shallow to indurated limestone bedrock. These well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey residuum derived from dolomitic limestone of Lower Cretaceous period. These nearly level to moderately sloping soils occur on ridges on dissected plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 18.9 degrees C (66 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic Lithic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Comfort very stony clay--rangeland.   (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.) 

   A--0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 in); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very stony clay, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; very hard, very firm; many fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 15 percent, 2 to 75 mm, non-flat, angular, limestone gravel; 40 percent, 76 to 600 mm, non-flat, limestone partially on the surface and in the soil; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary. (Thickness is 8 to 25 cm [3 to 10 in]) 

    Bt--13 to 43 cm (5 to 17 in); dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2) very stony clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular and angular blocky structure parting to moderate fine angular blocky; very hard, very firm; few fine and medium roots; patchy clay films; 40 percent, 76 to 600 mm, non-flat, angular limestone; many roots matted at soil rock interfaces; slightly alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary. (Thickness is 18 to 36 cm [7 to 14 in]) 

    R--43 to 69 cm (17 to 27 in); indurated crystalline dolomitic limestone bedrock with irregular seams filled with soil.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Similar series include the Bexar, Eckrant, Hensley, Roughcreek, Rumple, Speck, Spicewood, Tarpley, and Tarrant series. 
Bexar, Rumple, and Spicewood soils: are more than 51 cm (20 in) deep to bedrock.
Eckrant and Tarrant soils: do not have argillic horizons.
Hensley soils: do not have mollic epipedons.
Roughcreek soils: have smectitic mineralogy.
Speck and Tarpley soils: have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: The soil formed in residuum weathered from dolomitic limestone of Lower Cretaceous age.
Landscape: Dissected plateaus
Landform: Summits, shoulders, and backslopes of ridges 
Slope: 0 to 8 percent, mostly less than 5 percent
Climate: Dry subhumid
Precipitation Pattern: The majority of the yearly amount occurs during the fall and spring months. The winter and summer months are normally drier.
Mean annual precipitation: 584 to 914 mm (23 to 36 in)
Thornthwaite P-E indices: 42 to 50
Mean annual temperature: 17.8 to 20.6 degrees C (64 to 69 degrees F)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brackett, Eckrant, Real, and Tarpley series.
Brackett and Real soils: do not have argillic horizons and occur on side slopes of ridges on dissected plateaus. In addition, Brackett soils do not have mollic epipedons.
Eckrant and Tarpley soils: occur on similar positions.

Drainage class: Well. 
Permeability class: Slow. 
Runoff: high on 0 to less 1 percent slopes, high on 1 to 5 percent slopes, and very high on 5 to 8 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: Mostly used for rangeland and rural homesites. Native vegetation consists mostly of Texas wintergrass, threeawns, sideoats grama, little bluestem, and indiangrass. Woody vegetation consists of Texas oak, shin oak, liveoak, Texas persimmon and pricklypear.
