CORPEN SERIES

The Corpen series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from gneiss.  Corpen soils are on pediments.  Slopes range from 5 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy, micaceous, frigid Lithic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Corpen gravelly sandy loam, on a west facing, 9 percent slope in grassland at an elevation of 7,750 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

    A--0 to 4 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak thin platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine pores; 25 percent gravel, 4 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 5 inches thick)

    Ak--4 to 9 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine pores; strongly effervescent; few fine calcium carbonate masses; 6 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 30 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (4 to 6 inches thick)

    Bk--9 to 14 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine pores; violently effervescent; many coarse calcium carbonate masses; 9 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 30 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); abrupt irregular boundary.  (5 to 8 inches thick)

    R--14 to 60 inches; indurated gneiss.

TYPE LOCATION:  Teller County, Colorado; about 6 miles southwest of Cripple Creek; about 400 feet south and 1,700 feet east of the northwest corner of sec. 31, T. 15 S., R. 70 W.; High Park USGS quad; lat. 38 degrees 42 minutes 39 seconds and long. 105 degrees 16 minutes 17 seconds, NAD 83.

COMPETING SERIES:
There are no competing series in this family. A soil in a closely related family is the Corpening series. Corpening soils have rock fragments of limestone.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium derived from gneiss
Landform:  pediments
Slopes:  5 to 25 percent
Elevation:  6,700 to 8,600 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  42 to 44 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation:  14 to 16 inches
Precipitation pattern: Monthly precipitation is lowest in winter and greatest in July and August.  
Frost-free period:  80 to 100 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cathedral and High series.  The Cathedral soils do not have a secondary carbonates.  The High soils are are very deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Potential native vegetation is mainly blue grama, Arizona fescue, Parry's oatgrass, green needlegrass, big bluestem, western wheatgrass, and mountain muhly.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Colorado; LRR E, MLRA 48A; small extent.

Taxonomic Version:  Eleventh Edition, 2010

The mineralogy class was changed from paramicaceous to micaceous in 07/2010 by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the responsible MLRA regional office.  The change was necessary based on the eleventh edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2010.
