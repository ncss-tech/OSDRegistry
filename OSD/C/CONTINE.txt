CONTINE SERIES

The Contine series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Contine soils are on fan terraces and basin floors and have slopes of 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 71 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, hyperthermic Vertic Calciargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Contine clay loam-cropland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap--0 to 12 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse granular structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to 14 inches thick)

    Bt--12 to 25 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium and coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and coarse subangular and angular blocky; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine and medium tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 14 inches thick)

    Btk1--25 to 38 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium subangular and angular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and medium tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; many fine and medium soft accumulations of lime, violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4): gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 16 inches thick)

    Btk2--38 to 47 inches: light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; few very fine and many fine roots; many fine and medium tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; many fine soft accumulations of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)

    Btk3--47 to 60 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine and medium tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; common fine and medium soft accumulations of lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

TYPE LOCATION: Maricopa County, Arizona; 75 feet south and 50 feet east of the northwest corner of Section 14, T. 1 S., R. 6 E., latitude 33 degrees, 21 minutes, 0 seconds N., longitude 111 degrees, 43 minutes, 16 seconds, W., NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture: Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July-September and December- February.  Driest during May and June. Typic aridic soil moisture regime.

Rock Fragments: Less than 35 percent

Soil Temperature: Averages 72 to 80 degrees F.

Depth to calcic horizon: 20 to 40 inches

A horizon
Hue:  5YR, 7.5YR
Value: 4, 5 or 6 dry, 3, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma:  3, 4, 5 or 6, dry or moist

B horizon
Hue:  2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR
Value:  4, 5 or 6 dry, 3, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma:  3, 4, 5 or 6, dry or moist
Texture:  clay loam, clay, sandy clay, loam, sandy clay loam

A C horizon is present in some pedons and may have textures coarser than the overlying horizons.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Contine soils are on fan terraces and basin floors and have slopes of 0 to 10 percent.  Elevations range from 100 to 3,300 feet.  These soils formed in alluvium from acid and basic igneous rocks.  The mean annual precipitation is 2 to 10 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 70 to 78 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 240 to 350 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Antho, Estrella, Tremant, Trix, Tucson and Mohall soils.  Antho soils do not have and argillic horizon.  Estrella, Tremant, Trix, Tucson, and Mohall soils are fine-loamy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained.  Medium runoff.  Slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Contine soils are used for grazing and irrigated cropland.  The present vegetation is mesquite, creosotebush, ironwood, cacti, sixweeks and sideoats grama, threeawn and alfileria.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Arizona.  This series is moderately extensive. MLRA is 40.
