CANNONBALL SERIES

The Cannonball series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in marine deposits derived from mixed sources.

TYPE LOCATION: Humboldt County, California; located approximately 100 meters (328 feet) east of Patrick's Point State Park; USGS Trinidad Quadrangle; WGS84 Decimal degrees 41.1278028 latitude and -124.1490389 longitude; UTM Zone 10 403550mE 4553581mN; NAD83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture: The soil is usually moist in all parts in the soil moisture control section in most years, but becomes nearly dry in the upper part from about September 15 to October 15 in most years. The soils have a udic soil moisture regime.

Soil temperature: The mean annual soil temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C (52 to 55 degrees F). The difference between mean summer and mean winter temperature is 2 to 4 degrees C. The soils have an isomesic soil temperature regime.

The umbric epipedon is 25 to 100 centimeters thick.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Tarquin soil. Tarquin soils are formed in colluvium and residuum derived from weakly consolidated siltstone and conglomerate. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cannonball soils are on nearly level to steep slopes of  dissected marine terraces on slopes of 0 to 50 percent. Elevations are 4 to 183 meters (10 to 600 feet). These soils formed in marine deposits derived from mixed sources. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 890 to 2085 millimeters (35 to 90 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C (50 to 53 degrees F). Frost free season is about 275 to 325 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Lepoil, Megwil, and Timmons soils which also occur on dissected marine terraces. Lepoil and Timmons soils lack redoximorphic features within the upper 100 centimeters. Megwil and Timmons soils occur under cultivated or cleared conditions where the difference between mean winter and mean summer soil temperature is 6 degrees C or greater.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: moderately well drained; low to medium runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for timber production and urban development. Natural vegetation includes redwood with scattered Sitka spruce and red alder, salal, western swordfern, redwood sorrel, and California huckleberry. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: California Coastal Redwood Belt; MLRA 4B. The series is not extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Humboldt and Del Norte Counties Soil Survey, Northern Part, California, January 2013. The name is from Cannonball Beach. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
1. Umbric epipedon - the zone from 2 to 29 centimeters (A horizons).
2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 45 to 173 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Btg1, Btg2, Btg3).
3. Particle-size control section - the zone from 45 to 95 centimeters averages 31 percent clay and 45 percent fine sand or coarser (Bt2 and Bt3 horizons)
