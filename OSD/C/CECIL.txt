SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Distribution: Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia
Extent: Large 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Cecil County, Maryland; 1899.

REMARKS: 
The June 1988 revision changed the classification to Typic Kanhapludults and recognized the low activity clay properties of this soil as defined in the Low Activity Clay Amendment to Soil Taxonomy, August 1986. The December 2005 revision changed the type location from Catawba County, North Carolina to a more representative location. The May 2006 revision changed language in competing series for Wedowee. The November 2025 revision changed the format. No data was changed.
REVISED--09/1997, RLV; 12/2005, DTA; 05/2006, RHB; 11/2025, DTA

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 20 centimeters (0 to 8 inches) (Ap horizon)
Argillic and kandic horizon--the zone from 20 to 107 centimeters (8 to 42 inches) has low activity clay in more than 50 percent of the horizon (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
