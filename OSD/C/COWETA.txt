COWETA SERIES

The Coweta series consists of shallow, well drained to somewhat excessively drained soils on interfluves and hillslopes. They formed in material weathered from residuum from sandstone inter-bedded with shale of Pennsylvanian age.  Slope ranges from 1 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1040 mm (41 inches).  Mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C. (61 degrees F.).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, siliceous, superactive, thermic, shallow Typic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Coweta loam--rangeland.   (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A--0 to 20 centimeters (0 to 8 inches); dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) loam, brown (7.5YR 5/2) dry; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable; many fine and medium roots; few sandstone fragments; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary.  [10 to 36 centimeters (4 to 14 inches) thick]

     Bw--20 to 38 centimeters (8 to 15 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) gravelly fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) dry; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable; common fine roots; 20 percent by volume of soft sandstone fragments less than 76 mm (3 inches) in diameter; 10 percent sandstone fragments 76 to 250 mm (3 to 10 inches) in diameter; moderately acid; abrupt wavy boundary.  (15 to 30 centimeters (6 to 12 inches) thick)

    Cr--38 to 76 centimeters (15 to 30 inches); strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) and yellowish red (5YR 5/8) soft sandstone interbedded with shale; strongly acid.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Coweta soils are on broad smooth upland ridges and on hillslopes on plains.  Slope ranges from 1 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in residuum weathered from soft sandstone interbedded with shale of Pennsylvanian age.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 890 to 1140 mm (35 to 45 inches).  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 14 to 18 degrees C. (57 to 64 degrees F.).  Frost free period is 170 to 235 days.  Elevation is 140 to 340 meters (459 to 1115 feet) above mean sea level.  Thornthwaite P-E index is 64 to 80.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bates, Collinsville, Dennis, Eram, Talihina, and Vinita soils.  Bates, Dennis, Eram, and Vinita soils are on lower slopes and they have an argillic horizon and a solum thicker than 51 centimeters (20 inches).  Collinsville soils have a lithic contact within 51 centimeters (20 inches).  Talihina soils have more than 35 percent clay content in the control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well to somewhat excessively drained.  Potential for surface runoff is medium to very high.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high (4 to 14 micrometers per second) or high (14 to 42 micrometers per second). 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Principal use is for rangeland.  Some areas are used for tame pasture on slopes less than 15 percent.  Small amounts are cultivated on slopes less than 5 percent.  Native vegetation is tall grass prairie.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  MLRAs 84A, 112, 117 and 118 in eastern Oklahoma, possibly southeastern Kansas and southwestern Missouri.  The type location is in MLRA 112.  The series is of moderate extent.
