CADOTTE SERIES

The Cadotte series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability above the sandy-skeletal material and rapid in the sandy-skeletal material.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Cadotte soils are used mainly for woodland and understory grazing.  Potential native vegetation is mainly lodgepole pine and Douglas fir with an understory of pinegrass, elk sedge, rough fescue, Idaho fescue, dwarf huckleberry, Oregon-grape, and other shrubs, forbs, and grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Cadotte soils are inextensive in the mountain valleys of western Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lewis and Clark County Area, Montana, 1991; proposed in Lewis and Clark County, Montana, 1988.  Cadotte is the name of a local creek.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT1160.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from 2 to 10 inches (A and Bt/A horizons); an argillic horizon from 10 to 25 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizon); and a sandy-skeletal 2Bk horizon below a depth of 34 inches.  The particle-size control section is the argillic horizon.  Cadotte soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
