COSBIE SERIES

The Cosbie series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils in drainageways on a lava plateau. These soils formed in grassy organic material over diatomaceous earth over alluvium from pumice over alluvium from basalt. Slopes are 1 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy over ashy or ashy-pumiceous, mixed over glassy, superactive, nonacid Aquandic Cryaquents 

TYPICAL PEDON: Cosbie supporting the lodgepole pine/widefruit sedge plant association on a 2 percent slope at 4875 feet. When described on 18 August 1999 the soil was wet throughout (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

(12 to 59 inches thick) 

  3Ab--51 to 75 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) gravelly sandy loam; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; very friable, non-sticky and slightly plastic; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape - lava plateau
Landform - drainageways
Elevation - 4575 to 5630 feet
Slope - 1 to 6 percent 
Parent material - grassy organic material over diatomaceous earth over alluvium from Mt. Mazama pumice over alluvium from basalt
Climate - cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers
Mean annual air temperature - 41 to 45 degrees F
Mean January air temperature - 25 to 27 degrees F
Mean July air temperature - 57 to 60 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation - 20 to 32 inches
Frost-free period - 5 to 35 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Lapine, Chinchallo and Chemult soils. Lapine soils are on adjacent plateaus and formed in volcanic ash and pumice, and are excessively drained. Chinchallo soils are on nearby flood plains and lake basins and have a layer of diatomaceous earth having an n Value of less than 0.7. Chemult soils are on nearby flood plains and have a histic epipedon. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage - very poorly drained
Permeability - very slow
Flooding - frequent
Ponding - frequent
Water table - an apparent high water table is at its uppermost limit from April to August 

USE AND VEGETATION: Cosbie soils are used for wildlife habitat, watershed and recreation. The potential natural plant community is the lodgepole pine/widefruit sedge plant association (CLM1-13). 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Klamath County, Oregon; MLRA 6. Series is of small extent.
