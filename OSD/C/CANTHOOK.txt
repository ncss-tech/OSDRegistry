CANTHOOK SERIES


The Canthook series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of loamy and sandy glaciofluvial or eolian deposits and the underlying silty to clayey glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on glacial lake plains. Slopes range from 2 to 6 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C. and the mean annual precipitation is about 700 millimeters. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aeric Albaqualfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Canthook sandy loam on a footslope of 5 percent slope in a wooded area on a glacial lake plain at an elevation of about 408 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

(Combined thickness of the 2Bt horizon ranges 10 to 60 centimeters)

 2BC--97 to 137 centimeters; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) silty clay loam; massive; firm; common medium distinct irregular brownish yellow (10YR 6/6), masses of oxidized iron and many medium distinct irregular gray (2.5Y 6/1) iron depletions throughout; strongly effervescent; contains a few thin varves of dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) silty clay (less than 10 percent of the horizon); slightly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 50 centimeters thick)

 2C--137 to 203 centimeters; 80 percent light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) and 20 percent dark gray (2.5Y 4/1) stratified silty clay loam to silty clay; massive; firm; few fine threadlike very weakly cemented light gray (2.5Y 7/1) carbonate masses and few fine spherical strongly cemented light gray (2.5Y 7/1) carbonate concretions throughout; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline; the dark gray materials are silty clay varves 1/2 to 1 centimeter thick.
