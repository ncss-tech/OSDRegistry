CABLON SERIES

The Cablon series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in outwash derived mainly from granite, gneiss, and sedimentary rock.  Cablon soils are on outwash terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed Ustic Calcicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cablon sandy loam - on a 1 percent slope in an area of native grassland at an elevation of 9,070 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) Described on May 31, 1988.
