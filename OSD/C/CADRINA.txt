CADRINA SERIES

The Cadrina series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from shale and sandstone.  Cadrina soils are on hillslopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Lithic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cadrina extremely stony loam, on a east facing, 35 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 5,200 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    The surface is covered by 10 percent stones, 10 percent flagstones, 40 percent channers.

    A--0 to 2 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely stony loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate thin platy structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine vesicular pores; 5 percent stones, 5 percent flagstones, 15 percent gravel, 10 percent channers; slightly effervescent, (4 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick)

    Bk--2 to 15 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely stony loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine, few medium roots; common very fine, few fine tubular pores; 20 percent stones, 15 percent flagstones, 40 percent channers; slightly effervescent, (6 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated and segregated as less than 1 mm thick coatings on undersides of rock fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (5 to 18 inches thick)

    R--15 inches; fractured sandstone bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Uintah County, Utah; about 1 mile northeast of the mouth of Saddlehorse Draw and the White River; located about 2,000 feet north and 2,100 feet east of the southwest corner of sec. 17, T. 10 S., R. 23 E. SLBM; Asphalt Wash USGS quad; lat. 39 degrees 56 minutes 52 seconds N. and long. 109 degrees 21 minutes 3 seconds W., NAD 27

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture:  The soil moisture control section is affected by precipitation that falls evenly through the year with a slight increase in late summer and fall.  Typic aridic moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature:  47 to 50 degrees F.
Depth to secondary calcium carbonate:  1 to 4 inches
Depth to lithic contact:  5 to 20 inches to sandstone or shale bedrock

Particle-size control section:  18 to 27 percent clay and 35 to 90 percent rock fragments (consisting of channers, flagstones, and stones from sandstone and shale)

A horizon:
Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y
Value:  5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma:  2 to 4 dry or moist
Texture (fine earth):  loam
Rock fragments:  60 to 80 percent channers, flagstones, and stones.
Reaction:  moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline

Bk horizon:
Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y
Value:  5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma:  2 to 4 dry or moist
Texture (fine earth):  loam
Rock fragments:  35 to 90 percent (consisting of channers, flagstones, and stones)
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  3 to 15 percent
Gypsum:  0 to 1 percent
Reaction:  moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline

COMPETING SERIES:  Current competitors are the Pintwater, Singatse, and Sojur series.  Competitors prior to the Eighth Edition, 1998 Keys to Soil Taxonomy are the Berzatic, Blacktop, and Tsaya series.

Berzatic, Blacktop, Pintwater, Sojur, and Tsaya:  have soil moisture control sections that are affected by a xeric precipitation pattern and have mean annual soil temperatures greater than 50 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from sandstone and shale
Landform:  hillslopes
Slopes:  2 to 50 percent
Elevation: 4,700 to 6,600 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  45 to 47 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  5 to 8 inches.
Frost-free period:  110 to 125 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ioka, Casmos, Gilston, Muff, and Walknolls series.  

Ioka soils have bedrock at greater than 20 inches in depth and are sandy-skeletal. 

Casmos soils have less than 35 percent rocks fragments in the particle-size control section.

Gilston soils occur on alluvial fans and toeslopes, are deeper than 20 inches, and have less than 35 percent rocks in the particle-size control section.

Muff soils occur on fan remnants, are deep than 20 inches, and have less than 35 percent rocks in the particle-size control section, and has a natric horizon.

Walknolls soils have a calcic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, high runoff, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally for rangeland, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  Potential native vegetation consists of black sagebrush, shadscale, Utah greasebush, and bottlebrush squirreltail.  These soils are correlated to Desert Shallow Loam (Black Sagebrush) - 034XY118UT, Desert Shallow Loam (Shadscale) - 034XY121UT, and Desert Shaly Shallow Loam (Utah Greasebush) - 034XY131UT range sites in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Utah.  LRR D, MLRA 34.  This series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Uintah County, Uintah Area Soil Survey, Utah. 1998.  The name is coined.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 15 inches.  (Bk horizon)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 2 inches.  (A horizon)
Secondary calcium carbonate:  The zone from 2 to 15 inches.  (Bk horizon)
Lithic contact:  The contact with sandstone bedrock at 15 inches.  (R layer)

The cation exchange activity class was inferred from laboratory data from similar soils in the Uintah Area Soil Survey.

The surface texture modifier was determined following the guidelines outlined in the Utah document, "Procedures for Distributing Rock Fragments on the Surface Layer into the Upper 6 inches of Soil and Subsequent Naming of Map Units, April 1979."
