CANTINA SERIES

The Cantina series consists of deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium.  Cantina soils are on intra-lava ridge valleys and lower part of hills.  Slopes are 1 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cantina sandy loam--woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

   A--0 to 2 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few coarse and common very fine roots; many fine vesicular pores; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 4 inches thick)

   Bt1--2 to 9 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few coarse and common very fine roots; common very fine tubular and irregular pores; common moderately thick clay films on faces of peds and in pores; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary.  (5 to 7 inches thick)

   Bt2--9 to 16 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) sandy clay, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few coarse and common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; many moderately thick clay films on faces of peds and in pores; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

   Bt3--16 to 24 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few coarse and common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; many moderately thick clay films on faces of peds and in pores; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 9 inches thick)

   Btk--24 to 31 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, sticky and plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common moderately thick clay films on faces of peds and in pores; strongly effervescent; calcium carbonate is disseminated and in few medium irregular soft masses; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 8 inches thick)

       Bk--31 to 54 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy clay loam, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; strongly effervescent; lime is disseminated and in few medium irregular soft masses; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (18 to 40 inches thick)

	2R--54 inches; basalt.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Abrazo (NM), Carnero (NM), Celsospring (NM), Charette (NM), Concho (NM), Cueva (NM), Remunda (NM) and Philmont (NM) series.  Abrazo, Carnero and Cueva soils have bedrock between 20 and 40 inches.  Celsospring soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the Bt.  Charette soils are noncalcareous to a depth of 51 inches.  Concho soils have calcic horizons.  Remunda and Philmont soils have less than 30 percent sand in the Bt horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cantina soils are on lower basalt hills and intra-basalt ridge valleys.  Slopes are 1 to 3 percent.  Elevations range from 7,100 to 7,700 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Atarque, Cabezon, Catman, Flugle, Galestina, Goesling, Millpaw, Nogal, Pinitos, Ribera, Silkie and Teco series.  Atarque and Cabezon soils have bedrock at less than 20 inches.  Millpaw soils have a pachic epipedon.  Teco, Nogal, Galestina, Pinitos, Ribera, Catman, Silkie, Flugle, Goesling soils do not have mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Cantina soils are used for fuelwood and livestock grazing.  Present vegetation in pinyon pine, oneseed juniper, blue grama, sideoats grama, pinyon ricegrass and rubber rabbitbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The series is of small extent in west central New Mexico. MLRA 35.
