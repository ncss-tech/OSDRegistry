CHENEY SERIES

The Cheney series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in sandy and gravelly glaciofluvial deposits mixed with loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. These soils are on nearly level to steep outwash plains. The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Vitrandic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Cheney ashy silt loam - cultivated. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

(0 to 4 inches thick)

	2C2--32 to 60 inches; variegated extremely gravelly coarse sand; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 70 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, dominantly basalt, few granite and quartzite fragments; few faint carbonate coatings on undersides of some gravel and cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Haley series. Haley soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the particle-size control section, and are dry for 90 to 105 consecutive days.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cheney soils are on outwash plains and terraces at elevations of 1,800 to 3,000 feet. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The soils formed in sandy and gravelly glaciofluvial deposits mixed with loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The average annual precipitation is 15 to 20 inches. The average annual temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free period is 110 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alecanyon, Battleplain, Tucannon, and Uhlig soils. Alecanyon soils do not have a contrasting particle-size class and are sandy-skeletal throughout. Battleplain and Uhlig soils do not have contrasting textures and are on terraces or outwash plains. Tucannon soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches and are on benches and plateaus of channeled scabland.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate permeability to a depth of about 32 inches and very rapid below.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for native range, small grains, peas, alfalfa and grass. Potential natural vegetation is Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, rose, threetip sagebrush,, and in places widely spaced ponderosa pine trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Washington; MLRA 9. Series is of moderate extent.

The description reflects a change in classification as of 5/2000 from coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Typic Haploxerolls to coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Vitrandic Haploxerolls based on revisions to Soil Taxonomy.
