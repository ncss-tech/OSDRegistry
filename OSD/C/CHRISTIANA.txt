REMARKS: 

Reclassification of Christiana series from fine, kaolinitic, mesic Typic Paleudults to fine, kaolinitic, mesic Aquic Hapludults, is proposed as a result of field studies in conjunction with soil survey updates in Maryland that indicate areas mapped Christiana are predominantly moderately well drained Aquic Hapludults.
