COLLISTER SERIES


The Collister series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils with moderate permeability that formed in alluvium from mixed sediments and igneous rocks. Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent in valleys. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

Birdow soils are calcareous to the soil surface and have a xeric soil moisture regime. Blackrock soils are well drained, contain 20 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section, and have a Bk horizon. Coit soils are poorly drained and calcareous throughout. Dagor soils have a xeric soil moisture regime, are well drained, and have a solum less than 26 inches thick. Eastcan soils are calcareous throughout, have a xeric soil moisture regime, and mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 51 degrees F. Goose Creek soils are calcareous in some part of the control section. Goosenawt soils have mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 51 degrees F, are mildly or moderately alkaline, and do not have redoximorphic concentrations. Gosinta soils have a solum less than 40 inches thick. Heidtman soils have a calcareous horizon in the control section with SAR of 13 to 30. Lakeview soils do not have redoximorphic features, are somewhat poorly drained, have a solum less than 40 inches thick, and have 2Btb horizons. Monroe soils are well drained, are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline in the control section and do not have Bg horizons. Oxy soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact. Shoepeg soils are somewhat poorly drained and have a solum less than 40 inches thick. Soquel soils have average annual soil temperature of 56 to 58 degrees F., a solum less than 40 inches thick and buried A horizons. Willowdale soils have Ak horizons, are calcareous throughout, and have 10 to 20 percent pumice sands. Winn soils are somewhat poorly drained and slightly or moderately alkaline throughout. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Collister soils are on upper flood-plain steps at elevations of 2,700 to 3,750 feet. Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from mixed sediments (Tertiary) and igneous rocks. The average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches. The average annual temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Flofeather soils. Flofeather soils are coarse-loamy, somewhat excessively drained and occur on the same landform as the Collister soils. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained with a seasonal high water table from 40 to 70 inches during the months of March through June; slow runoff; moderate permeability. Collister soils are subject to rare flooding for brief periods in December through May. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Collister soils are used mainly for irrigated hayland/pasture. Small areas are used for rangeland and homesites. Native vegetation is basin big sagebrush and basin wildrye. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwestern and west-central, Idaho. 
MLRA 10 and 11. Collister soils are of small extent.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
Mollic epipedon - zone from the surface to 58 inches (Ap1, Ap2, A1, A2 Bw1, Bw2, Bw3, and Bw4 horizons)
Particle-size control section - zone from 10 to 40 inches 
Redoximorphic features - zone from 28 to 68 inches (Bw2, Bw3, Bw4 and C horizons) 
Redox concentrations in the upper part of this zone are relict features. The landscape has had significant drainage entrenchment and lowering of the water table.
Soil moisture regime - aridic bordering on xeric
 
These soils are drier than other Xerolls in the region under similar precipitation due to early runoff and extended period of high evapotranspiration.
