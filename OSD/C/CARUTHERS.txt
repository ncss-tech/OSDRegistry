CARUTHERS SERIES

The Caruthers series consists of deep to a hardpan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from igneous and sedimentary rock. The Caruthers soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 1 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 175 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Rotura (NM) series. Rotura soils have a calcic horizon over an indurated petrocalcic horizon and occur on board basin floors. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Caruthers soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 1 to 4 percent. The soils formed in alluvium derived from igneous and sedimentary rock. Elevation ranges from 1060 to 1400 meters. The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm. The mean annual air temperature is about 15 to 18 degrees C. The frost-free period is 210 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Castaneda and Helendale series. The Castaneda and Helendale soils are on similar landforms. Castaneda soils are moderately deep to a petrocalcic horizon and have a fine-loamy particle-size control section. Helendale soils do not have a hardpan. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; low runoff; moderate saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Caruthers soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is Cooper's goldenbush, big galleta, Nevada ephedra and Joshua tree. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Basin and Range of California, U.S.A.; MLRA 30. The series is of moderate extent.
