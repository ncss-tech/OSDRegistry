CLAYBURN SERIES

The Clayburn series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial drift, colluvium, or alluvium derived mainly from shale, sandstone, and andesite, with some basalt.  Clayburn soils are on plateaus, hills, and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Wasatch County (Wasatch Area), Utah, 1971.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon (Pachic feature):  the zone from the surface to 41 inches.  (A1, A2, A3, BA, Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Argillic horizon:  the zone from 24 to 41 inches.  (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Particle size control section:  The zone from 24 to 41 inches.  (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)

In Utah this series is correlated with High Mountain range sites.

This revision refines the concept of this series to a udic moisture regime that borders on xeric. This more accurately reflects the moisture regime and vegetation at the type location.

Keys to Soil Taxonomy:  Classified according to the Eighth Edition, 1998

Activity class is presumed based on general trend of other soils in the area.
