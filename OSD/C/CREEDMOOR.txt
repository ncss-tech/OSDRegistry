SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Distribution: North Carolina, Virginia, and possibly South Carolina 
Extent: Extensive

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Prince Edward County, Virginia; 1950.

REMARKS: Horizon depths were modified 10/2021 to make certain soil description began at soil surface.
The September 2025 revision reformatted the description to semi-tabular. No data was changed. In September 2025, the typical pedon was moved to Granville County, North Carolina.  The site in Durham County, North Carolina was covered by an industrial park.

Diagnostic features and horizons recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--The zone from 0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches) (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--The zone from 18 to 132 centimeters (7 to 52 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)
Aquic feature--Iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less occurring in the 51 to 76 centimeters (20 to 30 inch) subhorizon.
