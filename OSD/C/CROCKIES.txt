CROCKIES SERIES

The Crockies series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed volcanic ash and loess over residuum from basalt. Crockies soils are on lava plateaus. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Durinodic Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON: Crockies ashy very fine sandy loam, rangeland at an elevation of 1,263 meters. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is partly covered by 20 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles and 1 percent stones.

(combined thickness of the Bkq2 and Bkq3 horizons is 50 to 85 cm)

	Bkq3--80 to 115 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly ashy fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, firm, nonsticky, nonplastic; 20 percent basalt gravel; 5 percent weakly cemented durinodes; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Broyles, Gardenvalley, Keefa, Strike, and Weso soils. All these soils are greater than 152 cm to bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Crockies soils are on lava plateaus in small depressions. These soils formed in mixed volcanic ash and loess over residuum weathered from basalt. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Elevations are 1,200 to 1,280 meters. The climate is arid and characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Igert soils. Igert soils are less than 100 cm to bedrock.
