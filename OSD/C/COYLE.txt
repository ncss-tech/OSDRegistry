COYLE SERIES

The Coyle series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone of Permian age.  These soils are on crests and side slopes of low hills in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 15.6 degrees C (60 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 910 mm (36 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, siliceous, active, thermic Udic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Coyle loam-rangeland, on a 2 percent slope, at an elevation of 305 m (1000 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

   A--0 to 28 cm (0 to 11 in); dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2) loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) moist; strong fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable; many fine roots; slightly acid, clear smooth boundary.  (Thickness of the A horizon is 18 to 36 cm [7 to 14 in])

   BA--28 to 36 cm (11 to 14 in); reddish brown (5YR 4/3) loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable; many fine roots; many fine pores; many worm casts; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. (Thickness of the BA horizon is 0 to 20 cm [0 to 8 in])

   Bt1--36 to 79 cm (14 to 31 in); red (2.5YR 5/6) clay loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; common fine roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.

   Bt2--79 to 99 cm (31 to 39 in); light red (2.5YR 6/8) sandy clay loam, red (2.5YR 5/8) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; common fine roots; few coarse fragments of sandstone less than 76 mm in diameter; few distinct clay films on faces of peds; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 15 to 76 cm [6 to 30 in])

   Cr--99 to 107 cm (39 to 42 in); red (2.5YR 5/6) sandstone; can be augured when moist; neutral.
