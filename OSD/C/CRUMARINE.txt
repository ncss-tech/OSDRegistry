CRUMARINE SERIES

The Crumarine series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from granite and loess. Crumarine soils are on narrow valley floors. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 31 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The soils are on floodplains and drainageways. Slope is 0 to 8 percent. Elevation is 1,100 to 3,300 feet (335 to 1006 meters). The soils formed in mixed alluvium. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 23 to 41 inches (584 to 1041 mm). The average annual air temperature is 40 to 46 degrees F. The frost-free period ranges from 80 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Threebear, Santa, and Quinnamose soils. Threebear soils are moderately well drained soils on plateaus with a thick mantle of volcanic ash Santa soils are moderately well drained soils on plateaus and are formed in mixed volcanic ash and loess. In addition Threebear and Santa soils have a fragipan.  Quinnamose soils are on mountain slopes and are formed in mixed volcanic ash and residuum from granite.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity; Depth to an apparent water table is 6 to 47 inches (15 to 119 cm) - January through June; subject to rare brief flooding from January through May.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for hayland, pasture land, and cropland.  Native vegetation is tufted hairgrass, columbia needlegrass, mountain brome, common camas, sedges and rushes.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North central Idaho. The series is of moderate extent.  MLRA 9 and 43A.

The 8/2008 description reflects an update in classification from Coarse-loamy, mixed, active, nonacid, frigid Aquic Xerofluvents To Coarse-loamy, isotic, frigid Aquandic Haploxerepts based on re-visiting the original type location and evaluating the original pedon description at the type location.
