CUSHING SERIES

The Cushing series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy calcareous till on ground moraines.  These soils have moderate permeability in the solum and moderately slow in the underlying till.  Slopes range from 20 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Haplic Glossudalfs

(Combined thickness of the B/E horizons is 4 to 20 inches thick)

  Bt--33 to 57 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) loam; strong medium prismatic parting to moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few very fine fibrous roots; few very fine tubular pores; many distinct brown (7.5YR 4/3) clay films on faces of peds; brown (10YR 5/3) sand skeletons on prism faces; 3 percent gravel; few fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulations; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 28 inches thick)

  Btk--57 to 65 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) fine sandy loam; strong coarse prismatic parting to strong medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few very fine fibrous roots; few prominent brown (7.5YR 4/3) clay films on faces of peds; 3 percent gravel; few fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulations; few fine light gray (10YR 7/2) soft masses of calcium carbonates; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 15 inches thick)

  Bk--65 to 73 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) fine sandy loam; strong coarse prismatic structure; friable; few very fine fibrous roots; 3 percent gravel; many medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulations; common fine light gray (10YR 7/2) masses of calcium carbonates; moderately effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 20 inches thick)

  BC--73 to 85 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) fine sandy loam; massive structure; friable; 3 percent gravel; many coarse prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulations and few fine gray (7.5YR 6/1) iron depletions; many medium fine light gray (10YR 7/2) masses of calcium carbonates; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Burnett County, Wisconsin; about 10 miles southeast of Grantsburg, WI.; 1450 feet south and 2230 feet west of the northeast corner of sec. 33, T. 37 N., R. 18 W.; Trade Lake USGS quadrangle; lat. 45 degrees 39 minutes 13 seconds N. and long. 92 degrees 36 minutes 1 seconds W.; NAD27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the base of the argillic is 40 to 70 inches. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 throughout. Reaction in the soil ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline.

The Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Low value and chroma are typical of the A horizon. The Ap or A horizon is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or silt loam.  Severely eroded phases are sandy clay loam or clay loam.

The E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Dry value is 7 or more.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.

Cushing soils have E/B or B/E horizons, or both.  These horizons have tongues of E material surrounding thin, columnlike upward extensions of Bt material or wholly surrounding small isolated remnants of Bt horizon.  The E part is like the E horizon and the Bt part is like the Bt horizon.

The Bt horizons have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 to 5.  They are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  Some pedons have BC horizons with color and texture similar to the Bt horizon.

The Btk and Bk horizons are similar in color and texture to the overlaying Bt horizons.  They are effervescent and  have masses of calcium carbonates apparent.

The BC horizon typically has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y,  value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Less commonly, it has hue of 7.5YR or 2.5Y. It is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  Some pedons have distinct or prominent high and low chroma mottles at depths between 30 and 85 inches.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Duluth, Fenwood, Greatscott, Rozellville, Sol, Warba and Watton series.  The Duluth, Fenwood, Greatscott, Rozellville, Sol, Warba and Watton series do not have a calcic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Parent material: loamy calcareous till 
Landform: ground moraines 
Slope:  20 to 35 percent
Elevation:  670 to 1450 feet
Mean annual temperature:  37 to 45 degrees F 
Mean annual precipitation:  24 to 34 inches 
Frost-free period: short 17 days and long 159 days; median 89 to 130 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Alstad, Bluffton, and Branstad series. The somewhat poorly drained Alstad, the very poorly drained Bluffton, and the moderately well drained Branstad soils form the drainage sequence with the Cushing soils.  In places, a moderately wet phase of Cushing is also associated.  The depth to saturation on this phase is 40 to 60 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Surface runoff is medium.  Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderately slow in the underlying till. Saturation typically occurs below 60 inches in April and May.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas have been cleared and are being used for general farming and pasture.  Corn, small grains, and forages are the major crops grown.  Native vegetation  is grass, mixed deciduous and coniferous forests with northern red oak, maple, elm, American basswood, eastern white pine, and red pine predominating.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Wisconsin and parts of east- central Minnesota.  These soils are moderately extensive.
