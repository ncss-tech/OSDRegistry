COMBSFLAT SERIES

The Combsflat series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash over colluvium from rhyolite and basalt.  Combsflat soils are in depressions and on benches on mountains and hills.  Slopes are 5 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.   

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  ashy over clayey, glassy over smectitic, frigid Alfic Humic Vitrixerands

TYPICAL PEDON:  Combsflat ashy sandy loam -upland forest, on a 20 percent concave east facing slope at elevation of 5,300 feet located in the Maury Mountains, Crook County, Oregon.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

        Oi--0 to 1 inch, slightly decomposed forest litter

        A1--1 to 5 inches, dark brown (10YR 3/3) ashy sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; strong thin to medium platy structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine vesicular pores; 5 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  

        A2--5 to 16 inches, dark brown (10YR 3/3) ashy sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and non-plastic; many very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of A horizons is 14 to 20 inches.)

        2Btb2--30 to 50 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly sandy clay,  dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine and medium prismatic structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky, and moderately plastic; common very fine to medium roots; many very fine to fine irregular and tubular pores; many distinct clay films on ped faces and in pores; 30 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of 2Btb horizon is 30 to 50 inches)

        2BC--50 to 61 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) extremely cobbly sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine to medium roots; few very fine and fine irregular and tubular pores; 25 percent gravel, 25 percent cobble and 10 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.4).
