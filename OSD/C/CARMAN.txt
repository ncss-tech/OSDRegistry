CARMAN SERIES

The Carman series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderate to moderately slowly permeable soils formed in calcareous, loamy, old alluvium of Pleistocene age.  These soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping areas of old stream terraces along the western side of the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A).  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 69 mm (27 in), and the mean annual temperature is 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).

Waynoka soils: have a lithologic discontinuity between 76 to 152 cm (30 and 60 in)

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: formed in calcareous, loamy, old alluvium

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Devol, Eda, Ruella, and Waynoka series. 
Devol and Eda soils: are found on higher areas, are less clayey, do not have carbonates within 91 cm (36 in), and do not have a mollic epipedon  
Ruella soils: are on slightly higher areas, do not have an argillic horizon or mollic epipedon  
Waynoka soils: are on similar areas, do not have carbonates within 76 cm (30 in), and have a lithologic discontinuity within the profile

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage: moderately well drained
Permeability: moderate to moderately slow 
Runoff: negligible to very low 
Water table: A perched water table ranges in depth from 40 to 60 inches from January through June. Much of this water comes as seepage from surrounding higher areas.

USE AND VEGETATION: Carman soils are used mainly for cropland, but a few areas are used as native range or tame pasture.  Native vegetation is tall and mid grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: LRR-H; Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA-80A) of North-central Oklahoma and South-central Kansas.  The series is not extensive.
