MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Paulding County, GA, 2010 

REMARKS: After further review, since the Btss is 10 inches thick with a total depth of 25 inches, the aquertic (vertic properties, aquic) subgroup has been changed to albaquultic (abrupt textural change, base saturation between 35 and 60 percent, aquic) Very-high shrink-swell has been changed to high in the Btss.03/06. This series was formerly included with the Orange, Pittsboro, Sedgefield, Wilkes, and Wynott soils. Orange soils have smectitic minerology, paralithic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches, and are in the mesic soil temperature regime. Pittsboro soils do not have redoximorphic depletions of chroma 2 or less in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon. Wilkes soils are well drained, and have paralithic contact at a depth of 10 to 20 inches. Wynott soils are well drained.  The April 2007 only changed the status of this soil back to tentative.  This soil was never correlated in Virginia.  The 2012 change decreases the requirement of coarse fragments in the lower horizons.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 7 inches (A and E horizons)
Argillic horizon - the zone from 7 to 21 inches (Bt horizon)
Aquic conditions - the soil has redoxomorphic depletions and concentrations within the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon, with periodic saturation and reduction at some time during the year
Paralithic contact - the occurrence of weathered bedrock at a depth of 25 inches (upper boundary of the Cr horizon)
