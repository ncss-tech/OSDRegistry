CHIVATO SERIES

The Chivato series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in lacustrine materials derived from basalt. Chivato soils are in playas on lava plateaus. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, frigid Typic Haplusterts

TYPICAL PEDON: Chivato clay--in rangeland on a concave surface of less than 1 percent slope at an elevation of 8,400 feet. (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.)

     A--0 to 2 inches; gray (5Y 5/1) clay, very dark gray (5Y 3/1) moist; moderate medium platy structure parting to moderate very fine and fine granular; slightly hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; few (<1 percent) cobble and stone sized volcanic bombs occur on the surface; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 3 inches thick)

    Bss1--2 to 13 inches; gray (5Y 5/1) clay, very dark gray (5Y 3/1) moist; weak medium and coarse angular blocky structure; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; many pressure faces; few slickensides; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.

    Bss2--13 to 40 inches; gray (5Y 5/1) clay, very dark gray (5Y 3/1) moist; massive; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; many pressure faces; many slickensides; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.

    Bssg--52 to 65 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; many pressure faces; few slickensides; common fine distinct reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8) moist redox concentrations and dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist redox depletions; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4). (The combined thickness of the B horizons is 58 to 81 inches)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competitors.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Chivato soils formed in lacustrine materials derived from basalt associated with Quaternary and Tertiary basaltic flows in the Mount Taylor volcanic field. Chivato soils are in depressions and playas on lava plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. Elevations range from 8,100 to 8,600 feet. The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches. The frost free period is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Apark and Canoneros soils on lava plateaus and cinder cones; and the Seco soils on valley floors. The Apark soils have less than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section and lack vertic properties. The Canoneros soils are shallow to a lithic contact with basalt. The Seco soils have an argillic horizon and do not crack to the surface.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained, negligible runoff, and very slow permeability. Occasional brief ponding.

USE AND VEGETATION: This series is used for rangeland. Present vegetation is western wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West central, New Mexico. MLRA 35 & 39, LRR-D This series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Rio Puerco Reconnaissance Survey, 1940.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Vertic properties: Gilgai microrelief ranges up to 6 inches. Cracks are 0.5 inches in width, and range from the surface to 30 inches or more in depth. Slickensides are few to common from 2 to 30 inches or more.

The type location moved to McKinley Co., NM in 1994. This soil was reclassified based on lab data in April 2001. 

Classified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999.
