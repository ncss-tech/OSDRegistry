CHIARA SERIES

The Chiara series consists of shallow to duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a loess mantle high in volcanic ash. The Chiara soils are on summits shoulders and side slopes of fan remnants and plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Vitrixerandic Haplodurids

TYPICAL PEDON: Chiara ashy silt loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(0 to 23 cm thick) 

  Bqk--20 to 33 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) ashy silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and medium roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; many 0.8 cm in diameter very hard and very firm brittle durinodes; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (10 to 36 cm thick) 

  2Bqkm--33 to 53 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) indurated duripan with continuous, very thin (less than 3 mm) pale brown (10YR 6/3) silica laminae, pale brown (10YR 6/3) and dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; extremely hard, extremely firm, few very fine interstitial pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8).

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in winter and spring, dry from summer and fall; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric. 
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 12 degrees C. 
Depth to duripan: 25 to 50 cm. 
Depth to carbonates: 10 to 38 cm. 

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 5 to 18 percent.

Durinodes: Contains from 20 to 60 percent weakly cemented and brittle durinodes from 0.8 to 3 cm in diameter. 
Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline. 
Volcanic glass: Volcanic glass is estimated to range from 20 to 30 percent of the 0.2 to 2 mm fraction.

Bqkm horizon
Value: 6 through 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist. 
Chroma: 2 through 4.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chiara soils are summits, shoulders and side slopes fan remnants and plateaus. These soils formed in a loess mantle high in volcanic ash over alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent, but dominantly 2 to 15 percent. Elevations are 1,100 to 2,130 meters. The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 90 to 120 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are The Brock, Cherry Spring and Cortez soils. These soils have argillic horizons. Cherry Spring and Cortez soils have duripans below 50 cm. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; slow or medium runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, Sandberg bluegrass and cheatgrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North-central and northeastern Nevada. MLRA 24, 25. Chiara soils are not extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Pershing County, Nevada (BLM Sonoma Planning Unit) 1974. 

REMARKS: Reclassified from Xeric Haplodurids to Vitrixerandic Haplodurids to meet current taxonomy. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the surface to 18 cm (A horizon). 
Vitrixerandic feature: Volcanic glass is estimated to be 20 to 40 percent of the 0.02 to 2 mm fraction in the zone from the soil surface to 20 cm (A and Bw horizons) and 20 to 30 percent of the 0.02 to 2 mm fraction in the zone from 20 to 33 cm (Bqk horizon). Meets organic carbon and soil moisture regime requirement for xeric. 
Indurated duripan - The zone from 33 to 53 cm (2Bqkm horizon.) 
Particle-size control section - The zone from the soil surface to 33 cm (A, Bw and Bqk horizons).
