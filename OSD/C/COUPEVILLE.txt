COUPEVILLE SERIES

The Coupeville series consists of deep, poorly drained soils formed in glacial drift over dense glaciomarine deposits. Coupeville soils are in drainageways and valleys of glacial drift plains and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Toko series. Toko soils are very deep and have a mollic epipedon 38 to 102 cm thick.
 
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Coupeville soils are in drainageways and valleys of glacial drift plains. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. These soils formed in glacial drift overlying dense glaciomarine deposits. Elevation ranges from 0 to 90 meters. The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and mild moist winters. Annual precipitation ranges from 455 to 1,015 millimeters. Average annual temperature ranges from 9 to 10 degrees C. The frost-free period is about 200 to 240 days.
 
GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Coveland, Sucia, and Shalcar soils. Coveland soils have an ochric epipedon and do not have redoximorphic features above 20 cm. Sucia soils have an ochric epipedon and do not have redoximorphic features above 46 cm. Shalcar soils have a histic epipedon.
 
DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the upper part (A and E horizons) and moderately low to low in the lower part (Btg and Cd horizons). Coupeville soils have a perched water table as high as 0 cm from October to April, 25 cm in May, and 60 cm in June, unless the soil is drained. Coupeville soils are subject to frequent ponding for very long durations from December to March and for brief durations during October, November, and April.
 
USE AND VEGETATION: Coupeville soils are used for crop production, forage crop production, livestock grazing, and wildlife habitat. Wheat, oats, barley, alfalfa and vegetables for produce and for seed are common crops. Potential natural vegetation consists of Sitka spruce, red alder, lodgepole pine, clustered rose, salmonberry, trailing blackberry, red elderberry, common snowberry, stinging nettle, swordfern, slough sedge, field horsetail, and scouring-rush horsetail.
 
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Puget Sound valleys in Northwest Washington; 
MLRA A2, Northern Part. Series is of small extent.
 
MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon
 
SERIES ESTABLISHED: Island County, Washington 1950. The name is taken from the town of Coupeville on Whidbey Island.
 
REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:

Mollic epipedon - 0 to 30 cm (A horizons)
Albic horizon - 30 to 51 cm (E horizon)
Argillic horizon - 51 to 127 cm (Btg horizons)
Densic contact - 127 cm (upper boundary of Cd horizon)
Particle-size control section - the zone from 51 to 101 cm (upper 50 cm of the argillic horizon)
Depth to redoximorphic features - 18 cm (depleted matrix with a chroma of 2 or less and iron-manganese masses)
 
This revision (5/2006) includes a change in classification and typical pedon based on field investigations. The previous classification was fine-loamy over clayey, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Epiaquolls, which did not recognize the albic, argillic, nor densic horizons now described in the field. The previous pedon location was uncertain within a square mile.
