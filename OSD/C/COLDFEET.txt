COLDFEET SERIES

The Coldfeet series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from sandstone and quartzite.  Coldfeet soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 12 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 0.8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Mollic Haplocryalfs  

TYPICAL PEDON:  Coldfeet gravelly loam, on a north facing, linear, 30 percent slope in forest at an elevation of 2,341 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  

 Oi--0 to 3 cm; slightly decomposed plant material, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2); abrupt smooth boundary.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Game(T)(ID) and Mikesell series.  The Game soils have a mollic epipedon and are on linear to convex northwest facing slopes.  The Mikesell soils have a fine particle size class and are on linear positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, high runoff, moderate permeability in the upper part and slow permeability in the lower part. 

USE AND VEGETATION: The major uses are wood products and some livestock grazing.  The native plant community is subalpine fir and lodgepole pine with an understory of huckleberry, spirea, mountain arnica, and pine grass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Coldfeet soils are of small extent in southeastern Idaho and western Wyoming, MLRA 43B.
