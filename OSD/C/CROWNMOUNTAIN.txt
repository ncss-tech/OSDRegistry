CROWNMOUNTAIN SERIES 

The Crownmountain series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in slide deposits and colluvium derived from mixed sedimentary rock sources. These soils occur on landslides, depressions, and mountain slopes. Slopes are 8 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive Oxyaquic Argicryolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Crownmountain silt loam, in forest on a 10 percent slope at an elevation of 1765 meters (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

 Oi--0 to 5 cm; undecomposed and partially decomposed matted roots; abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 10 cm thick) 

 A--5 to 31 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many fine and very fine dendritic tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (25 to 40 cm thick)

 Bt1--31 to 60 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong coarse subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine and medium roots; common fine irregular pores; 45 percent distinct clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary. 

 Bt2--60 to 76 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common fine irregular pores; 55 percent prominent clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent distinct medium irregular, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation; slightly acid (pH 6.4) clear wavy boundary. (combined thickness of Bt horizons - 35 to 55 cm thick)

 BC--76 to 150 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; strong coarse subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; 15 percent distinct medium irregular, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation; slightly acid (pH 6.4).
