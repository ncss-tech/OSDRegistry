COWLOW SERIES

The Cowlow series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and residuum from red sandstone or red siltstone, yellow sandstone or siltstone or gray siltstone.  Cowlow soils are on mountain backslopes.  Slopes are 10 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.

Frost-free season:  50 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chokecherry(T), Mahogany(T), Monida, Taylow(T), Transtrum(T) and Tubbs Hollow(T) soils.  Chokecherry soils occur on similar or higher landscape positions and are shallow to bedrock.  Mahogany soils occur on similar or lower landscape positions and have a fine-loamy particle size.  Monida soils occur on similar or higher landscape positions, are very deep and have a fine-loamy particle size.  Taylow soils occur on higher landscape positions and are shallow to bedrock.  Transtrum soils occur on similar or lower landscape positions, are very deep and have a fine particle size.  Tubbs Hollow soils occur on similar landscape positions and lack a mollic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to high surface runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Cowlow soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, Wyoming big sage, low sage, bluebunch wheatgrass, rabbitbrush, antelope bitterbrush, serviceberry, snowberry, arrowleaf balsamroot and a  few Rocky Mountain juniper. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho.  These soils are of small extent.
