CANBURN SERIES

The Canburn series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  Canburn soils are on alluvial fans, flood plains and stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches (406 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F (6.1 degrees C).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid Cumulic Endoaquolls
