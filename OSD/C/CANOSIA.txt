CANOSIA SERIES

The Canosia series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in friable loamy drift and the underlying dense loamy till on moraines, till plains and drumlins. Depth to the dense till ranges from moderately deep to very deep. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C, and the mean annual precipitation is about 750 millimeters.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES ESTABLISHED: St. Louis County, Minnesota, 2007 

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 111 centimeters

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 13 centimeters (A horizon);
cambic horizon--the zone from 13 to 64 centimeters (Bw horizons);
aquic condition--based on a presumed positive reaction with alpha,alpha-dipyridyl during some part of the year in normal years. The nature and color of the parent material of this series do not usually show the normal reduced matrix colors typically associated with saturation and reducing conditions.
Isotic mineralogy--based on 1500 kPa water to measured clay ratio of 0.6 or greater

The designation of the 2BCd horizon is based on fractures and platy structure in the densic material. Evidence of clay and silt translocation can be seen on faces between the horizontal plates when broken apart.
