COOKCREEK SERIES

The Cookcreek series consists of moderately deep, well-drained soils on backslopes of canyons and dissected plateaus. Cookcreek soils formed in volcanic ash and loess mixed with colluvium from metavolcanic or metasedimentary rock. Slopes are 30 to 90 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Vitrandic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Cookcreek very gravelly ashy silt loam  shrub steppe, on a 90 percent planar northeast-facing slope at an elevation of 2,170 feet.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)
