COUSHATTA SERIES

The Coushatta series consists of very deep, well drained, soils that formed in calcareous, Holocene loamy alluvium derived from sedimentary rock. These soils are on natural levees of the Arkansas River and Red River alluvial plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C (66 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1334 mm (52.5 in). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, thermic Fluventic Eutrudepts 

TYPICAL PEDON: Coushatta silt loam, on a 0.5 percent slope in a cultivated cotton field; elevation is 39.6 m (130 ft). (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Bw1--20 to 38 cm (8 to 15 in); reddish brown (5YR 4/4) silt loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine roots; many fine pores; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.

    Bw2--38 to 69 cm (15 to 27 in); reddish brown (5YR 4/4) silty clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots; common fine pores; surfaces of peds are dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3); neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bw horizon is 26 to 66 cm [10 to 26 in])

    C1--69 to 97 cm (27 to 38 in); reddish brown (5YR 4/4) silt loam; massive; friable; common fine pores; slightly alkaline, calcareous; abrupt smooth boundary. 

    C2--97 to 112 cm (38 to 44 in); reddish brown (5YR 5/4) loamy very fine sand; massive; very friable; moderately alkaline, calcareous; abrupt smooth boundary. 

    C3--112 to 203cm (44 to 80 in); reddish brown (5YR 4/4) silt loam; massive; friable; few fine strata 0.2 to 3 cm (1/16 to 1 in) thick reddish brown (5YR 4/3) heavy silt loam; moderately alkaline, calcareous.
