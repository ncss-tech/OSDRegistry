CORLENA SERIES

The Corlena series consists of very deep, well drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in calcareous, sandy alluvial sediments of Holocene age. These soils are on nearly level floodplains of narrow draws. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 406 mm (16 in) and mean annual air temperature is 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Typic Ustifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Corlena loamy fine sand - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

      A1--0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 in); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loamy fine sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular parting to weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (8 to 25 cm [3 to 10 in] thick)

      A2--13 to 25 cm (5 to 10 in); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) loamy fine sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak medium subangular parting to weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable; few thin darker colored loamy strata, few rounded siliceous pebbles up to 1.3 cm(1/2 in) in diameter; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 25 cm[0 to 10 in] thick)

     C--25 to 203 (10 to 80 in); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loamy fine sand, yellowish brown(10YR 5/4) moist; single grain, loose; few thin strata of rounded siliceous pebbles up to 1.3 cm (1/2 in) in diameter; few strata 1.3 to 10 cm (1/2 to 4 in) thick with textures of loam, sandy loam and fine sand; strongly effervescent;  moderately alkaline

TYPE LOCATION: Dallam County, Texas; 6 miles north of Perico, Texas, then 450 ft. east of county road along Rita Blanca Creek; 1025 ft. east of northwest corner sec. 13, Block 5 of the FDW Survey.  Latitude: 36 degrees, 21 minutes, 37.8 seconds N; Longitude: 102 degrees, 53 minutes, 8.1 seconds W; Corlena, Texas USGS quad; NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: A typic-ustic moisture regime. The soil moisture control section is dry in some or all parts for 90 or more cumulative days but less than 150 cumulative days in normal years. 
Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 14 degrees C (54 to 59 degrees F)
Solum thickness is more than 203 cm (80 in.) 
Particle-size control section: less than 10 percent silicate clay.

A horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 5 to 7
Chroma: 3 or 4 
Texture: fine sand or loamy fine sand
Coarse fragments: 0 to 9 percent by volume quartzite fragments
Some pedons have value and chroma less than 3.5 but are less than 18 cm [7 in] thick.

C horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR to 10YR
Value: 5 to 7
Chroma: 3 or 4 
Texture: fine sand or loamy fine sand
Coarse fragments: 0 to 9 percent by volume quartzite fragments
Thin loamy strata up to 10 cm (4 in) thick occur in some pedons. Rounded pebbles comprise up to 5 percent by volume in some pedons.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Inavale series in the same family. Similar soils include the Dalupe, Guadalupe, and Valerian (T) soils. 
Inavale soils: are typically free of carbonates at depths greater than 100 cm (40 in.) and have cooler mean annual soil temperatures. 
Brazos soils: lack free carbonates, and have average annual soil temperatures greater than 15 degrees C (59 degrees F). 
Dalupe and Guadalupe soils: have fine sandy loam control sections. In addition, Guadalupe soils have average annual soil temperatures greater than 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).
Valerian soils: are dry in the soil moisture control section for longer periods.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: calcareous, sandy alluvial deposits of Holocene age 
Landform: nearly level floodplains of narrow draws
Slope: 0 to 1 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 381 to 432 mm (15 to 17 in) 
Precipitation Pattern: Precipitation is typically uniform throughout most of the year with rainfall the highest from April through October.  Average snowfall is about 18 inches annually from November through April. 
Mean annual air temperature: 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 F.)
Frost-free period: 165 to 185 days
Elevation: 975 to 1372 m (3,700 to 5,600 ft.)
PZ Index Value: 12 to 17
 
GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the similar Dalupe and Valerian (T) series. Also included are the Dallam, Guy, Karde, Perico, and Rickmore, Spurlock, and Vingo series.
Dallam, Guy, Perico, and Rickmore soils: have an argillic horizon and occur on nearly level to gently sloping plains.
Karde soils: are on playa dunes and have fine-silty particle size class.
Spurlock soils: have carbonatic mineralogy and coarse-loamy particle size class.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained and rapid permeability. Surface runoff is negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes. These soils are occasionally flooded for brief periods. An apparent water table is at a depth of 0.3 to 3.0 m (3 to 10 ft.) during most years.

USE AND VEGETATION: Predominately used for rangeland. The native vegetation is indiangrass, switchgrass, sand bluestem, little bluestem, Canada wildrye, sideoats grama, vine mesquite and sand sagebrush. This soil has been correlated to the Sandy Bottomland (R077BY700TX) ecological site in MLRA-77B.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern High Plains, Northwestern Part (MLRA 77B in LRR H) of Texas and New Mexico north of the Canadian River. The series is of minor extent.
