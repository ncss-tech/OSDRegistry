CARALAMPI SERIES 

The Caralampi series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in fan and slope alluvium from granitic and volcanic rock.  Caralampi soils are on fan terraces and hills.  Slopes range from 1 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic Ustic Haplargids

(Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 12 to 29 inches) 

    BCt1--23 to 31 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) very gravelly sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; common fine faint pink (5YR 7/3) and light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) features, light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films in pores; 50 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Coxwell (NM), Hartpeak (CA), Holliday (NM), Hoppswell (NV), Hyrhy (AZ), Maloy (AZ) and Monza (NM) series. Hartpeak and Hoppswell soils are moist in the soil moisture control section for less than 20 days cumulative between July and September.  Coxwell and Monza soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Holliday soils contain less than 18 percent clay.  Hyrhy soils are inactive.  Maloy soils contain dominantly cobble size rock fragments in the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Caralampi soils are on strongly sloping to steep fan terraces and hills.  Slopes range from 1 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,800 to 5,380 feet.  These soils formed in fan and slope alluvium derived from granite, rhyolite, andesite, dacite, and related tuff, and agglomerates.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 57 to 68 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches.  The frost-free period is 180 to 260 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Riveroad, Comoro, and White House soils.  Riveroad and Comoro soils do not have argillic horizons.  White House soils are clayey. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat and urban development.  Vegetation is curlymesquite, sprucetop grama, hairy grama, sideoats grama, threeawn, cane beardgrass, wolftail, and plains lovegrass.  Brush species are mesquite, catclaw, mimosa, calliandra, range ratany, and a few oak and cacti. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Arizona.  Caralampi soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 38 and 41.
