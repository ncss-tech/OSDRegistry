COMAD SERIES 

The Comad series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium, alluvium, colluvium or alpine till derived from gneiss, schist, granite and quartzite rock.  These soils are on hills, mountains, alluvial fans, stream terraces and moraines.  Slopes are 8 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed Lamellic Cryorthents 

TYPICAL PEDON: Comad extremely stony sandy loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 3 inches; undecomposed and slightly decomposed forest litter. (1 to 3 inches thick) 

    E1--3 to 8 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely stony sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate fine and very fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, and few medium and coarse roots; 15 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles and 30 percent stones; strongly acid (pH 5.4); clear smooth boundary. 

    E2--8 to 20 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) extremely stony loamy sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, and fine, and few medium roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 15 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles and 30 percent stones; strongly acid (pH 5.3); gradual wavy boundary. (combined thickness of E horizons - 5 to 21 inches) 

    E and Bt1--20 to 33 inches; E part (90 percent) very pale brown (10YR 7/3) extremely stony loamy sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; Bt part (10 percent) yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy clay loam lamellae; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; lamellae are wavy and discontinuous, 1/8 to 1/2 inch thick and 2 to 6 inches apart; common very fine and fine, and few medium roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 20 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles and 30 percent stones; moderately acid (pH 5.7); gradual smooth boundary. (10 to 25 inches thick) 

    E and Bt2--33 to 60 inches; E part (95 percent) very pale brown (10YR 7/4) extremely stony loamy sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few fine and medium roots; few very fine tubular pores; Bt2 part (5 percent) dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist sandy loam lamellae; 15 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles and 35 percent stones; moderately acid (pH 5.7).

COMPETING SERIES:
Nanita (CO) - have an udic moisture regime
Ovando (MT) - have an udic moisture regime
Rusbach (NM) - have Bw horizons 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - hills, mountains, alluvial fans, stream terraces and moraines
Elevation - 4,600 to 9,400 feet
Slope - 8 to 80 percent
Parent material - alluvium, colluvium or alpine till derived from gneiss, schist, granite and quartzite rock
Climate - cool with long, cold winters; cool, moist springs
Mean annual precipitation - 18 to 35 inches
Mean annual air temperature - 34 to 41 degrees F.
Frost-free season - 30 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Garlet and Whitore soils. Garlet soils are loamy-skeletal and have horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation. Whitore soils are loamy-skeletal and have carbonatic mineralogy. These soils are on similar landform positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Excessively drained; rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Comad soils are used mainly as woodland.  The potential native vegetation is mainly Douglas fir and lodgepole pine with an understory of bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, elk sedge, snowberry, pinegrass, twinflower, huckleberry, raceme, Oregongrape, kinnikinnick, and heartleaf arnica. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Comad soils are of moderate extent in southwestern Montana. MLRA - 43B, 44B, 46.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Madison County, Montana, 1983. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Albic horizon - from 3 to 20 inches (E1 and E2 horizons)
Horizons with lamellae - from 20 to 60 inches (E and Bt1, E and Bt2 horizons);
Particle-size control section - from 13 to 43 inches (part of E2, E and Bt1, and part of E and Bt2 horizons)
