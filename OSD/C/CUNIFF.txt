CUNIFF SERIES

The Cuniff series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum from sandstone or in colluvium over the sandstone.  These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid, shallow Typic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cuniff fine sandy loam, rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 5 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 7 inches thick)

    Bw--5 to 11 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium and fine subangular blocky; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent, moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick)

    Bk--11 to 16 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) fine sandy loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium and fine subangular blocky; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 20 percent soft sandstone pebbles; continuous distinct coatings of lime on fragments; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 8 inches thick)

    Cr--16 to 60 inches; light olive gray (5Y 6/2) semiconsolidated sedimentary beds; olive gray (5Y 5/2) moist; few fine roots between cracks in upper part; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

COMPETING SERIES:

Hackney (MT) - does not have horizon of secondary carbonate accumulation.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - sedimentary plains, hills.
Elevation - 4,200 to 5,000 feet.
Slope - 2 to 35 percent.
Parent material - residuum from sandstone or in colluvium over the sandstone.
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm summers.
Mean annual precipitation - 15 to 19 inches.
Mean annual temperature - 40 to 45 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 90 to 110 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Cuniff soils are used mainly for rangeland.

Potential native vegetation is mainly rough fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, and prairie junegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Cuniff soils are inextensive in west central and southwestern Montana.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lewis and Clark County, Montana, 1991; proposed in Lewis and Clark County, Montana, 1987.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1210.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the surface to 7 inches (A, upper Bw horizons); a cambic horizon from 5 to 11 inches (Bw horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 inches to the paralithic contact (Bw, Bk horizons); and a paralithic contact at a depth of 16 inches (Cr horizon).  Cuniff soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
