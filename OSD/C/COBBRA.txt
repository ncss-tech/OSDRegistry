COBBRA SERIES

The Cobbra series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium over glaciofluvial deposits derived from sedimentary and quartzite rocks.  Cobbra soils are on strath terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.

Clapper soils have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section and are on fan remnants.

Hazmaz and Lapoint soils are moderately deep to petrocalcic horizons and are on strath terraces.

Solirec soils have argillic horizons and are on fan remnants.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, low runoff, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major uses are irrigated cropland, irrigated pasture, and rangeland.  Potential native vegetation consists of Wyoming big sagebrush, winterfat, Indian ricegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, galleta and needleandthread.  This soil has been correlated to Semidesert Loam (Wyoming Big Sagebrush) - 034XY212UT range sites in Utah.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (Ap2, Bk1, and Bk2 horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 16 inches.  (A horizon)
