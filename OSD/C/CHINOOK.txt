CHINOOK SERIES 

The Chinook series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from glaciofluvial material, or eolian deposits.  Chinook soils are on alluvial fans, hills, escarpments, stream terraces, and till plains.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean air annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

Slopes - 0 to 35 percent. 

Parent material - alluvium from glaciofluvial material or in eolian deposits. 

Climate - long, cold dry winters; moist springs; warm dry summers. 

Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 16 inches, most of which falls as rain during spring and early summer. 

Mean annual air temperature - 39 to 45 degrees F. Range mean annual air temperature to 38 degrees in MLRA 44.

Frost-free period - 90 to 135 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Rhame soils and the Archin, Kremlin, and Twilight soils.  Kremlin and Archin soils are on similar landscapes as the Chinook soils.  Kremlin soils are fine-loamy and Archin soils have a natric horizon.  Rhame and Twilight soils have soft bedrock between 20 and 40 inches and are on sideslopes of uplands.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Moderately rapid permeability.  Runoff is negligible to medium depending on slope. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for dry farmed crops and as rangeland.  The potential native plant community is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, prairie sandreed, needleandthread, little bluestem, forbs, and shrubs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Throughout the eastern plains of Montana and in the adjacent areas of the western parts of North Dakota and South Dakota.  Chinook soils are extensive.
