COLADO SERIES

The Colado series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits over alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Colado soils are on lake plains, alluvial flats and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series recognized in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Colado soils are on lake plains, alluvial flats and stream terraces.  These soils formed in eolian deposits over alluvium and lucustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1160 to 1280 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool moist winter and warm dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 180 mm, the mean annual temperature is 9 to 12 degrees C., and the frost free period is 120 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:   These are the Placeritos, Sonoma, Sondoa, and Isolde soils.  Placeritos and Sonoma soils have a fine silty particle-size control section and have an irregular decrease in carbon.  Sondoa soils have a fine silty particle-size control section.  Isolde soils have a sandy particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; slow runoff; rapid permeability; very high saturated hydraulic conductivity in the upper part, and slow permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity on in the lower part.  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 100 and 150 cm (deep free water occurrence class) between May and September.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  These soils are susceptible to rare flooding for very brief periods between December and June.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Colado soils are used mainly for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is black greasewood, Torrey's quailbush, and inland saltgrass.  Some small areas have been leveled and are used for alfalfa hay.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  These soils are not extensive MLRA 27.
