CAKEHILL SERIES

The Cakehill series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits and slope alluvium over residuum derived from sandstone.  Cakehill soils are on strath terraces.  Slopes range from 2 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Natrargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cakehill sandy loam, on a north facing, convex-concave, 2 percent slope in a fourwing saltbush rangeland at an elevation of 5,060 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 4 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine platy structure parting to weak fine and very fine subangular blocky; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine, few medium roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; very slightly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); clear smooth boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick)

    Bw--4 to 13 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine and very fine subangular blocky; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine, few medium roots; common very fine and fine, few medium tubular pores; very slightly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 9 inches thick)

    Btkn--13 to 21 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine roots; common very fine and fine, few medium tubular pores; few faint clay films on ped faces; strongly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated and segregated as common fine irregular shaped soft masses and nodules; strongly alkaline (pH 8.9); clear wavy boundary.  (7 to 16 inches thick)

    2Cn1--21 to 30 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) loamy sand, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky geogenic structure parting to weak very fine and fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine, few medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; very slightly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2); clear irregular boundary.

    2Cn2--30 to 38 inches; pale yellow (5Y 7/3) loamy sand, olive (5Y 4/3) moist; moderate coarse platy geogenic structure parting to moderate medium and fine angular blocky; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; very slightly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2); clear irregular boundary.

    2Cr--38 inches; weathered sandstone.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Appian, Biddleman, and Bighat series.

Appian, Biddleman, and Bighat soils are all very deep

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  eolian deposits and slope alluvium over residuum derived from sandstone
Landform:  strath terraces
Slopes:  2 to 5 percent
Elevation: 4,700 to 5,500 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  45 to 47 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  5 to 8 inches
Frost-free period:  110 to 125 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cadrina, Minchey, Muff, and Nakoy series.

Cadrina soils occur on hillslopes and are shallow.

Minchey and Nakoy soils occur on fan remnants and are very deep.

Muff soils occur on structural benches and do not have a sandy substratum.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, low runoff, moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major uses are rangeland, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  The potential native plant community is fourwing saltbush, shadscale, Indian ricegrass, sand dropseed, and spiny hopsage.  This soil has been correlated to Desert Alkali Sand (Fourwing Saltbush) - 034XY106UT range site at the type location in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Utah.  LRR D, MLRA 34.  This series is of small extent.
