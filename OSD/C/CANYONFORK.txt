CANYONFORK SERIES

The Canyonfork series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from fanglomerate, consisting of fragments of limestone, dolomite, and quartzite. Canyonfork soils are on young alluvial fans on fan remnant toeslopes. Slope ranges from 4 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 450 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.

These soils formed in alluvium derived from fanglomerate consisting of fragments of limestone, dolomite, and quartzite. 
Slopes are 4 to 15 percent. 
Elevations range from 1,965 to 2,800 m. 
The climate is dry-subhumid, cool, moist winters and warm dry summers. 
The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 500 mm. These soils receive some additional run-on moisture. 
Mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C.
