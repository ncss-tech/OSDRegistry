CHATTICUP SERIES

The Chatticup series consists of very shallow and shallow well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from altered granitic and metamorphic rocks. Chatticup soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 5 to 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 to 69 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, thermic Lithic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Chatticup extremely cobbly coarse sandy loam, recreation and wildlife habitat.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The surface is covered by approximately 40 percent pebbles, 30 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones.

     A--0 to 2 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely cobbly coarse sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; few fine tubular and common very fine and fine interstitial pores; 40 percent pebbles, 30 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 4 inches thick)

     Bk--2 to 12 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; few medium and common fine and very fine roots; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; many moderately thick lime coats on the undersides of pebbles; 70 percent pebbles, 5 percent cobbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 12 inches thick)

     R--12 inches; hard granitic bedrock, with a discontinuous 1 to 4 inch thick weathering rind above the hard bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION: Clark County, Nevada; in the Eldorado Mountains, approximately 1/4 mile south of Aztec Wash along a powerline road, just inside the boundary of Lake Mead National Recreation Area; about 200 feet east and 1,600 feet south of the northwest corner of section 30, T.26 S., R.65 E.; 35 degrees, 39 minutes, 22 seconds north latitude and 114 degrees, 46 minutes, 32 seconds west longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Usually dry, moist in some part for short periods during winter and early spring and for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July to October following convection storms.

Soil temperature - 66 to 71 degrees F.

Depth to bedrock - 6 to 14 inches.


Control section - Percent clay: 8 to 18 percent.

Rock fragments: 60 to 80 percent, dominantly pebbles, with 25 to 40 percent in the 2 to 5 millimeter fraction.


A horizon - Value: 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist

Chroma: 3 or 4


Bk horizon - Value: 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist

Chroma: 3 or 4

Texture of the fine earth: Coarse sandy loam or sandy loam

Structure: Subangular blocky or massive

Consistence: Soft or slightly hard, slightly sticky or nonsticky, slightly plastic or nonplastic

Other features: Calcium carbonate equivalent by weight in the < 20 millimeter fraction is less than 15 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Akela(NM), Beach(T TX), Haleburu(NV), Hindu(T AZ), Hulda(T AZ), Tecopa(CA), and Upspring(CA) series. Akela soils occur on mixed volcanic rocks and have less than 60 percent rock fragments in the control section. Beach soils occur on sandstone, have colors of 2.5YR or 5YR and have less than 25 percent of the rock fragments in the 2 to 5 millimeter fraction. Haleburu soil contain 35 to 65 percent rock fragment in the particle size control section. Hindu soils have greater than 15 percent calcium carbonate in the Bk horizon and contain less than 60 percent rock fragments. Hulda soils occur on mixed volcanic rocks and contain less than 60 percent rock fragments.  Tecopa soils occur on mixed volcanic rocks, have less than 60 percent rock fragments in the control section. Upspring soils occur on mixed volcanic rocks, have less than 60 percent rock fragments in the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chatticup soils are on hills and mountains.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from altered granitic and metamorphic rocks.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent. Elevations are 1,900 to 3,200 feet. The climate is hot and arid with warm, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is  5 to 7 inches; mean annual temperature is  64 to 69 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 220 to 250 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Goldroad, and Haleburu series. Goldroad soils are hyperthermic. Haleburu soils occur on mixed volcanic rocks and have less than 60 percent rock fragments in the contol section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; very rapid runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Recreation and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly Mojave buckwheat, white bursage, creosotebush, Mojave aster and desert needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Extreme southeastern Nevada, along the Colorado River drainage. MLRA 30. These soils are moderately extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California

SERIES PROPOSED: Clark County, Nevada, 1993.

REMARKS: The name is coined from Techchatticup Wash north of the type location.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 2 inches. (A horizon).

Particle-size control section - The zone from the soil surface to 12 inches (A and Bk horizons).
