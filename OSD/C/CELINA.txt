CELINA SERIES

The Celina series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are moderately deep to dense till. They formed in as much as 46 cm (18 inches) of loess and the underlying loamy till of high-lime content. They are on till plains and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (53 degree F).

Eudy and Tarlton soils have bedrock within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Hartville, Jerktail, and Loudon soils have sola greater than 102 cm (40 inches) in thickness. Licking soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Whippany soils have hue redder than 10YR in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Celina soils are on till plains and moraines of Late Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. They formed in as much as 46 cm (18 inches) of loess and the underlying loamy till of high-lime content. The till typically contains less than 24 percent clay and has calcium carbonate equivalent ranging from 25 to 45 percent. Rock fragments are primarily limestone but includes acid shale, sandstone, and igneous rocks. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 838 to 1067 mm (33 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 11 to 13 degrees C (51 to 55 degrees F). Mean summer air temperature ranges from 23 to 24 degrees C (73 to 75 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brookston, Corwin, Crosby, Fincastle, Kokomo, Miamian, Milton, Odell, Randolph, and Xenia soils. The poorly drained Brookston soils and very poorly drained Kokomo soils are in drainageways. The moderately well drained Corwin soils have a dark surface and are on adjoining landscapes. The somewhat poorly drained Crosby and Fincastle soils are on lower positions of the landscape. In addition, Fincastle soils have more than 46 cm (18 inches) of loess. Miamian soils are well drained and are on higher landscape positions. Milton soils are well drained and are on areas where bedrock is less than 102 cm (40 inches). Odell and Randolph soils are somewhat poorly drained and on lower positions of the landscape. In addition, Randolph soils are on areas where bedrock is less than 102 cm (40 inches). The moderately well drained Xenia soils have more than 46 cm (18 inches) of loess and are on adjacent landscapes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 1.0 to 2.5 feet between February and April in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is medium or high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high above the dense till and low in the dense till. Permeability is moderately slow above the dense till, and very slow in the dense till.

USE AND VEGETATION: A large part is under cultivation. Principal crops are corn, soybeans, wheat, oats and meadow of legumes or legume-grass mixtures. Local areas are used for growing vegetables. A relatively small part is in permanent bluegrass pasture or in woodland. Native vegetation is deciduous forest, principally oaks, maple, elm, hickory and ash.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 111A, 111B, 111D, and 111E in Ohio and Indiana, and MLRAs 98 and 99 in Michigan. The type location is in MLRA 111A. The series is of large extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Clark County, Ohio, 1949.

REMARKS: Lab data for the type location (PB-17) shows that the particle-size class is fine-loamy. The particle-size classification needs to be re-evaluated during MLRA updating activities and a new type location established.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 20 cm (Ap horizon).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 20 to 74 cm (Bt, 2Bt, 2BCt horizons).
Densic contact: at 74 cm (top of the 2Cd horizon).
Aquic conditions: redox features visible in all horizons below a depth of 43 cm.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available from the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory (KSSL), Lincoln, Nebraska. Data for pedons sampled by the Agricultural Experiment Station at Purdue University and The Ohio State University are also available from KSSL.
