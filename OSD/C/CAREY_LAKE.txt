CAREY LAKE SERIES



The Carey Lake series consists of very deep, well drained soils that

formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Carey Lake soils are on level

to gently sloping alluvial fan terraces and have slopes of 0 to 4

percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The average annual

precipitation is about 14 inches, and the average annual temperature is

about 43 degrees F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Argixerolls



TYPICAL PEDON:  Carey Lake loam on a 1 percent slope at an elevation of

4,750 feet in a grainfield.  When described March 6, 1981, the pedon

was moist to 30 inches, then dry below.  (Colors are for dry soil

unless otherwise noted.)



    Ap--0 to 8 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish

brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very

friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and

fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; neutral (pH 7.2); clear

wavy boundary.  (8 to 10 inches thick)



    A--8 to 12 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish

brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft,

very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine

and fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt

wavy boundary.  (4 to 6 inches thick)



    Bt--12 to 20 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, very dark

grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong fine and medium subangular

blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common

very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; few

thin clay films on face of peds and lining pores; neutral (pH 6.8);

abrupt wavy boundary.  (8 to 12 inches thick)



    BC1--20 to 31 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, dark brown

(10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very

friable, slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common fine

tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (11 to 13

inches thick)



    BC2--31 to 42 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam,

very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; few fine and medium faint

yellowish; brown (10YR 5/6) relic mottles; weak medium subangular

blocky structure, slightly hard, friable; few very fine and fine roots;

common fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (7

to 11 inches thick)



    2C1--42 to 47 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, dark brown

(10YR 3/3) moist; many fine and medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR

5/3) fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; many fine and medium

prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) relic mottles; massive; slightly

hard, friable; few very fine and fine roots; few fine tubular pores;

neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (5 to 14 inches thick)



    2C2--47 to 72 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark

grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; many fine and medium prominent

yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) relic mottles; massive; slightly hard,

friable; few very fine and fine roots; few fine tubular pores; neutral

(pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (16 to 25 inches thick)



TYPE LOCATION:  Blaine County, Idaho, about 1.5 miles south and 0.5

miles east of Carey, Idaho; 50 feet west and 100 feet south of the

northwest corner of section 3 T.25, R. 21E.



RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:



Average annual soil temperature - 42 to 47 degrees F

Depth to bedrock - greater than 60 inches

Depth to base of argillic - 20 to 28 inches



A horizon

Value, Moist - 2 or 3



Bt horizon

Texture - L, CL, SICL

Clay content - 22 to 33 percent

Rock fragments - 0 to 10 percent



BC horizon

Chroma, dry or moist - 2 or 3

Texture - FSL, L, CL

Clay content - 15 to 28 percent

Rock fragments - 0 to 10 percent

2C horizon

Texture - VFSL, FSL, L

Reaction - neutral to mildly alkaline



COMPETING SERIES:  Bly, Hades, and Strom.  Bly and Strom have more than

10 percent rock fragments in the Bt horizon.  Hades soils are deeper

than 28 inches to the base of the argillic.  Strom soils are somewhat

poorly drained.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Carey Lake soils are on nearly level to gently

sloping alluvial fans and terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.

Elevation ranges from 4,700 to 6,000 feet.  The soil formed in alluvium

from mixed sources.  The average annual precipitation is 12 to 16

inches, most of which falls as snow and early spring rains.  The

average air temperature is about 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free

season is 70 to 90 days.


GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Adamson, Balaam, Brinegar, Bruneel,

Hutton, and Little Wood.  Adamson, and Balaam soils are well drained

and lack argillic horizons.  Brinegar soils have less than 75 percent

base saturation in the upper 30 inches.  Bruneel soils are somewhat

poorly drained and underlain by sands and gravels.  Little Wood soils

are well drained and contain greater than 35 percent rock fragments in

the control section.  Adamson and Balaam soils occur on low fan

terraces.  Bruneel and Hutton soils occur on flood plains.  Brinegar

and Little Wood occur on the same landscape as the Carey Lake soils.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is slow.

Permeability is moderately slow.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for irrigated cropland.  Crops include

small grains and alfalfa.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Idaho.  The series is of

limited extent.  Series proposed, Blaine County, Idaho, 1981.



MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Blaine County, Idaho, 1985.



REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series

are:



Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of

approximately 72 inches



Argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 12 to 28 inches (Bt

horizon)



A permanent change in drainage has lowered the watertable and this

series is well drained.
