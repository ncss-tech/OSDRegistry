CARR SERIES

The Carr series consists of very deep, well drained and moderately well drained, soils formed in calcareous stratified alluvium. These soils are on flood plains. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature at the type location is about 12.2 degrees C.(54 degrees F.). Mean annual precipitation is 71 centimeters (28 inches). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Typic Udifluvents 

TYPICAL PEDON: Carr fine sandy loam - cultivated. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

  Ap--0 to 31 centimeters (0 to 12 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; slight effervescence; slightly alkaline, clear smooth boundary. [8 to 46 centimeters thick (3 to 18 inches)].

  C--31 to 127 centimeters (12 to 50 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak medium granular structure in the upper part and massive in the lower part; soft, very friable; thin stratified layers of finer textured and coarser textured materials are throughout the horizon; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. [51 to 122 centimeters thick (20 to 48 inches)].

  2C--127 to 203 centimeters (50 to 80 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sand, light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; single grain; loose; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline.
 
TYPE LOCATION: Republic County, Kansas; about 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) south and  .965 kilometers (0.6 mile) west of Scandia, Kansas; 628.8 meters (2,060 feet) east and 65.5 meters (215 feet) south of the northwest corner of sec. 20, T. 3 S., R. 4 W. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Thickness of the solum ranges from 8 to 46 centimeters (3 to 18 inches) and corresponds to the thickness of the A horizon. 
Depth to free carbonates is less than 25 centimeters (10 inches). 
Depth to lithologic discontinuity ranges from 100 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches). 
The control section is finer than very fine sand. 
Content of clay in the particle-size control section (weighted average): 5 to 18 percent.
Content of sand in the particle-size control section (weighted average): 40 to 80 percent. 
The soil is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout. 

Ap horizon:

Clay content: 5 to 18 percent
Sand content: 40 to 80 percent

Thickness: [51 to 122 thick centimeters (20 to 48 inches)].

2 C horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 5 or 6 (6 or 7 dry)
Chroma: 2 or 3
Redoximorphic features: Faint iron accumulations are below depths of 51 centimeters (20 inches) and distinct iron accumulations are below 76 centimeters (30 inches) in some pedons.
Texture: loamy sand, fine sand, sand, or loamy fine sand, which in some pedons contain 1 to 5 percent of fine gravel.
Clay content:  0 to 10 percent
Sand content: 70 to 100 percent
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES:  
Rocher soils are dominated by very fine sand and they occur in areas of higher precipitation. 
Stonelick soils have control sections in which the sand is dominantly coarser than fine sand. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: calcareous stratified alluvium
Landform : nearly level flood plains
Slopes:0 to 3 percent
Elevation:305 to 457 meters (1000 to 1500 feet) above sea level
Mean annual air temperature: Thornthwaites Annual P-E Index ranges from 7 to 18 degrees C (44 to 64 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 640 to 860 millimeters (25 to 35 inches)
Frost-free period:160 to 170 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the: 
Eudora soils are coarse-silty and are on slightly higher topographic positions. 
Haynie soils are coarse-silty and are on similar landscape positions 
Grable soils are coarse-silty,  are on similar landscape positions, and have lithologic discontinuity within 40 inches. 
Sarpy soils are sandy and are on similar positions.
