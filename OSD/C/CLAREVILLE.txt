CLAREVILLE SERIES

The Clareville series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvial sediments of Holocene age. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on base slope on draws and drainageways. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent but mainly less that 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 711 mm (28 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 150 to 203 (60 to 80 in).  The mollic epipedon is 50 to 127 cm (20 to 50 in) thick.  
Soil Moisture: A typic-ustic moisture regime. The soil moisture control section is dry in some or all parts for more than 90 days but less than 180 cumulative days in normal years.  June through August and December through February are the driest months.  These soils are intermittently moist in September through November and March through May. Mean annual soil temperature: 22 to 24 (72 to 75 degrees F).
