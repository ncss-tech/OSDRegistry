CALPET SERIES

The Calpet series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rock.  These soils are on escarpments and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 430 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 1 degree C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Calpet loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 7 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/2) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, and common medium and coarse roots; many fine interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 20 cm thick)

    Btk1--7 to 26 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, and common medium and coarse roots; many fine interstitial pores; 20 percent continuous distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 35 percent continuous prominent calcium carbonate coats on bottom surfaces of rock fragments; 25 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 35 cm thick)

    Btk2--26 to 68 cm; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) very gravelly clay loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium and coarse roots; many fine interstitial pores; 45 percent continuous distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 45 percent continuous prominent calcium carbonate coats on bottom surfaces of rock fragments, 2 percent calcium carbonate masses in matrix, and finely disseminated calcium carbonate in matrix; 30 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); gradual wavy boundary. (30 to 50 cm thick)

    Bk--68 to 200 cm; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) very gravelly loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium roots; many fine interstitial pores; 55 percent continuous prominent calcium carbonate coats on bottom surfaces of rock fragments, 4 percent calcium carbonate masses in matrix, and finely disseminated calcium carbonate in matrix; 30 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5).
