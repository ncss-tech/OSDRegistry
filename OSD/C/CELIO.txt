CELIO SERIES

The Celio series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in glacial outwash on outwash terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 890 mm and the mean annual temperature is 6 degrees c.

TYPE LOCATION: El Dorado County, California; Lake Tahoe; 1/4 mile west of Meyers checking station, west side of Hwy 89 extension; 0.1 mile north of southeast corner sec. 30, T. 12 N., R. 18 E. MDB&M. 38 degrees, 51 minutes, 8 seconds N latitude and 120 degrees, 1 minute, 22 seconds W longitude NAD27, Echo Lake 7.5 minute series topographic quadrangle.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil moisture: These soils are never dry in all horizons between depth of 30 to 89 cm for as much as 45 to 60 consecutive days because of moisture movement above the cemented layer.

Soil Temperature: The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 5 to 8 degrees C. The mean summer soil temperature varies from 13 to 15 degrees C.

Depth to the silica cemented horizon ranges from 100 to 150 cm.

Redoximorphic features: 53 to 76 cm. 

When present, 0 horizons range from 3 to 8 cm thick. 

A horizon:
  Hue: 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR.
  Value: 3 through 5 dry, 3 moist
  Chroma: 2 through 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist
  Organic matter: 2 to 8 percent. 
  Texture: loamy coarse sand, loamy sand or coarse sandy loam 
  Rock fragments: 15 to 40 percent gravel and/or cobbles.
  Reaction: slightly to moderately acid. 


BA horizon:
  Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR
  Value: 5 or 6 dry or moist
  Chroma: 3 through 8 dry or moist
  Texture: coarse sand, loamy coarse sand or loamy sand
  Rock fragments: 35 to 70 percent gravel and/or cobbles
  Reaction: moderately acid to neutral. 

2Bqm horizon
  Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR 
  Value: 4 through 6 moist or dry 
  Chroma: 4through 8, moist or dry
  Cementation: weakly to strongly cemented with silica and is very firm to extremely firm in place but ruptures under pressure.

2Bg horizons
  Hue: 10YR or N moist or dry 
  Value: 7 or 8 moist or dry 
  Chroma: / through 2, moist or dry
  Texture: stratified with layers of coarse sand or gravel

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Celio soils are on nearly level to gently sloping glacial outwash at elevations of 1860 to 2075 meters. They formed in gravelly and cobbly sandy alluvium derived from mixed but dominantly granitic sources. The climate is cool continental. Mean annual precipitation varies from 635 to 1524 millimeters. Cold water from snow melt keeps the soil temperature below 15 degrees C throughout the summer. The mean annual temperature is 6 degrees C, mean January temperature is -3 degrees C, and mean July temperature is 15 degrees C. The frost-free season is 25 to 100 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Tahoe, Gefo, Marla and Meeks soils. The Gefo soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments, are well drained and are on outwash terraces.  Tahoe and Marla soils are poorly drained with the Tahoe soils on flood plains and Marla in and around the flood plain.  Meeks soils are somewhat excessively drained and are on moraines.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; high runoff; rapid permeability to the silica cementation and very slow below. The soils are saturated within 30 inches of the surface from January to July. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for homesites, recreation, range, and woodland. Native vegetation is lodgepole pine, juniper, perennial grasses, and meadow grasses. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Glacial outwash areas of the Sierra Nevada Range. The series is not extensive.
