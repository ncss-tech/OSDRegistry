CORNUCOPIAPEAK SERIES

The Cornucopiapeak series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on ridges and shoulder slopes of mountains. Cornucopiapeak soils formed in volcanic ash and loess mixed in colluvium or residuum from basalt. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches and the mean air annual temperature is about 35 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: ashy, glassy Humic Xeric Vitricryands 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cornucopiapeak ashy silt loam - rangeland, on a 25 percent southwestfacing slope at an elevation of 7,040 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

 A--0 to 12 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) ashy silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) dry; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and common medium roots; common fine and very fine irregular and few fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.5); gradual smooth boundary. (7 to 12 inches thick)

 AB--12 to 24 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) ashy silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) dry; weak very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; common fine and few medium tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.5); gradual smooth boundary. (5 to 14 inches thick)

 Bw--24 to 36 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) gravelly ashy silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) dry; weak fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; few fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; strongly acid (pH 5.5); abrupt smooth boundary. (7 to 16 inches thick)

  R--36 inches: basalt
