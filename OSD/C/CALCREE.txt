CALCREE SERIES

The Calcree series consists of moderately deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone.  Calcree soils are on stream bottoms and stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Aeric Endoaquents

TYPICAL PEDON: Calcree fine sand, on a 1 percent slope in a stream bottom at an elevation of 5614 feet.  When described on March 1, 1999 the soil was saturated from 22 to 27 inches. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

       A--0 to 8 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4), fine sand, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; single grained structure; loose, loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine and many medium, coarse roots; 7 percent fine distinct yellowish red (5YR 5/8) iron-manganese masses in pores linings and root channels; 30 percent black (10YR 2/1) organic staining on faces of peds; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 10 inches thick)

       C1--8 to 15 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4), fine sand, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive structure; loose, loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine and common medium, coarse roots; 3 percent fine distinct yellowish red (5YR 5/8) iron- manganese masses in pore linings and root channels; 10 percent black (10YR 2/1) organic staining on faces of peds; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick)

       C2--15 to 27 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/4), fine sand, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist; massive structure; loose, loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine roots; 15 percent fine distinct black (10YR 2/1) manganese coatings on faces of peds and 10 percent black (10YR 2/1) organic stains on faces of peds; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt wavy boundary. (10 to 15 inches thick)

       R--27 inches; Navajo sandstone bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION: Garfield County, UT; USGS King Bench 7.5 minute quadrangle; lat. 37 degrees 50 minutes 49.54 seconds N. and long. 111 degrees 21 minutes 13.39 seconds W., NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Aquic soil moisture regime. The soil is saturated to the surface with water for a period of at least 2 weeks during the time the soil temperature is above 40 degrees F.

Mean annual soil temperature - 47 to 54 degrees F 

Depth to lithic contact - 20 to 40 inches to sandstone 

Depth to redox concentrations - 0 to 8 inches

Particle-size control section (weighted average)-

Clay content: 0 to 8 percent 

Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent gravel 

A horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR 
Value: 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 5 moist 
Chroma: 3 to 6 dry, or moist 
Notes: The A horizon is sometimes capped by a 1-2 inch layer of organic material or muck (Oi or Oe horizon)

C horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR 
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist 
Chroma: 3 to 6 dry, or moist 
Texture: fine sand or sand 
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent gravel 

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: alluvium derived from sandstone 
Landform: stream terraces, drainageways 
Slopes: 0 to 4 percent 
Elevation: 4800 to 5800 feet 
Mean annual air temperature: 45 to 52 degrees F 
Mean annual precipitation: 9 to 12 inches 
Frost-free period: 120 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bowington and Mespun series.
The Bowington soils are very deep and are on floodplains. The Mespun soils are very deep and are on high terraces with eolian sands.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: poorly drained, low runoff, very rapid permeability, frequently flooded more than or equal to 50 times in 100 years between July and September, occasionally flooded (5 to 50 times in 100 years) from March to May.

USE AND VEGETATION: The major uses are for wildlife habitat and limited livestock grazing.  Potential native vegetation is sedges, Baltic rushes, Kentucky bluegrass, redtop, basin wildrye, and western wheatgrass. This soil has been correlated to the Semiwet Fresh Meadow 035XY010UT ecological site at the type location in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South Central, Utah; LRR D, MLRA 35; This series is of small extent.
