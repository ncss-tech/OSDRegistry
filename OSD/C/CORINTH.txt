CORINTH SERIES

The Corinth series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly and moderately slowly permeable soils formed in residuum weathered from calcareous clayey shales. These nearly level to moderately steep hills formed on ridgetops and side slopes primarily in the Rolling Plains and Breaks (MLRA 73).  Slope gradients range from 1 to 17 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 24 inches, and mean annual temperature is 54 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Calciustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Corinth silty clay loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  A1--0 to 13 centimeters (0 to 5 inches); grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many fine roots; few worm casts; few flat pieces of calcite; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline, 5 percent calcium carbonate; clear smooth boundary

  A2--13 to 23 centimeters (5 to 9 inches); light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) silty clay loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm moderately sticky, moderately plastic; many fine roots; few worm casts; few flat pieces of calcite; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline, 10 percent calcium carbonate; gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizons is 5 to 41 centimeters (2 to 16 inches.)

  Bw--23 to 41 centimeters (9 to 16 inches); light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) silty clay, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky, very plastic; many fine roots; 44 percent clay; few worm casts; few flat pieces of calcite; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline, 20 percent calcium carbonate; gradual smooth boundary.

  Bk1--41 to 56 centimeters (16 to 22 inches); light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) silty clay, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky, very plastic; few very fine roots; 47 percent clay; few soft platy fragments of calcareous shale; few flat pieces of calcite; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline, 28 percent calcium carbonate; gradual smooth boundary.  (The combined thickness of the Bw horizons is 10 to 74 centimeters (4 to 29 inches.)

  Bk2--56 to 76 centimeters (22 to 30 inches); brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) silty clay; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure with many soft platy fragments of chalky shale; very hard, firm, moderately sticky, very plastic; few fine roots; 47 percent clay; many flat pieces of calcite; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline, 29 percent calcium carbonate; gradual boundary.  (0 to 31 centimeters (0 to 12 inches thick)

  Cr--76 to 102 centimeters (30 to 40 inches); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) and brown (10YR 4/3) soft platy shale of silty clay loam texture; strong effervescence; moderate excavation difficulty; moderately alkaline, 36 percent calcium carbonate.

TYPE LOCATION: Ellis County, Kansas; about 11 miles north and 4 miles east of Victoria; 1,640 feet west and 3,090 feet north of the southeast corner of sec. 10, T. 12 S., R. 16 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth of the solum: ranges from 38 to 76 centimeters (15 to 30 inches).
Depth of paralithic contact: 51 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) 
Depth to secondary calcium carbonate: typically contains free carbonates throughout
Note: Some pedons lack carbonates in the upper 15 centimeters (6 inches). 

Particle-size control section (weighted average): 
Clay content: 35 to 50 percent 
Sand content: 5 to 25 percent 

A horizon:
Hue: 2.5Y or 10YR 
Value: 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist 
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: silty clay loam or clay loam
Clay content: 27 to 39
Reaction: Moderately alkaline
Note: In some pedons the upper part of the A horizon has a value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.

Bw horizon:
Hue: 2.5Y or 10YR
Value: 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 3 to 6
Texture: silty clay loam or silty clay 
Clay content: 35 and 50 percent 
Reaction: moderately alkaline

C and Cr horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y 
Value: 6 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist 
Chroma: 4 to 8
Texture: silty clay loam or silty clay 
Clay content: 35 and 50 percent 
Reaction: moderately alkaline 
Note: The excavation difficulty on the Cr horizon is moderate.

COMPETING SERIES: Currently there are no competing series

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent Material: residue weathered from cretaceous age calcareous, clayey shales
Landform: both convex and concave slopes of rolling ridges and slopes
Slope: 1 to 17 percent.
Mean annual temperature: 11 to 13 degrees C (52 to 56 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 48 to 71 centimeters (19 to 28 inches)
Thornthwaite Annual P-E Index: 34 to 44

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Armo, Bogue, Carlson, Harney, and Nibson soils.
Armo soils have fine-loamy control sections and formed in loamy sediments derived from limestone.
Bogue soils have more clay and formed in residuum from acid shales.
Carlson and Harney soils have argillic horizons.
Harney soils formed in loess, typically on higher areas.
Nibson soils have less clay and a paralithic contact at depths of less than 20 inches.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage: well drained
Runoff: medium or rapid
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: moderately low

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of the less sloping areas are cultivated.  
Principal crops are wheat and sorghum.  
Steeper slopes are mostly in native grass.  
Native vegetation is tall and mid grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North-central Kansas and adjacent parts of Nebraska.  The series is of moderate extent.
