CRETE SERIES

The Crete series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loess. Crete soils are on interfluves and hillslopes on loess uplands and loess-covered stream terraces on river valleys in Central Loess Plains, MLRA 75. Slopes range from 0 to 11 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (53 degrees F).

When there are secondary carbonates present, the BC and C horizons are now being called Bk horizons to indicate soil development. Bk horizons would have the same properties as described in the Range in Characteristics for the BC and C horizons.   

COMPETING SERIES: They are the Blazefork and Ladysmith series. 
The Blazefork soils have a lithologic discontinuity with textures having sand contents greater than 20 percent below 100 cm.
The Ladysmith soils are somewhat poorly drained.

Mean annual temperature: 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 560 to 860 millimeters (22 to 34 inches)
Precipitation pattern: Precipitation is usually evenly distributed throughout the year with the exception of November through February being the driest months and May and June being the wettest months.  Summer precipitation occurs during intense summer thunderstorms.
Frost-free period: 149 to 196 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Butler, Fillmore, and Hastings soils
Butler soils are on flat or slightly concave swales on uplands, have an aquic soil moisture regime, and are somewhat poorly drained. 
Fillmore soils are in closed depressions, have an albic horizon, and are somewhat poorly drained. 
Hastings soils are on similar landform positions but have mollic epipedons less than 50 centimeters (20 inches) thick. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage: Moderately well drained
Runoff: low to high
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: moderately low

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cropped.
The main crops are corn, soybeans, sorghum and wheat. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Nebraska and adjoining parts of 
north-central Kansas; Land Resource Region H, Central Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range Region, Rolling Plain and Breaks MLRA 73, Central Kansas Sandstone Hills MLRA 74 and Central Loess Plains MLRA 75. Crete soils are extensive.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Salina, Kansas

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Adams County, Nebraska, 1923.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon: Mollic epipedon: 0 to 71 centimeters (0 to 28 inches) (the Ap, A, BA, and Bt1 horizon)
Argillic horizon: 48 to 89 centimeters (19 to 35 inches) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizon).
Vertic features: The presence of linear extensibility of 6.0 cm or more between 0 and 100 centimeters (0 to 40 inches). This was determined from lab data for Crete soils. 
Severely eroded Crete soils no longer classify as Mollisols and need to be correlated to a new series. 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Data from pedons S60NE-18-1, S55NE-30-1, S55NE-30-2, S55NE-76-1 and S55NE-76-2 are published in Nebraska Soil Survey Investigations Report No.5. Additional KSSL characterization data available for pedons 53KS169001, 53KS169002, 55NE151001, 60NE035001, 78NE081001,78NE081002, 79NE059003, 79NE059004, 79NE059009, 79NE059011, 79NE059012, 79NE059019, 80NE059018, 81NE059012, 85NE035101, 85NE035103, 85NE035104, 85NE035106, 85NE035107, 85NE035109, 85NE035110,  89KS061002, 90NE035001, 92NE129001, 97KS029171, and S08NE035001.

Updated competing series.
Changed permeability to Saturated Hydraulic conductivity. 

8/02/11 DJK
Changed classification from Pachic Argiustolls to Pachic Udertic Argiustolls due to Crete meeting the requirements of being vertic based on lab data.

Deleted silty clay as a texture for BC in RIC.
Added in slope, slope shape, and elevation for typical pedon.
Added quad and latitude/longitude for type location.
Updated competing series for new classification.
Added in elevation and FFD and updated the landform in geographic setting.
Updated geographically associated soils to meet MO5 standards (deleted Hall, Holdrege, and Wymore and updated differences of Butler, Fillmore and Hastings).
Updated basic formatting along with adding in metric values where needed.

8/2012 DJK  Added depth to argillic in RIC. Added soil moisture and temperature statement to RIC. Added BA to RIC. Removed slightly alkaline from reaction for the Bt (upper) horizon. Removed moderately acid from reaction for the Bt (lower) horizon. Added CCE to the BC and C horizons in RIC and added statement on now being Bk horizons. Edited competing series.
