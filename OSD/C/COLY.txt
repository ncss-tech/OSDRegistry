COLY SERIES

The Coly series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in loess. Coly soils are on sideslopes of uplands in MLRA  73-Rolling Plains and Breaks. Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent. Mean annual temperature is 10 degrees C ( 50 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 53 centimeters ( 21 inches) at the type location.

A horizon
Hue: 10YR

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Harlan County, Nebraska, May 1970. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 10 centimeters (0 to 4 inches) (A horizon)
Moisture regime: typic ustic
These soils were formerly mapped as Colby soils. Colby soils are now limited to a drier (33 to 51 centimeters (13 to 20 inches precipitation)) climate. 
The series Typical Pedon was moved from Stockton to Eustis. This site fits the series concept and was sampled in 1979. The pedon number is 79NE063002. The National Soil Survey Lab report can be found at :
