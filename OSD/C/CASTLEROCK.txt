CASTLEROCK SERIES

The Castlerock series consists of deep, well drained soils with moderately slow saturated hydraulic conductivity that formed in alluvium from tuff and volcaniclastic sediments. Slopes range from 4 to 35 percent in foothills. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Torrertic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Castlerock loam -- on a slightly convex south-facing slope of 6 percent, in rangeland at 3,020 feet elevation. When described on October 12, 1995, the soil was dry to 12 inches and slightly moist below. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Bk1--40 to 45 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) paragravelly clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 15 percent pararock fragments; violently effervescent, common fine seams of calcium carbonate; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. 

 Bk2--45 to 54 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) extremely paragravelly loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 85 percent pararock fragments; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); clear wavy boundary. (combined Bk - 5 to 20 inches thick) 

 Cr--54 to 60 inches; slightly fractured tuff.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Meloza series. Meloza soils have argillic horizons to depths greater than 60 inches and are 30 to 60 inches deep to secondary carbonates. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Castlerock soils are on southerly facing structural benches and landslides at elevations of 2,750 to 3,650 feet. Slopes range from 4 to 35 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from tuff and volcaniclastic sediments. Average annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 16 inches. Average annual temperature ranges from 49 to 51 degrees F. Frost-free period is 130 to 150 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Adelmann, and Lockdown soils. Adelmann soils are very deep, noncalcareous and on similar geomorphic positions. Lockdown soils are cracked to the surface, do not have a mollic epipedon and are on similar, but eroded geomorphic positions. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Castlerock soils are used mainly for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The dominant natural vegetation is basin big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass and Thurber needlegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwestern Idaho. MLRA 11. Castlerock soils are not extensive.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
Mollic epipedon - zone 0 to 12 inches (A and Bt1 horizons)
Argillic horizon - zone 3 to 40 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Btk1 and Btk2 horizons)
Linear extensibility - 6.0 cm or more from the soil surface to 40 inches
Paralithic contact - at 54 inches (Cr horizon)

Particle-size control section - zone 3 to 23 inches
Soil moisture regime - aridic bordering on xeric
These soils are drier than other Xerolls in the region under similar precipitation due to early runoff and extended period of high evapotranspiration.
