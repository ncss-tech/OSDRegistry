CROOKEDRUN SERIES

The Crookedrun series consists of very deep somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium or lacustrine deposits.  These soils occur on flood plains, stream terraces, alluvial fans, fan remnants, drainageways and lakebeds.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Oxyaquic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Crookedrun silt loam, in rangeland on a 1 percent slope at an elevation of 2030 meters (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

   Oi--0 to 3 cm; undecomposed and partially decomposed matted roots; abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 8 cm thick)

   A1--3 to 13 cm; gray (10YR 5/1) silt loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine irregular pores; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear wavy boundary.   

   A2--13 to 38 cm; gray (10YR 5/1) silt loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine irregular pores; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); gradual wavy boundary. (combined thickness of A horizons - 18 to 40 cm)

   C--38 to 74 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silty clay loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; massive; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine tubular and irregular pores; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear smooth boundary.  (30 to 70 cm thick)  

   Cg1--74 to 124 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; few medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) redox concentrations; massive, hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; 5 percent gravel; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (30 to 70 cm thick) 

   2Cg2--124 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redox concentrations; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 30 percent gravel; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).
