CURTISVILLE SERIES

The Curtisville series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in till on moraines and till plains. Slope ranges from 12 to 55 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 711 mm (28 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, semiactive, frigid Haplic Glossudalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Curtisville sandy loam, on a south-facing, 24 percent slope in a pasture at an elevation of 244 meters (800 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated. When described on August 30, 1994, the soil was dry to 76 cm (30 inches) and moist below.)

 A--0 to 13 cm (5 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; friable; few fine roots; less than 5 percent gravel; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. [10 to 18 cm (4 to 7 inches) thick]

 E/B--13 to 25 cm (5 to 10 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sandy loam (E), pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; occupies about 80 percent of the horizon surrounding dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) sandy loam (Bt); moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common brown (10YR 4/3) worm channels and casts; less than 5 percent gravel; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. [0 to 15 cm (6 inches) thick]

 B/E--25 to 41 cm (10 to 16 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay loam (Bt); occupies about 60 percent of the horizon surrounded by brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam (E), very pale brown (10YR 7/3) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; common brown (10YR 4/3) worm channels and casts; less than 5 percent gravel; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. [10 to 18 cm (4 to 7 inches) thick]

 Bt--41 to 74 cm (16 to 29 inches); reddish brown (5YR 4/4) clay; strong medium angular blocky structure; firm; common faint brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; less than 5 percent gravel; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. [23 to 38 cm (9 to 15 inches) thick]

 BC--74 to 119 cm (29 to 47 inches); reddish brown (5YR 4/4) clay loam; moderate medium angular blocky structure; firm; few distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent gravel; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary.

 C--119 to 203 cm (47 to 80 inches); brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay loam; massive; friable; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Iosco County, Michigan; about 4 miles northwest of Whittemore; about 250 feet north and 2,400 feet east of the southwest corner of sec. 19, T. 22 N., R. 5 E., Reno Township; USGS Hale SE topographic quadrangle; lat. 44 degrees 16 minutes 39 seconds N. and long. 83 degrees 52 minutes 28 seconds W. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Depth to the argillic horizon: 23 to 41 cm (9 to 16 inches)
Depth to carbonates: 51 to 127 cm (20 to 50 inches)
Argillic horizon: averages 35 to 45 percent clay and 15 to 45 percent sand coarser than very fine sand; with a base saturation of 60 to 80 percent
Rock fragment content: 0 to 15 percent gravel throughout
Mean annual soil temperature: 7.2 to 8.3 degrees C (45 to 47 degrees F)

A horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 2, 2.5, or 3; 4 or 5 dry
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: sandy loam, loam, or clay loam
Reaction: moderately acid or slightly acid

E part of the E/B or B/E horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 5 or 6; 6 or 7 dry
Chroma: 2 or 3, moist or dry
Texture: sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam
Reaction: moderately acid or slightly acid

Some pedons have a separate E horizon.

Bt part of the B/E and the Bt horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam
Reaction: moderately acid to neutral

C horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 3 to 6
Chroma: 3 to 6
Texture: clay loam or silty clay loam
Clay content: 30 to 40 percent
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES:  These are Hottis and Mongo series. Hottis soils average more than 45 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Mongo soils average less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser sand in the particle-size control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Curtisville soils are on side slopes and ridges on moraines and dissected till plains. Slope ranges from 12 to 55 percent. The soils formed in loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 762 mm (28 to 30 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 5.6 to 7.2 degrees C (42 to 45 degrees F). Frost-free period is 120 to 130 days. Elevation is 244 to 366 meters (800 to 1,200 feet) above mean sea level

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Nester, Kawkawlin, and Sims soils. These soils are closely associated with the Curtisville soils in a drainage sequence. The moderately well drained Nester soils are on less sloping positions. The somewhat poorly drained Kawkawlin soils are on adjacent lower landscape positions. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Sims soils have cambic horizons and are on adjacent lower landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Potential for surface runoff is very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low. Permeability is slow.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Areas are used as pasture and a large part of the steeper slopes are forested. Common tree species include American basswood, American beech, sugar maple, quaking aspen, white ash, and northern red oak.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 94A in northern Lower Michigan. This series is of small extent.
