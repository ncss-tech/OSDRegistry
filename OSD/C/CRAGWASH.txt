CRAGWASH SERIES


The Cragwash series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium redeposited from tephra over outwash from volcanic rocks. Cragwash soils are on outwash plains.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cragwash soils are on outwash plains. Slopes are 1 to 30 percent. These soils formed in alluvium redeposited from tephra over outwash from volcanic rocks. Elevation is 5497 to 7255 feet (1676 to 2212 m). Mean annual precipitation is 39 to 93 inches (991 to 2362 mm). The mean annual temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F (4.5 to 6.5 degrees C). Frost free season is 60 to 85 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chaos and Sueredo soils. The Chaos soils are very deep and on rockfall avalanches from Chaos Crags. The Sueredo soils are very deep to dense till and are on adjacent moraines.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: well drained; saturated hydraulic conductivity is high to very high in the A, C, 2Ab, 2Bwb and 2Bqb horizons, and moderately low in the 2Bqmb horizon. 

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for wildlife habitat, recreation, ecosystem management and watershed. Vegetation is white fir, Jeffrey pine, ponderosa pine, western needlegrass and big squirreltail. California red fir occurs at higher elevations.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The soils are inextensive and are mapped in MLRA: 22B Southern Cascade mountains

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Shasta County, California. Source of name is coined from the concept that tephra from Chaos Crags eroded off of slopes and was redeposited on outwash plains.
