COLLEGECREEK SERIES

The Collegecreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils on toeslopes, fans and terraces of dissected plateaus. Collegecreek soils are formed in volcanic ash overlying colluvial and alluvial material derived from basalt. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy over loamy, glassy over mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Vitrixerands

TYPICAL PEDON: Collegecreek ashy loam, rangeland, on a 18 percent east-facing slope at an elevation of 2,400 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted. All textures are apparent field textures.)

Chuckanut soils - are 40 to 60 inches to a paralithic contact (sandstone); have 15 to 45 percent pararock fragments throughout the pscs; have an albic and Bs horizon

Reinecke soils - have 3 to 5 percent clay in the ash mantle; hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR in the lower particle-size control section; and are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice

Climate: cold, moist winters and hot, dry summers
Mean annual precipitation: 14 to 20 inches
Mean annual temperature: 47 to 50 degrees F.
Frost-free period: 95 to 200 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Doublecreek and Phys soils. Doublecreek soils are on adjacent stable terraces and benches and do not have andic soil properties in the upper 14 inches of the surface layer. Phys soils are on alluvial fans and terraces, are loamy-skeletal and do not have andic soil properties.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for watershed, wildlife habitat, livestock grazing and recreation. The native vegetation is Idaho Fescue, Sandberg's bluegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, rattlesnake brome, Japanese brome, prairie junegrass, lupine spp, arrow balsamroot, yarrow, Snake river phlox, western hawkweed, twin arnica, wild hyacinth, white stemmed frasers, cleavers, common spendwell and tonella brome.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Blue Mountains of Northeastern Oregon; MLRA 9. The soils are of limited extent.
