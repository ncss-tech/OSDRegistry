CAMPAIR SERIES 

The Campair series consists of soils that are moderately deep to sandstone bedrock. These well drained soils formed in loamy residuum derived from sandstone of Cambrian age. These nearly level to gently sloping soils occur on shoulders, backslopes and footslopes of ridges on dissected plateaus of the Central Basin. Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C (66 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 630 mm (25 in).  

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, siliceous, active, thermic Typic Haplustalfs

(Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 45 to 78 cm [18 to 31 in]) 

    R--86 to 111 cm (34 to 44 in); yellowish red (5YR 5/6) and red (2.5YR 5/6) coarse grained strongly cemented sandstone bedrock that contains about 15 to 20 percent imbedded fine siliceous gravel; cementation and shades of red staining mostly expressed in the upper 2.5 cm (1 in).
