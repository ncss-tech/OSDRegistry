SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Distribution: Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia
Extent: Large

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Hall County, Georgia; 1937.

REMARKS: 4/18/03, DTA. In 2003 version, moved the type location from Burke County, North Carolina to Halifax County, North Carolina. The former type location is located in the mesic part of MLRA 136. The 05/2006 revision removed MLRA 153B. RIC of Ap revised to allow silty clay loam texture.  The 12/2025 revision changed the format.  No data was changed.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 10 centimeters (0 to 4 inches) (Ap horizon)
Cambic horizon--the zone from 10 to 152 centimeters (4 to 60 inches) (Bw horizons)
Aquic conditions--the soil has redox depletions and concentrations within the upper 61 centimeters (24 inches) of the soil, with periodic saturation and reduction at some time during the year

ADDITIONAL DATA: None
