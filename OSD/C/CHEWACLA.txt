MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Hall County, Georgia; 1937. 

REMARKS: 4/18/03, DTA. In 2003 version, moved the type location from Burke County, North Carolina to Halifax County, North Carolina. The former type location is located in the mesic part of MLRA 136. The 05/2006 revision removed MLRA 153B. RIC of Ap revised to allow silty clay loam texture.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 4 inches (Ap horizon)
Cambic horizon--the zone from 4 to 60 inches (Bw horizons)
Aquic conditions--the soil has redox depletions and concentrations within the upper 24 inches of the soil, with periodic saturation and reduction at some time during the year
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches
