TYPE LOCATION: Del Norte County, California; located approximately 50 meters south of Kellog Road; HBLM, USGS Crescent City Quadrangle; WGS84 Decimal degrees 41.8688889 latitude; and -123.1913889 longitude; UTM Zone 10 401135mE 4635920mN; NAD83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 12 to 15 degrees C (54 to 59 degrees F).  The difference between the mean winter and mean summer soil temperatures varies from 6 to 9 degrees C.  The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 10 to 30 centimeters (4 and 12 inches) in the four months following the summer solstice.  

Umbric epipedon is 30 to 100 centimeters (12 to 39 inches) thick.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Horeb series. Horeb soils have a frost-free period of less than 165 days.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Carlotta soils are on fluvial terraces. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Elevations are 3 to 32 meters (10 to 105 feet).  The climate is humid, characterized by warm wet winters and warm moist summers with fog.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F).  The mean annual precipitation is 1520 to 2030 millimeters (60 to 80 inches).  The frost-free period is 275 to 325 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ferndale, Tsunami, and Weott soils.  Ferndale soils are fine-silty. Tsunami soils do not have redoximorphic features in the upper 100 centimeters. Weott soils have redoximorphic feature within 10 centimeters of the soil surface. Ferndale soils are on nearby low floodplain steps. Tillas soils are higher up on fluvial terraces. Weott soils are on floodplains.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained; low runoff; moderately low to high saturated hydraulic conductivity; flooding rare.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The soils are used mainly for pasture.  Native vegetation is redwood, grand fir, Sitka spruce, California laurel, red alder, willow, bigleaf maple, and salmonberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Coastal Redwood Belts; MLRA 4B. The series is of small extent.
