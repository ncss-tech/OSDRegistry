CANDERLY SERIES

The Canderly series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in stratified glacio-lacustrine deposits on terraces.  Slope is 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Ultic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Canderly sandy loam - nearly level orchard.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Ap--0 to 7 inches;  very dark brown (10YR 2/2) sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; medium acid (pH 6.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 8 inches thick)

    A--7 to 15 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; many fine and very fine tubular pores; medium acid (pH 5.6); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 15 inches thick)

    Bw1--15 to 30 inches; dark brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few medium and coarse roots; many very fine tubular pores; medium acid (pH 6.0); gradual smooth boundary.  (10 to 20 inches thick)

    Bw2--30 to 46 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; medium acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 20 inches thick)

    C--46 to 60 inches; stratified dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) loamy sandy and coarse sandy loam; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; medium acid (pH 6.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Clackamas County, Oregon; at north city limit of Canby; 100 feet west and 50 feet south of intersection of Canby Ferry Road and Territorial Road in the southeast 1/4 southwest 1/4 southwest 1/4, sec.  28, T 3 S., R 1 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is usually moist but is dry throughout between a depth of 12 and 36 inches for 45 to 90 consecutive days during the summer.  The mean annual soil temperature is 54 to 56 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Depth of sola is more than 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  It is medium acid or slightly acid.

The A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.

The Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  It has 10 to 18 percent clay.

The C horizon is stratified loamy sand, coarse sandy loam or gravelly loamy sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 20 percent gravel.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Catelli, Crouch, Spokane, Usk and Wind River series.  Catelli soils have sola less than 40 inches thick.  Crouch soils are dry for more than 90 consecutive days during the summer.  Spokane soils have a paralithic contact at 24 to 40 inches.  Usk soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Wind River soils have sola less than 40 inches thick and a mean annual soil temperature of 50 to 54 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Canderly soils are on terraces at elevations of 120 to 250 feet.  Slope is 0 to 8 percent.  The soils formed in stratified glacio-lacustrine deposits.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and warm dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 50 inches and the mean annual temperature is 52 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 165 to 210 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Latourell and Quatama soils.  Latourell and Quatama soils have an argillic horizon and have greater than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Quatama soils are moderately well drained.  Latourell soils are well drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; slow runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Canderly soils are used for vegetable crops, nursery stock, specialty crops and urban development.  Native vegetation is Douglas-fir, western hazel, trailing blackberry, and grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western part of the Cascade Mountains, Oregon.  The series is inextensive.
