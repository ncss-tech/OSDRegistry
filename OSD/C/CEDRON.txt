REMARKS: This revision in 2006 changes the type location of this series. 
Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:
Mollic epipedon: from a depth of 0 to 30 cm 
Some pedons meet mollic criteria by being 18 to 25 centimeters thick (after mixing the upper 18 cm of mineral soil) and one-third or more of the total thickness between the mineral soil surface and the upper boundary of any identifiable secondary carbonates. 
Calcic horizon: from a depth of 30 to 157 cm 
Calcium carbonate equivalent, weighted average in particle size control section: about 50 percent
Particle size control section: from a depth of 25 to 100 cm
Soil temperature regime: Cryic
Soil moisture regime: Aquic
