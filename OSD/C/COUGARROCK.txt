COUGARROCK SERIES

The Cougarrock series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on backslopes of mountains. Cougarrock soils formed in volcanic ash mixed with colluvium overlying  residuum weathered from andesitic tuff breccia or basalt.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches and mean annual temperature about 40 degrees F.
