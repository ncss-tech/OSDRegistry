COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Okaloacoochee series.
Okaloacoochee soils have mineral soil materials at greater than 130 centimeters (51 inches) of the surface and occur on similar landform positions.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: Herbaceous organic material over sandy marine sediments
Landscape: Lower Coastal Plains, Atlantic and Gulf Coast
Landform: Low tidal marshes and swamps 
Mean annual temperature: 25 to 27 degrees C (77 to 81 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 1143 to 1524 millimeters (45 to 60 inches)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  
Carbon Beach soils, are calcareous throughout, have a sapric horizon about 15 centimeters (6 inches) thick. The subsurface layer dark gray to grayish brown fine sand about 188 centimeters (74 inches) thick.
Trout Cove soils have limnic materials about 109 centimeters (43 inches) thick. At depth of 109 centimeters (43 inches) is a layer of fractured limestone. Depth to limestone presence can range from 100 to 150 centimeters (40 to 60 inches).
Okaloacoochee soils are on similar positions, have black muck surface about 163 centimeters (64 inches) thick. The substratum is very dark gray to dark gray sand at about 163 centimeters (64 inches) to a depth of about 204 centimeters (80 inches).
Perrine soils consists of limnic soil materials and limestone rock at 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches).

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  
Drainage class: Very poorly drained.
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (KSAT): high to very high
Permeability: rapid
Surface Runoff: negligible to very low
Depth to seasonal high water table: 0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches) of the surface.
Surface Water: can range from 15 to 122 centimeters (6 to 48 inches) during the raining season (June to November). During the months of December and January surface water can range from 15 to 91 centimeters (6 to 36 inches).  During the dry season February to May surface water ranges from 15 to 76 centimeters (6 to 30 inches).  
Flooding, tidal: surface water ranges from 0 to 122 centimeters (0 to 48 inches). 

USE AND VEGETATION:  
Major uses: water quality and wildlife habitat.
Dominant vegetation: Forested areas may include but are not limited to red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle), black mangrove (Avicennia germinans), white mangrove (Laguncularia racemosa) and button mangrove (Conocarpus erectus). Non-Forested areas may include but are not limited to various species of cordgrass (Spartina spp.), needlegrass rush (Juncus roemerianus), salt grass (Distichlis spicata), and various flowering forbs. Changes in salinity (ppt) is often the main driver between different major zones of vegetative species in both forested and non-forested areas.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Everglades and Associated Areas (MLRA 156A)
Extent: limited

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE:  Auburn, Alabama.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Collier County, Florida, 2023.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon:

1. Histic epipedon - 0 to 91 centimeters (0 to 36 inches) (Oan1, Oan2, Oan3 horizons)
2. Mineral soil material contact - 91 to 203 centimeters (36 to 80 inches) (Cgn horizon)
3. Sulfur presence - 0 to 203 centimeters (0 to 80 inches) (Oan1, Oan2, Oan3, Cgn horizons)
4. Aquic conditions - 0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches)
5. Endosaturation - 0 to 203 centimeters (0 to 80 inches)
6. Tidal flooding daily by normal high tides.

This series was formerly mapped as tidal marsh and/or Wulfert. Temperature regime changes required a new soil series for the isohyperthermic area in MLRA 156A.
