COY SERIES

The Coy series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that developed in calcareous clayey alluvium derived from mudstone. These soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping terrace remnants and broad flats associated with drainage ways. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.7 degrees C (71 degrees F).
