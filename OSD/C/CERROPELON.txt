CERROPELON SERIES

The Cerropelon series consists of moderately deep well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Cerropelon soils are on hills. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

Bowbac and Cushman soils are more moist in the moisture control section in May and June.
Gapbutte, Gapmesa, Hagerman, and Hagerwest soils have a lithic contact at depths between 20 and 40 inches. 
Pokeman soils have secondary accumulations of gypsum. 
Pugsley and Spangler soils are noncalcareous throughout. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cerropelon soils are on shoulder and backslope positions on sedimentary bedrock controlled hills. They formed in loamy slope alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,400 to 7,100 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Penistaja and Skyvillage soils. Penistaja soils are deep. Skyvillage soils do not have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; high surface runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Cerropelon soils are used for livestock grazing and recreation. The historic climax vegetation is blue grama, Gamble's oak, mountain mahogany, twoneedle pinyon, and oneseed juniper.  The ecological site is Sandstone Hills(R036XB122NM)..

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Cerropelon soils are of small extent on the northern Galisteo Basin part of the Mexican Highlands section of the Basin and Range province in north central New Mexico. The MLRA is 36.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Santa Fe County, New Mexico; Santa Fe Area Soil Survey Update; 2008.  The name Cerropelon is taken from a hill in Santa Fe County and its associated ranch.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon  0 to 1 inches. (A horizon)
Argillic horizon - The zone from 1 to 21 inches. (Bt1, Bt2, and Btk horizons)
Secondary carbonates - 12 to 28 inches (Btk and BCk horizons)
Particle-size control section  from 1 to 21 inches (entire argillic horizon)
Paralithic contact  at 28 inches (Cr layer)

Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Calcium carbonate equivalence was determined using a calcimeter. Electrical conductivity was determined by ec meter, 1:1 water. pH was determined by pH meter 1:1 water. Texture was determined by hydrometer method.
