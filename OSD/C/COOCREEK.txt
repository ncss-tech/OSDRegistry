COOCREEK SERIES

The Coocreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils on hills.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from reddish colored sedimentary rocks.  slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.  The frost free period is 85 to 110 days.  Elevation is 6,000 feet to 6,700 feet.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Coocreek loam, in an area of Byrnie-Coocreek-Byrnie, this solum Complex, 0 to 15 percent slopes in rangeland.  (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)
