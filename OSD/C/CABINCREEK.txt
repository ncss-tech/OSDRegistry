CABINCREEK SERIES

Cabincreek series consists of deep, well-drained soils on north aspect canyon slopes of dissected plateaus. They formed in mixed volcanic ash and loess over colluvium from metavolcanic bedrock. Slopes are 60 to 90 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual temperature about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Vitrandic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Cabincreek ashy sandy loam - on an 85 percent planar northeastfacing slope at 2,000 feet in elevation. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 A1--0 to 10 inches; black (10YR 2/1) ashy sandy loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; weak to moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual smooth boundary. (8 to 22 inches thick)

 A2--10 to 20 inches; black (10YR 2/1) ashy sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) dry; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; few fine irregular and common fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual smooth boundary. (10 to 13 inches thick)

 2AB--20 to 28 inches, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), gravelly sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; few fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual smooth boundary. (8 to 18 inches thick)

 2BC--28 to 42 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) dry; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; 20 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt irregular boundary. (8 to 20 inches thick)
