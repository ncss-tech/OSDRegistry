CHICKENHILL SERIES

The Chickenhill series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from interbedded sandstone and shale. These soils occur on hills. Slopes are 10 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 340 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 5.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Calciustepts 

TYPICAL PEDON: Chickenhill loam, in rangeland (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A--0 to 9 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, and few fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine dendritic tubular pores; 10 percent subangular gravel; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 15 cm thick)

     Bw--9 to 22 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine and few fine dendritic tubular pores; 10 percent subangular gravel; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 15 cm thick)

     Bk1--22 to 41 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) gravelly loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; few medium and fine roots and common very fine roots; common very fine and few fine dendritic tubular pores; 15 percent subangular gravel; 3 percent, fine, light gray (10YR 7/2), irregular, carbonate masses, in matrix, and finely disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary.

     Bk2--41 to 66 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) gravelly loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine dendritic tubular pores; 20 percent subangular gravel; 5 percent fine light gray (10YR 7/2) irregular carbonate masses in matrix, and finely disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (combined thickness of Bk1, Bk2 horizons - 40 to 75 cm)

     C--66 to 200 cm; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; massive; 20 percent light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) mottles; moderately hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine dendritic tubular pores; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).
