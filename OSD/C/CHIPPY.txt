CHIPPY SERIES

The Chippy series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess influenced slope alluvium and alluvium derived from non-calcareous sedimentary rock. Chippy soils are on hillslopes and fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 16 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 650 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature is about 1.7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-Loamy, mixed, superactive Xeric Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Chippy loam, on an east-facing, 4 percent slope in sagebrush at an elevation of 2,021 meters.  When described on October 27, 2015, the soil was moist in the upper part and dry in the lower part. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 A1--0 to 8 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, and common fine and medium roots; many very fine and common fine irregular pores; 2 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.

 A2--8 to 19 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, and common fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary.

 Bt3--89 to 132 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, very sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 20 percent prominent clay films on all faces of peds, 5 percent prominent clay films on surfaces along pores, 50 percent distinct clay bridges between sand grains and 5 percent prominent clay films on rock fragments; 45 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.3); clear wavy boundary. 

 Bt4--132 to 150 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) moist; weak very coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common fine tubular pores; 10 percent faint clay films on all faces of peds and 5 percent faint clay films on surfaces along pores; 5 percent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist, concretions (Fe and Mn oxides) lining pores; 25 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4).
