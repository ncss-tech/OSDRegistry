CALABASAS SERIES

The Calabasas series consists of well drained soils that are deep to duripan.  Calabasas soils formed in eolian material derived from loess, volcanic ash, and pumice; and alluvium derived from loess and basalt.  They are on summits of mesas and erosional fan remnants.  Slopes are 1 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  At present, there are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Calabasas soils are on summits of mesas and erosional fan remnants.  They formed in eolian material derived from Quaternary loess, volcanic ash, and pumice and alluvium derived from loess and Tertiary basalt.  Slopes are 1 to 3 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,800 to 6,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Tetilla and Zepol soils.  Tetilla soils have calcic horizons below 40 inches, do not have cemented pans, and occur on summits of erosional fan remnants.  Zepol soils have thick mollic epipedons and occur on narrow flood plains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; low surface runoff; moderately slow permeability in the subsoil, moderately rapid permeability in the substratum, and very slow permeability in the duripans.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Calabasas soils are used for urban development, livestock grazing, and recreation.  The historic climax vegetation is blue grama, galleta, ring muhly, black grama, sand dropseed, three awn, and onseed juniper.  The ecological site is Cinder(R036XB117NM).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:   North-central New Mexico.  MLRA 36. The soils are of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Santa Fe County, New Mexico, 1970.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 4 inches. (A horizon)
Argillic horizon: The zone from 4 to about 25 inches. (Bt, Btk1, and Btk2 horizons)
Calcic horizon: The zone from 32 to about 49 inches. (Bkq horizon)
Duripan: The zone from 49 to about 54 inches and from 70 to about 81 inches. (Bkqm and B'kqm horizons)
Petrocalcic horizon: The zone from 49 to about 54 inches. (Bkqm horizon)

Note:  This soil has minor amounts of volcanic glass in either the coarse silt or very fine sand fractions within 75 cm of the soil surface.  It is assumed that most of the volcanic glass derived from nearby Pleistocene ash eruptions has altered to more stable minerals like chalcedony.  In addition, Lincoln lab data indicates that ammonium oxalate extractable aluminum and iron percentages are very low.  Calabasas soils thus do not have the properties of the andic intergrades.

The 11/2006 revision moves the type location to the typical pedon used in the update soil survey of the Santa Fe Area. The series concept was also changed from a very deep soil with a cambic horizon to one with a duripan at 40 to 60 inches and an argillic horizon. The classification of Calabasas when established was fine-silty, mixed, mesic Ustollic Camborthids. The soil at the new type location was provisionally proposed as the Cuerbio series in 1996 before being dropped and correlated with Calabasas in 2006.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  The type location has been sampled for full characterization by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S92NM-049-002.
