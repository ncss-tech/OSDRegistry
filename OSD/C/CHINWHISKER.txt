CHINWHISKER SERIES

The Chinwhisker series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits on stream terraces, outwash plains, and lake terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 7.2 degrees C (45 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, frigid Lamellic Oxyaquic Haplorthods

TYPICAL PEDON: Chinwhisker sand, on a 2 percent slope in a wooded area. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

 A--0 to 5 cm (2 inches); black (N 2.5/) sand, gray (N 5/) dry; weak fine granular structure; friable; many fine and common medium roots; strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [0 to 5 cm (3 inches) thick]

 E--5 to 8 cm (2 to 3 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sand; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many fine roots; strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [2 to 23 cm (1 to 9 inches) thick] 

 Bs1--8 to 20 cm (3 to 8 inches); dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) sand; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine and medium roots; about 1 percent gravel; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. [10 to 18 cm (4 to 7 inches) thick] 

 Bs2--20 to 53 cm (8 to 21 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) sand; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; about 1 percent gravel; moderately acid; abrupt wavy boundary. [13 to 38 cm (5 to 15 inches) thick] 

 E'1--53 to 64 cm (21 to 25 inches); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sand; single grain; loose; few fine roots; moderately acid; abrupt broken boundary. 

 E'2--64 to 91 cm (25 to 36 inches); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sand; single grain; loose; few fine roots; common fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [Combined thickness of the E' horizon is 0 to 51 cm (20 inches) thick] 

 E and Bt--91 to 203 cm (36 to 80 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) sand (E) and brown (7.5YR 4/4) loamy sand (Bt); which occurs as lamellae 2 mm to 2 cm (1/16 to 3/4 inch) thick with total accumulation of 10 cm (4 inches); single grain; loose; common fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron; about 1 percent gravel; slightly acid.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Chinwhisker soils are on stream terraces, lake terraces, and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. These soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 813 mm (28 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 to 8.3 degrees C (43 to 47 degrees F). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Klacking, Graycalm, Mancelona, and McGinn soils. Klacking, Graycalm and Mancelona soils occupy positions higher on the landscape than the Chinwhisker soils and formed in stratified outwash or glaciolacustrine deposits. McGinn soils formed in loamy sand till. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The depth to the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from 61 to 152 cm (2 to 5 feet) between September and June in normal years. Potential surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of this soil is forested. Common tree species are bigtooth aspen, quaking aspen, red maple, paper birch and jack pine. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 90A, 94A, and 96 in northern lower peninsula of Michigan and northwestern Wisconsin. The series is of moderate extent.
