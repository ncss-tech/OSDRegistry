CORTEZ SERIES

The Cortez series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in a surficial mantle of loess and volcanic ash over alluvium derived from mixed volcanic and sedimentary rocks.  Cortez soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Flue series.  Flue soils have Bq horizons formed in the lower part of the eolian mantle and have thin horizons high in carbonates between the natric horizon and the duripan.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cortez soils are on fan remnants.  These soils formed in a surficial mantle of loess and volcanic ash over alluvium derived from mixed volcanic and sedimentary rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.   Elevations range from 1,370 to 1,890 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cherry Spring, Chiara, Orovada, and Tomera soils.  Cherry Spring soils are fine-loamy and have a duripan that is not indurated.  Chiara soils lack argillic horizons and are shallow to indurated duripans.  Orovada soils are coarse-loamy and have cambic horizons.  Tomera soils lack duripan and are very deep.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high surface runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Cortez soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, Douglas rabbitbrush, basin wildrye, bottlebrush squirreltail, Sandberg bluegrass, mustard, cheatgrass, and other annuals.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  The series concept and main acreage is in MLRA 25, while other acreage occurs in MLRA 24.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Eureka County, (Tuscarora Mountain Area.) Nevada, 1979.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 13 cm (A1 and A2 horizons).
Vitrandic intergrade feature - The zone from the soil surface to 25 cm (A1, A2, and BAtn horizons).
Abrupt textural change -The boundary at 25 cm (Between the BAtn and 2Btnss horizons).
Natric horizon - The zone from 25 to 56 cm (2Btnss and 2Btnk horizons).
Identifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 38 to 122 cm (2Btnk and 2Bqkm horizons).
Duripan - The zone from 56 to 122 cm (2Bqkm horizon).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 56 cm (2Btnss and 2Btnk horizons).

The revision of November 2007 updated the taxonomic class from Fine, smectitic, mesic Xeric Natridurids based on the parent material for the eolian mantle and laboratory data on sand mineralogy for adjacent soils.  Volcanic glass contents and oxalate extractable aluminum and iron values in the A horizons are estimated.

The BAtn horizon does not qualify as an argillic horizon nor is it part of the natric horizon because it lacks the required increase in clay content.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has characterization data by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Riverside, CA as soil survey sample number S66NV-011-002 (pedon # 40A3167).  The data is published in Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 23 on pages 38-39.  Soil pH values in the typical pedon were determined in a soil-water (1:10) solution.
