CYFAIR SERIES

The Cyfair series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy sediments derived from the Lissie Formation of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level soils are on coastal prairies.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent, but most are less than 0.5 percent due to leveling.  Mean annual temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1118 mm (44 in).

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Austin County, Texas, 2017. The name is coined but refers to the 
Cypress-Fairbanks area in Harris County, Texas.

REMARKS: The series was formerly included in the Aris and Katy series. Aris soils 
have aquic conditions. Katy soils are better drained.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: 45 to 95 cm (18 to 38 in) 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 45 cm (0 to 18 in) (A and E horizons) 
Argillic horizon: 45 to 203 cm (18 to 80 in) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and Bt4 horizons)

Additional Comments: The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is 
supported by laboratory data number S2017TX0152005 from Austin County, Texas.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Particle-size analysis, salinity and sodicity tests were 
performed at the project office on twelve pedons.
