06/2016--Assumed to meet criteria 2 (no ash required) for andic soil properties, in the 12th edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy. It is also assumed that enough ash is present for the soils to meet criteria 3. Additional lab data is needed to confirm the degree of ash influence. Samples should also be collected to determine if this series meets the criteria for the Alic Hapludand or Eutric Hapludand subgroup.
