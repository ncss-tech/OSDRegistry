CRISTO SERIES

The Cristo series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils. These soils formed in material weathered from shale and limestone on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 10 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Pachic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cristo loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Oi--0 to 5 cm; organic matter, leaves, stems, etc.

    A1--5 to 18 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak fine and medium granular structure; friable, slightly sticky and plastic; many fine, very fine, and few medium roots; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 15 cm thick)

    A2--18 to 38 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure that parts to weak fine and medium granular; hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; common fine, very fine, few medium and coarse roots; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 20 cm thick)

    Bt--38 to 56 cm; dark brown (10YR 3/3) gravelly silty clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, sticky and very plastic; common very fine, fine, few medium and coarse roots; common very fine and few fine pores; many moderately thick clay films of faces of peds; 25 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.3); abrupt smooth boundary.  (20 to 33 cm thick)

    C/B--56 to 94 cm; dark brown (10YR 3/3) extremely gravelly silty clay loam, (pockets of silty clay loam adhering to soft shale fragments), grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; ped size and shape determined by space available between soft shale fragments but dominantly weak, medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, sticky and very plastic; few very fine and medium roots; many moderately thick clay films on faces of peds; 85 percent shale fragments; moderately calcareous; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4) boundary (18 to 36 cm thick).

    Cr--94 to 156 cm; fractured shale.
