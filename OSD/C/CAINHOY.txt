CAINHOY SERIES

The Cainhoy series consists of very deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in sandy marine sediments. These soils have slopes ranging from 0 to 10 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Thermic, coated Typic Quartzipsamments

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cainhoy fine sand--forested.                 (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A--0 to 5 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sand; single grained; loose; many fine and medium roots; salt and pepper appearance because of white sand grains; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 9 inches thick)

     Bw1--5 to 12 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) fine sand; single grained; loose; common fine and medium roots; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.

     Bw2--12 to 43 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) fine sand; single grained; loose; common medium roots; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary.

     Bw3--43 to 55 inches; yellow (10YR 7/6) fine sand; few fine faint very pale brown mottles; single grained; loose; few medium roots; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bw horizon is 16 to 80 inches)

     E1--55 to 65 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) fine sand; few fine faint yellow mottles; single grained; loose; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

     E2--65 to 81 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) fine sand; few medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) mottles; single grained; loose; moderately acid; gradual irregular boundary.

     E3--81 to 110 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sand; single grained; loose; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the E horizon is 28 to 66 inches)

     Bh--110 to 130 inches; black (5YR 2/1) fine sand; single grained; weakly cemented, loose when crushed; moderately acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Berkeley County, South Carolina; 6.0 miles southwest of Cainhoy on S-08-33; site is 100 feet north of highway.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the upper boundary of the E horizon ranges from 50 to 80 inches.  Depth to the Bh horizon is more than 80 inches.  The soil is very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout the profile.

The A horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is loamy fine sand, sand, or fine sand.

The Bw horizon has a hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is loamy fine sand, sand, or fine sand.

The E horizon has a hue of 10YR to 5Y or neutral, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is fine sand or sand.

The Bh horizon has a hue of 5YR to 10YR or neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is fine sand or sand.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alaga, Alpin, Arenosa, Bigbee, Catpoint, Darden, Foxworth, Glentosh, Lakeland, Tonkawa and Wando series in the same family and Blanton, Chipley, Echaw, Kureb, and Rimini series in closely related families.  None of these soils except Kureb, Echaw, and Rimini have E horizons that are underlain by Bh horizons.  Alaga, Lakeland, and Wando soils do not have lower horizons with chroma 2 or less.  Alpin and Catpoint soils have lamella.  Arenosa soils have an ustic moisture regime.  Bigbee, Blanton, Chipley, and Foxworth soils have a seasonal high water table.  Blanton soils also have a Bt horizon.   Kureb, Echaw, and Rimini soils have Bh horizons at less than 80 inches from the surface.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cainhoy soils are on nearly level to sloping landscapes in the Lower Coastal Plain.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent.  The soils formed in sandy marine sediments.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 45 to 55 inches, mean annual temperature ranges from 65 to 70 degrees F., and freeze-free season ranges from 240 to 250 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the similar Blanton, Chipley, and Echaw series and the Leon, Osier, Pickney, Plummer, Rutlege, and Witherbee series.  Leon and Witherbee soils have Bh horizons within 30 inches of the surface.  Osier, Pickney, Plummer, and Rutlege soils are wetter and have low chroma matrices.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Excessively drained.  Runoff is slow.  Permeability is rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of this soil is in woodland.  Native vegetation is longleaf pine, live oak, post oak, white oak, bluejack oak, turkey oak, persimmon, and southern red oak.  A small acreage is cleared and is used for growing soybeans, corn, small grain, and pasture grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Lower Coastal Plain of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.  The series is of moderate extent.
