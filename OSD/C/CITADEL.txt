CITADEL SERIES

The Citadel series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum
and local alluvium from calcareous sandstone, limestone, and soft shale on
mountains.  They have moderately slow or slow saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C, and the mean annual precipitation is about 610 mm.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium to very high runoff, depending on slope; moderately low or moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for timber production, recreation and wildlife, homesite and urban development, and for grazing.  Native vegetation is dominantly ponderosa pine with lesser amounts of Black Hills spruce, aspen, birch, and bur oak.  Understory species include prairie dropseed, needlegrass, western wheatgrass, roughleaf ricegrass, and little bluestem.  Shrubs include bearberry, oregon-grape, common juniper, hophorn bean, and snowberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Low Limestone Plateau physiographic area of the Black Hills in western South Dakota and northeastern Wyoming; LRR G, MLRA 62.  The series is extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Meade County, Southern Part, South Dakota, 1974.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon - 4 to 21 cm; (A and E horizons)
Argillic horizon - 21 to 128 cm; (Bt/E, Bt1, Bt2, Btk1, and Btk2 horizons)

The typical pedon for the series is changed to one which was sampled for complete characterization and meets the current classification.  The classification of the series is changed from Glossic Hapludalfs to Typic Hapludalfs because the color requirements for an albic horizon were not previously met.
