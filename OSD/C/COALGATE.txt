COALGATE SERIES

The Coalgate series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in sodic reclaim materials from coal strip mines.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on strip mines in the Arkansas Ridges and Valley land resource area.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 56 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 43 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, active, nonacid, thermic Alfic Udarents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Coalgate very fine sandy loam, 2 percent slope, pastureland.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Ad--0 to 6 inches; dark brown (10YR 4/3) very fine sandy loam; massive and platy structure; very hard, friable; slightly acid, clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 15 inches thick)

    Cd1--6 to 42 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) gravelly clay loam; massive structure; extremely hard, very firm; 15 percent fragments of sandstone less than 76mm across; common distinct light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) and yellowish red (5YR 4/6) mottles; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (12 to 46 inches thick)

    Cd2--42 to 76 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) silty clay loam; massive structure; extremely hard, firm; common distinct dark brown (10YR 4/3), light brownish gray (10YR  6/2) and yellowish red (5YR 4/6) mottles; 10 percent fragments of sandstone less than 76mm across; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (20 to 60 inches thick)

    Cr--76 to 80 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) shale; churned and hard.

TYPE LOCATION:  Haskell County, Oklahoma; 1400 feet west and 1500 feet south of the northeast corner of Section 5, T.9N., R.21E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to unconsolidated bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The exchangeable sodium percentage throughout the profile is greater than 15.  Fragments of sandstone and shale less than 76mm across range from 0 to 35 percent throughout the profile.

The Ad horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 and chroma of 2, 3, or 5.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, or loam.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to moderately akaline.

The Cd horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4, 5, 6 or 7 and chroma of 1, 2, 4 or 6.  Texture is clay loam or silty clay loam.  It is mottled in shades of red, brown, and gray.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to moderately alkaline.

The Cr horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 4, and chroma of 0.  It is shale.

COMPETING SERIES:  These include the tentative Ironbridge and Latimer series in the same family.  Soils in similar families include the tentative Whitefield, Emachaya and Lequire soils.  Ironbridge soils are less than 60 inches deep over shale material.  Latimer soils are subject to flooding.  Whitefield, Emachaya and Lequire soils do not have natric horizons.  In addition, Lequire and Whitefield soils are less than 40 inches deep over shale material.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Coalgate soils are on nearly level to gently sloping areas of strip mines in the Arkansas Ridges and Valley land resource area.  These soils are formed from the premine soils of the Counts and Wing series.  The average annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 45 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the competing tentative series Ironbridge and Latimer soils and the similar tentative series Emachaya, Whitefield and Lequire soils.  Ironbridge soils are on similar positions as Coalgate soils but are less than 60 inches deep over shale material.  Latimer soils are on flood prone areas and are greater than 60 inches over shale.  Emachaya, Whitefield and Lequire soils are on similar positions but do not have sodic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is slow to moderate.  Permeability is very slow.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for pastureland.  Vegetation is bermuda grass, love grass, or plains bluestem.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Oklahoma and Arkansas.  The series is not extensive with less than 500 acres.
