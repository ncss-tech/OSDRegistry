CREF SERIES

The Cref series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone, limestone, and quartzite.  Cref soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 559 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4.4 degrees C.
