CHESTERVILLE SERIES

The Chesterville series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits derived from igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rock of the Lissie Formation.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are pimple mounds on flats on coastal plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent from the top of the mound to the base which is about 15 m (50 ft). Mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (69 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm (43 in).

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Colorado County, Texas, 2017. The name is from a community near 
the type location.

REMARKS: The series was formerly included in the Katy and Telf series. The series 
was separated based on geomorphic position.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: 74 to 124 cm (29 to 49 in)  
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 74 cm (0 to 29 in) (A1, A2, E horizons) 
Argillic horizon: 74 to 203 cm (29 to 80 in) (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons) 

Additional Comments: The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is from 
supported by soil survey office laboratory data on pedon number S2017TX089400 
Colorado County, Texas.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Particle-size analysis, salinity and sodicity tests were 
performed at the project office on 8 pedons.
