CORLEY SERIES

The Corley series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately permeable soils formed in loess in depressions on uplands and high stream benches. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 29 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Argiaquic Argialbolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Corley silt loam, on a concave slope of less than 1 percent, in a cultivated field, at an elevation of 1,000 feet above sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 10 inches; black (10YR 2/1) silt loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; moderate medium granular structure; friable; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.

 A--10 to 18 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silt loam, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; moderate fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; friable; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizon is 8 to 20 inches.)

 E--18 to 29 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) silt loam, light gray (10YR 7/1) dry; weak thick platy structure; friable; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. (6 to 12 inches thick)

 Bt--29 to 36 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silt loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; friable; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. (6 to 10 inches thick)

 Btg1--36 to 47 inches; dark gray (5Y 4/1) silty clay loam; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; firm; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; dark stains along root channels; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.

 Btg2--47 to 60 inches; dark gray (5Y 4/1) silty clay loam; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; firm; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; dark organic stains along root channels; few fine prominent light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Btg horizon is 20 to 28 inches.)

 Cg--60 to 68 inches; olive gray (5Y 5/2) silt loam; massive; friable; few fine prominent light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; neutral.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Marshall, Minden, and Monona soils.
Marshall--are at the lower landscape positions or at the slightly higher landscape positions, do not have eluvial horizons, and do not have a seasonally saturated zone within a depth of 6 feet
Minden--are at the slightly higher landscape positions, do not have eluvial horizons, and have a seasonally saturated zone within a depth of 1 to 3 feet
Monona--are at the lower landscape positions or at the slightly higher landscape positions, do not have eluvial horizons, and do not have a seasonally saturated zone within a depth of 6 feet

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage class--poorly drained--a saturated zone occurs within a depth of 1 foot during April to June in most years and is considered apparent
Permeability--moderate
Surface runoff potential--negligible
Ponding--unless artificially drained, these soil pond up to 1 foot of water above the surface for long periods during late winter and spring in most years and after heavy precipitation events

USE AND VEGETATION:
Where drained, these soils are cultivated. Principal crops are corn, legume hays, small grains, and soybeans. The native vegetative cover is a herbaceous wetland community commonly inhabited with Bluejoint Grasses, Fowl Bluegrasses, Green Muhlies, Fox Sedges, Field Sedges, Dudleys Rushes, Torreys Rushes, Swamp Milkweeds, False Sneezeweeds, False Asters, New England Asters, White Panicled Asters, and Wild Mints.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
LRR= M, MLRA 107; western Iowa. This series is of small extent.
