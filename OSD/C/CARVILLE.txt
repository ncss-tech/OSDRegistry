COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Carville soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping natural levee positions on flood plains along the Mississippi River and its distributaries. The soil formed in recent loamy alluvium. Most areas are protected from flooding by levees. The climate is humid temperate. Elevation ranges from 1 to 8 meters (3 to 25 ft) above mean sea level. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 18 to 24 degrees C (65 to 75 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 1397 to 1778 mm (55 to 70 in). Annual frost free days range from 235 to 350.
 
GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cancienne, Vacherie and Gramercy series. Cancienne soils have a fine-silty control section. Gramercy soils have a fine control section. Vacherie soils have a clayey discontinuity beginning at a depth of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 in) deep. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained; low to negligible runoff; moderate saturated hydraulic conductivity. The soil is saturated in all layers below depths of 30 to 76 cm (12 to 30 in) from December through June in normal years. It stays saturated within a depth of 76 cm (30in) for periods of up to 1 month duration in normal years. Flooding frequency ranges from none to common.
 
USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas have been cleared and are primarily used for sugarcane, small grain, soybeans, corn, truck crops, pasture, and hay crops. The native forest vegetation in uncultivated areas is predominantly oaks, cottonwood, hickories, and sweetgum with an undergrowth of vines and canes.
 
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Mississippi River Alluvium in south-central Louisiana. The series is of small extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: AUBURN, ALABAMA

SERIES ESTABLISHED: The series was proposed for the update of St. John the Baptist Parish, Louisiana in 2001. The series was established by an Amendment to the Correlation of St. Mary Parish, Louisiana in 8/2002. Carville soils were formerly included in the Convent series. 

REMARKS: The classification was changed from a Fluvaquentic subgroup to a Fluventic subgroup in 2004 according to 9th ed. Keys to Soil Taxonomy. The reaction class was also changed from nonacid to calcareous based on data from the type location and supporting pedons, and a study of other supporting sites in St. John the Baptist Parish. The type location pedon was sampled for full characterization analyses by NSSL, Lincoln, Ne. (S02-LA095-003).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
Ochric epipedon...... 0 to 33 cm (0 to 13 in) (Ap horizons)
Cambic horizon........ 15 to 33 cm (6 to 13 in) (Ap2 horizon)
Irregular organic carbon decrease... 0 to 127 cm (0 to 50 in)(C and Cg horizons)
Free carbonates.......0 to 71 cm (0 to 28 in) (Ap, C1, and C2 horizons)
Aquic conditions......saturation, reduction and redoximorphic features (including chroma 2 matrix) within a depth of 51 cm (20 in).
