COOPER SERIES

The Cooper series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on flood plains. These soils formed in 20 to 30 inches of silty alluvium and the underlying clayey alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 29 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty over clayey, mixed, superactive, mesic Fluvaquentic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Cooper silty clay loam, on a slope of about 1 percent, on a flood plain, in a cultivated field, at an elevation of 975 feet above sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 8 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky and granular structure; friable; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.

 A--8 to 16 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; neutral; gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizons is 10 to 20 inches.)

 Bg--16 to 24 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (6 to 12 inches thick)

 2Ab--24 to 33 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silty clay; strong fine subangular blocky structure; very firm; few calcium carbonate concretions; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 13 inches thick)

 2Cg--33 to 60 inches; olive gray (5Y 4/2) silty clay; olive gray (5Y 5/2) coatings on faces of some peds; massive with vertical cleavage; very firm; many calcium carbonate concretions; few fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) redoximorphic concentrations; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material--20 to 30 inches of silty alluvium and the underlying clayey alluvium
Landform--flood plains
Slopes--0 to 2 percent
Elevation--700 to 1,200 feet above sea level
Mean annual air temperature--47 to 53 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation--25 to 32 inches
Frost-free period--140 to 160 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Blencoe, Blend, Keg, Luton, and Salix soils.
Blencoe--are at the slightly lower elevations and have 18 to 24 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section
Blend--are in similar landscape positions to those of the Cooper soils and have a saturated within a depth of 1 foot during March to June in most years
Keg--are at the higher elevations and have 18 to 26 percent clay in the particle-size control section
Luton--are at the lower elevations and have 40 to 75 percent clay in the upper part of the particle-size control section
Salix--are at the slightly higher elevations and have 16 to 22 percent clay in the lower part of the particle-size control section

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage class--somewhat poorly drained--a saturated zone occurs within a depth of 1 to 3 feet during April to June in most years and is considered apparent
Permeability--moderate in the upper part and slow in the lower part
Surface runoff potential--low
Flooding--rarely flooded for brief periods during the months of February to November resulting from precipitation events and snowmelt

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are cultivated. Corn and soybeans are the principal crops. Some areas are irrigated. The native vegetation is big bluestem, indiangrass, switchgrass, and other grasses of the tall grass prairie.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
LRR M, MLRA 107; along the Missouri River about midway between the river channel and the upland foot slopes in Iowa and possibly adjoining states. This series is of small extent.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 10 to 40 inches (A, Bg, 2Ab, and 2Cg horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 60 inches (Ap, A, Bg, 2Ab, and 2Cg horizons);
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 16 inches (Ap and A horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 16 to 24 inches (Bg horizon);
udic moisture regime.
Cation-exchange class is inferred from lab data for similar soils in the surrounding area.
Taxonomy version--Second Edition, 1999.

The classification of the Cooper series has been changed from Aquic Hapludolls to Fluvaquentic Hapludolls because the typical pedon has a buried mollic horizon below a cambic horizon.
