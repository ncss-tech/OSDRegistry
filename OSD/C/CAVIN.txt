CAVIN SERIES

The Cavin series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and colluvium derived from volcanic and pyroclastic rocks.  Cavin soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Ashy-skeletal, glassy, frigid Vitritorrandic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cavin very gravelly ashy sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is partially covered with 45 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles.

    C1--46 to 61 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly ashy sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine interstitial and tubular pores; 40 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual wavy boundary.

    2C2--61 to 152 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) extremely cobbly ashy very fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; no roots observed; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 35 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles, and 2 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.2)

TYPE LOCATION:  Washoe County, Nevada; on the south flank of Fox Mountain; approximately 1,400 feet east and 2,250 feet south of the northwest corner of section 7, T. 36 N., R. 22 E.; USGS Fox Mountain 7.5 minute quadrangle; latitude 41 degrees 00 minutes 56.7 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 33 minutes 11.6 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 41.0157778 latitude, -119.5533056 longitude.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cinderfall, Crackedground, Nutzan, and Wildcatbutte series.

Cinderfall soils are dominated by gravel-size basaltic cinders in the lower part of the particle-size control section and have identifiable secondary carbonates at depths of 50 to 76 cm from the soil surface.  Crackedground soils are deep to lithic contacts.  Nutzan soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Wildcatbutte soils have soil reaction of neutral or slightly alkaline throughout the epipedon and have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates at depths of 60 to 100 cm from the soil surface.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cavin soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on shoulder and backslope positions with dominantly south-facing aspects.  They formed in volcanic ash and colluvium derived from volcanic and pyroclastic rocks.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,460 to 2,445 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 360 to 460 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 60 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ashtre, Hutchley, and Zorromount soils and the competing Nutzan soil.  Ashtre soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts and have argillic horizons.  Hutchley soils are shallow to lithic contacts.  Zorromount soils are cryic.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium or high surface runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Cavin soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is dominantly mountain big sagebrush, Idaho fescue, needlegrass, bluegrass, and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Nevada and northeastern California.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 23.
