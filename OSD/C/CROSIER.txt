CROSIER SERIES

The Crosier series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in till on till plains and moraines. They are moderately deep to dense till. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Aeric Epiaqualfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Crosier loam, on a 1 percent slope in a cultivated field at an elevation of 260 meters (852 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; friable; 1 percent gravel; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. [15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 inches) thick]

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Aubbeenaubbee, Baugo, Haskins, Lamberjack, and Shebeon series. Aubbeenaubbee soils are deeper than 102 cm (40 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Baugo soils average more than 60 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Haskins soils have more than 25 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Lamberjack soils have more than 10 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Shebeon soils are typically less than 61 cm (24 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon and typically less acidic in the upper and middle parts of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Crosier soils are on swells on till plains and moraines of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Crosier soils formed in loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 864 to 1067 mm (34 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.3 to 11.7 degrees C (47 to 53 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 185 days. Elevation is 183 to 466 meters (600 feet to 1,530 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Barry, Brookston, Miami, Riddles, Wawasee, and Williamstown soils. The poorly drained Barry and Brookston soils are in depressions on till plains and moraines. The moderately well drained Miami soils and the well drained Riddles and Wawasee soils are on narrow summits, shoulder slopes, and backslopes of dissected till plains and moraines. The moderately well drained Williamstown soils are on narrow summits and backslopes of dissected till plains. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm (0.5 to 1.5 feet) for some time in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the subsoil and moderately low or low in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the subsoil, moderately slow in the lower part of the subsoil, and slow or very slow in the underlying dense material. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Soils are used to grow corn, soybeans, and small grain (wheat and oats). Some areas are used for hay and pasture. A few areas are in woods. Native vegetation is deciduous forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 97, 98, 111B, 111C, and 111D in Indiana and Michigan. The series is of large extent.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 28 cm (11 inches) (Ap, Eg horizons).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 28 to 76 cm (11 to 30 inches) (Btg, Bt horizons).
Aquic conditions: clay depletions or clay films with chroma of 1 in horizons between 20 to 96 cm (8 and 38 inches) (Eg, Btg, Bt, BC horizons).

NASIS Data Mapunit ID 124261 represents the typical pedon.
NASIS Data Mapunit ID 124262 represents the 1 to 4 percent slope phase.
NASIS Data Mapunit ID 154984 represents a fine sandy loam surface phase.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Lab characterization data is available for the typical pedon (S70IN-71-5-(1-6)) from the Purdue University Soil Characterization Lab. Lab characterization data is also available from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE. Transect data (T99IN-141-001) is on file in MLRA project office, Plymouth, Indiana. Transect shows 80 percent Crosier and similar soils, 10 percent Aubbeenaubbee soils, and 10 percent Williamstown soils.
