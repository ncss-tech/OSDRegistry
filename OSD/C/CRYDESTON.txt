CRYDESTON SERIES

The Crydeston series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived primarily from sedimentary sources.  Crydeston soils are in mountain valleys.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 710 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 7.0 degrees C.

Frost-free period:  60 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Gillum (T)  and Jenksdraw (T) -have a mollic epipedon less than 41 centimeters thick; these soils occur on higher slopes than Crydeston soils
Marshbrook - are poorly and very poorly drained; they occur on toeslopes in lower drainageways

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderately high to saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Crydeston soils are in grassland and utilized for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Most areas are dominated by timothy, smooth bromegrass, and minor remnant native species.  The native vegetation includes
several species of wheatgrass, needlegrass, and bluegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Crydeston soils occur in the High Limestone Plateau physiographic area of the Black Hills of South Dakota and Wyoming; LRR G, MLRA 62; the series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Denver, Colorado

SERIES PROPOSED:  Extension revision of the Soil Survey of Lawrence County, South Dakota. 2007. The name is a derivative of the similar Cordeston soil, found at lower elevations in the Black Hills.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Soil moisture: Typic-udic.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 25 to 100 cm  (AB, Bw1, and Bw2 horizons)
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 125 cm  (A1, A2, AB, Bw1, Bw2, 2A/Btb horizons)
Argillic horizon:  The zone from 125 to 192 cm  (Btb horizon)
Paralithic contact:  The contact with weakly cemented limestone at 192 cm  (Cr horizon)
Lithologic discontinuity:  At the upper boundary of the 2A/Btb horizon. 
Other features:  A buried A horizon typically occurs between depths of 96 and 114 cm

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
