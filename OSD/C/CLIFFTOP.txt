MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Fayette County, West Virginia, 2009. 

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 20 cm (Oi, A and BA horizons)
Argillic horizon(s)--the zone from 20 to 64 cm (Bt horizon)
The clay mineralogy is mixed, with kaolinite dominant and illite and vermiculite in lesser quantities.
This series is proposed to cover areas in MLRA 127 and 125 previously mapped as Gilpin or Muskingum in published and out-of-date surveys. Gilpin is among the most extensive series in MLRAs 124, 125, 126, and 127 and is mapped on a variety of geologic parent materials. The Clifftop series will be limited to soils formed in materials weathered from early Pennsylvanian Period geologic parent materials (members of the Pottsville Group or its analogue).
