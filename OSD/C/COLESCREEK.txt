SERIES ESTABLISHED: Franklin County, Virginia, 2004

REMARKS: Colescreek soils were previously mapped as Dillard and Elsinboro soils. Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0  to 9 inches (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 9 to 50 inches (Bt and Btg horizons)
Oxyaquic conditions--the soil has redox depletions and concentrations within the 40 inches of the soil surface, with periodic saturation and reduction at some time during the year
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches

ADDITIONAL DATA: This pedon sampled as S99VA067-010.
