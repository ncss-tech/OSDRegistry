SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Currituck County, North Carolina; 1980.

REMARKS:
This series is mapped in areas previously mapped as fresh water tidal marsh. Values for fiber content, pH, moist incubation pH, and electrical conductivity are based on laboratory data from N.C. State University, Department of Crop and Soil Sciences.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include--
Histosols (Terric)--have organic materials that total 40 cm or more between the soil surface and a depth of 50 centimeters and total thickness of organic materials does not exceed 130 centimeters in depth - the zone from a depth of 0 to 118 cm (Oese, Oase1, Oase2, Oase3, Oase4).
Hemic soil materials--the zone from the soil surface to 8 centimeters (0 to 3 inches). (Oese horizon)
Sapric soil materials--the zone from 8 to 118 centimeters centimeters (3 to 43 inches). (Oase1 and Oase2 horizons)
Peraquic conditions--continuous endosaturation with very frequent tidal flooding.
Hyposulfidic soil materials--sulfurous odors and incubated pH decrease greater than 1.0 unit and remains above 4.0, the zone from the soil surface to 200 centimeters.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Reference data is available from N.C. State University.
