CHINASPRINGS SERIES 

The Chinasprings series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in vocanic ash influenced alluvium over volcanic and sedimentary rock. These soils are on alluvial fans, hills and escarpments.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy, glassy, frigid Vitrandic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Chinasprings gravelly sandy loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 6 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) gravelly ashy sandy loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel and 2 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt--6 to 20 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly ashy sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; few medium tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 15 percent gravel and 2 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual smooth boundary. (6 to 15 inches thick)

    Bk--20 to 44 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly ashy sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and common fine roots; few medium tubular pores; 25 percent gravel and 2 percent cobbles; common fine masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (15 to 25 inches thick)

    BCk--44 to 58 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly ashy sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and common fine roots; few medium tubular pores; 20 percent gravel and 1 percent cobbles; common fine masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (15 to 25 inches thick)

    Cr--58 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) semiconsolidated tuff that crushes to silt loam.

COMPETING SERIES: 

This is the Carett series. Carett soils are moderately deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - alluvial fans, hills, and escarpments
Elevation - 5,100 to 6,100 feet.
Slope - 2 to 30 percent.
Parent material - volcanic ash influenced alluvium.
Climate - long, cold winters; cool, moist springs; warm summers.
Mean annual precipitation - 12 to 16 inches.
Mean annual air temperature - 40 to 43 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 70 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Travona series. Travona soils do not have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Chinasprings soils are used mainly for rangeland.  Potential native vegetation is chiefly mixed grasses, such as bluebunch wheatgrass, rough fescue and Idaho fescue with some areas of widely scattered Douglas fir.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Chinasprings soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic  horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: a mollic epipedon from the surface to 7 inches (A horizon); an argillic horizon from 6 to 20 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons); a horizon of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation from 20 to 58 inches; a paralithic contact at 58 inches (Cr horizon); a particle size control section from 6 to 20 inches (Bt horizon).  Chinasprings soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
