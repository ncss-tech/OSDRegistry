COLIBRO SERIES

The Colibro series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in erosional calcareous loamy material of Quaternerary age. These nearly level to moderately steep soils are on ancient alluvial terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (70 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, carbonatic, hyperthermic Typic Calciustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Colibro sandy clay loam, on an east-facing,  convex, 5 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 107 m (350 ft) (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)
