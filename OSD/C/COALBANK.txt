COALBANK SERIES

The Coalbank series consists of deep and very deep, well drained moderately rapidly permeable soils that are formed in alluvium and residuum from weakly consolidated volcanic ash.  They are on mesa sides, mountain sides, hill sides, and terraces and have slopes of 4 to 75 percent.  The average annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C. and the average annual precipitation is about 360 mm.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy, glassy, frigid Vitrandic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Coalbank ashy fine sandy loam - rangeland.  On a 42 percent smooth slope, north aspect, 1,555 meter elevation.  (The profile was dry to 10 inches and moist below.  Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.  This profile was described on August 7, 1980.)

    A1--0 to 8 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) ashy fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5 with phenol red, and 7.0 with sodium fluoride); abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to 20 cm thick)

    A2--8 to 25 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) ashy fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and common fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5 with phenol red, and 7.1 with sodium fluoride); clear smooth boundary.  (13 to 25 cm thick)

    Bw1--25 to 36 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) ashy fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse and very coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5 with phenol red, and 7.1 with sodium fluoride); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 25 cm thick)

    Bw2--36 to 53 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) ashy fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak very coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6 with phenol red, and 7.1 with sodium fluoride); gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 25 cm thick)

    C1--53 to 117 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) ashy fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6 with phenol red, and 7.0 with sodium fluoride); clear smooth boundary.  (25 to 64 cm thick)

    C2--117 to 140 cm; light gray (5Y 7/1) ashy fine sand, olive gray (5Y 4/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 25 to 35 percent medium and coarse plates of Cr material that are hard and firm; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7 with phenol red, and 6.8 with sodium fluoride); abrupt smooth boundary.  (23 to 56 cm thick)

    Cr--140 to 165 cm; light gray (N 7/0) weakly cemented volcanic ash, gray (5Y 7/1) moist; massive; very thick plates can be broken out which are hard and firm; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8 with phenol red and 6.8 with sodium fluoride).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cottonthomas and Trailcreek series.  Cottonthomas soil have a Bk horizon.  Trailcreek soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Coalbank soils are on mountain slopes, hillslopes, and terraces.  Slopes range from 4 to 75 percent.  Elevation ranges from 1,465 to 1,830 meters.  The soil formed in alluvium, colluvium and residuum from weakly consolidated volcanic ash.  Average annual precipitation is about 300 to 460 mm and the average annual air temperature is about 5.6 to 7.2 degrees C.  Frost-free season is 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Hardister, Tomsherry, and the competing Cottonthomas and Trailcreek soils.  Hardister soils are mesic.  Tomsherry soils have a duripan up to 50 to 100 cm.  Hardister soils are on valley floors.  Tomsherry and Cottomthomas soils are on fan terraces.  Trailcreek soils are on convex sideslopes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; runoff is medium; moderately rapid saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Coalbank soils are used for rangeland.  The natural vegetation is mountain big sagebrush, Idaho fescue, prairie junegrass, and needleandthread.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southcentral Idaho and inferred in northwestern Utah and northeastern Nevada.  This series is not extensive in Idaho. MLRA 25.
