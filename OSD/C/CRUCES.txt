CRUCES SERIES 

The Cruces series consists of very shallow and shallow to a petrocalcic, well drained soils that formed in sandy alluvial and eolian sediments from mixed sources. Cruces soils are on broad basin floors with slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic, shallow Argic Petrocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Cruces loamy sand - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Bkm1--14 to 25 inches; pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) alternating layers of laminar carbonate and massive calcium carbonate cemented material, pink (7.5YR 8/4) and pink (7.5YR 7/4) moist with some parts pink (7.5YR 7/4), light brown (7.5YR 6/4) and brown (7.5YR 5/4); extremely hard; reddish brown and red stains along cracks; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary. 

    Bkm2--25 to 40 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) and pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) calcium carbonate-cemented material, light gray (10YR 7/2) and pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) moist; massive; extremely hard; sand grains separated by calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy to irregular boundary.

    Ck1--40 to 90 inches; white (10YR 8/1) sandy loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist; matrix is massive and soft; many indurated, extremely hard calcium carbonate nodules; calcium carbonate coatings on nodules and sand grains; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Mormount (NV) series.  Mormount soils are in the Mohave Desert (MLRA 30) receive mostly winter precipitation and are usually dry from April through November.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cruces soils are on broad, basin floors and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The soils formed in thick basin-fill deposits that usually contain much sand.  Elevations range from 3,100 to 5,500 feet.  Mean annual precipitation is 7 to 11 inches with a pronounced summer maximum.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 57 degrees to 65 degrees F.  The frost-free period ranges from 180 to 220 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bucklebar, Tonuco, Tencee, Dona Ana, Pintura, and Simona soils.  Bucklebar and Dona Ana soils do not have petrocalcic horizons.  Simona, Tencee, and Tonuco soils do not have argillic horizons.  Pintura soils do not have argillic horizons and have sandy textures throughout. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation is snakeweed, mesquite, and a few yucca, and in places, there is scattered clumps of dropseed, black grama, and tobosa grass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern New Mexico.  The series is of moderate extent.  MLRA is 42.

Classified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999

This series represents an identified soil within the Desert Soil-Geomorphology Project, Las Cruces, New Mexico.  The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment.  The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.  Revision outside the project area is discouraged in order to preserve the historical concept for research.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data are available for sample number S61NM7-7(1-12) (L.H. Gile and R.B. Grossman, 1979. The Desert Project Soil Monograph. Document PB80-135304. National Technical Information Service, Springfield, VA.)
