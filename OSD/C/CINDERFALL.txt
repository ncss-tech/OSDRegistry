CINDERFALL SERIES

The Cinderfall series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over basaltic cinders. Cinderfall soils are on lava plains. Slopes are 1 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-skeletal, glassy, frigid Vitritorrandic Haploxerolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Cinderfall ashy loamy sand--on a sloping plain at an elevation of 1,330 meters--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. When described on September 11, 2000, the soil was dry throughout.)

   2Cqk--53 to 157 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely gravelly ashy sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; massive; soft; slightly sticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; few very fine interstitial pores; 20 percent very pale brown (10YR 7/3) medium and coarse sand-size pumiceous ash grains; 65 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; few fine coats of opaline silica on tops of rock fragments; very slightly effervescent; secondary carbonates occurring as common fine coats on the tops and bottoms of rock fragments; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (56 to 114 cm thick) 

   2Ck--157 to 173 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely gravelly ashy fine sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; single grain; loose; nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; about 35 percent very pale brown (10YR 7/3) medium to very coarse sand-size pumiceous ash grains; 70 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; secondary carbonates occurring as common fine coats on rock fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cavin, Crackedground, Nutzan, and Wildcatbutte series. 

Cavin soils have soil reaction of moderately acid or slightly acid in the epipedon, do not have basaltic cinders in the lower part of the particle-size control section, and do not have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates. Crackedground soils are deep to lithic contacts and are dominated by stones in the particle-size control section. Nutzan soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts. Wildcatbutte soils are dominated by cobbles in the particle-size control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cinderfall soils are on lava plains. They formed in volcanic ash over basaltic cinders. Slopes are 1 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 1,310 to 1,390 meters. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 280 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Abert, Kunceider, Lapham, and Morehouse soils. Abert soils are ashy, sodium-affected, and have ochric epipedons and cambic horizons. Kunceider soils are shallow to lithic contacts. Lapham soils are ashy over loamy-skeletal. Morehouse soils have ochric epipedons and have ashy loamy sand or ashy loamy fine sand textures to 100 cm. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; low surface runoff; moderately rapid permeability: high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Cinderfall soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mountain big sagebrush, needleandthread, Idaho fescue, and western needlegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Oregon. These soils are not extensive with about 900 acres of the series mapped to date. MLRA 23.
