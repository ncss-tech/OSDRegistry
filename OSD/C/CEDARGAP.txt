CEDARGAP SERIES 

The Cedargap series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium with a high content of chert fragments.  These soils are on flood plains of small streams near active channels.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 41 inches. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Cumulic Hapludolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Cedargap gravelly silt loam - on a 2 percent slope in pasture at an elevation of 1,280 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

   Ap--0 to 8 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) gravelly silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak very fine granular structure; very friable; many fine roots; 20 percent chert gravel and 5 percent chert cobbles; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizon is 6 to more than 24 inches).

   Bw1--8 to 25 inches; black (10YR 2/1) very gravelly silt loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; many fine roots; 35 percent chert gravel and 10 percent chert cobbles; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. 

   Bw2--25 to 35 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) extremely gravelly silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; very friable; common black manganese oxides on some surfaces of peds and chert fragments; few fine roots; 65 percent chert gravel and 10 percent chert cobbles; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bw horizon containing mollic colors ranges from 0 to 35 inches).

   Bw3--35 to 46 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) extremely gravelly silty clay loam; weak fine granular structure; friable; few fine roots; 60 percent chert gravel and 10 percent chert cobbles; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bw horizon containing non-mollic colors ranges from 0 to 36 inches) 

   C--46 to 60 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) and grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely gravelly clay loam; massive; firm; 65 percent chert gravel and 10 percent chert cobbles; neutral. 

TYPE LOCATION: Wright County, Missouri; about 3 miles north and 2 miles east of Mansfield; 2,540 feet south and 460 feet west of the northeast corner, sec. 35, T. 29 N., R. 15 W; USGS Mansfield NE quadrangle, latitude 37 degrees 09 minutes 36 seconds N. and longitude 92 degrees 32 minutes 25 seconds W. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Depth to Bedrock: greater than 60 inches
Thickness of mollic epipedon: 24 to more than 60 inches
Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly acid.
Note: Rock fragment content in the 10 to 40 inch zone averages 35 to 85 percent and clay percentage ranges from 18 to 30 percent. Individual horizons can contain 15 to 85 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.

A or Ap horizon
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 2 or 3
Chroma: 1 to 3
Fine-earth: silt loam, loam, sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam
Rock fragments:  3 to 70 percent, predominantly gravel size

Bw horizon 
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 3 to 6
Chroma: 1 to 6
Fine-earth: loam, silt loam, sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, and sandy clay loam
Rock fragments:  15 to 80 percent

C, 2C or 2Bw horizons (where present)
Hue: 5YR to 2.5Y
Value: 2 to 7
Chroma: 1 to 8
Fine-earth: silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay, sandy clay, and clay
Rock fragments: 30 to 85 percent 

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Woolly series. Woolly soils have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cedargap soils are on flood plains of small streams near active channels.  The parent material consists of cherty alluvium.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bearthicket, Claiborne, Clarksville, Crider, Doniphan, Goss, Union, Viraton, and Waben soils.  Bearthicket soils have an argillic horizon and are on slightly higher landscape postions. Claiborne and Waben soils have argillic horizons and are on foot slopes or stream terraces.  Clarksville, Crider, Doniphan, and Goss soils have argillic horizons and are on uplands.  Union and Viraton soils have fragipans and are on uplands. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained.  Runoff is negligible to low. Permeability is typically moderate, but the clayey substratum phase is moderately slow. The saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.  These soils are subject to very brief to brief flooding.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in pasture or woodland.  Native vegetation was tall prairie grass.
 
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Ozarks region (MLRA 116A and 116B) and adjacent areas of Missouri.  The series is of large extent.
