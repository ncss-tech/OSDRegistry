CHIPETA SERIES

The Chipeta series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in slope alluvium and/or colluvium derived from sedimentary rocks over residuum from shale.  Chipeta soils are on pediments and hills and have slopes of 0 to 50 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, mixed, active, calcareous, mesic, shallow Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Chipeta silty clay loam - cultivated.  (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 Ap--0 to 5 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few medium and fine roots; few fine discontinuous pores; violently effervescent (19 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are finely disseminated; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 5 inches thick)

 C--5 to 13 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, very firm, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few medium and fine roots; few coarse continuous pores, few fine discontinuous pores; violently effervescent (15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are finely disseminated; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 12 inches thick)

 Cy--13 to 17 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) parachannery silty clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak, moderately thick platy structure parting to weak medium angular blocky structure; hard, very firm, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few medium and fine roots; many fine crystals and dendritic veins of gypsum; 30 percent parachanners; violently effervescent (14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are finely disseminated; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual irregular boundary.  (0 to 8 inches thick)

 Cr--17 inches; weathered calcareous marine shale.

TYPE LOCATION:  Emery County, Utah; 1 mile south and 1.5 miles east of Castle Dale, 1,000 feet south and 20 feet east of the northwest corner, sec. 11, T. 19 S., R. 8 E.; lat. 39 degrees 11 minutes 16 seconds N. and 111 minutes 0 minutes 1 second W., NAD 27.

Electrical conductivity:  greater than 2 mmhos/cm.
Particle-size control section: 35 to 50 percent clay.
Reaction: slightly alkaline to very strongly alkaline.

A horizon:
Hue: 10YR to 5Y
Value: 5 to 8 dry, 3 to 6 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, gravelly clay loam

C and Cy horizon:

Value: 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma:  1 to 4
Textures:  clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, parachannery silty clay loam, parachannery silty clay, very parachannery silty clay loam

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  The similar Chipenhill series has a superactive CEC class and gypsum content of 10 to 30 percent in the C horizons.  The similar Hanksville series is moderately deep to weathered shale.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on gently sloping to steep upland pediments and hills.  Slopes are complex and range from 0 to 50 percent.  These soils formed in slope alluvium and/or colluvium derived from sedimentary rocks over residuum from alkaline marine shale containing gypsum.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 55 degrees F.  The freeze-free period ranges from 90 to 160 days.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 5 to 11 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Killpack, Persayo, and Libbings soils.
Killpack soils:  have fine-silty particle-size control sections.
Persayo soils:  have loamy particle-size control sections.
Libbings soils:  have a salic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to very high runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  A few of the smoother areas of deeper soil are irrigated and used for growing grain and hay crops.  Potential vegetation is mat saltbush and galleta.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Colorado, Wyoming, eastern Utah, and New Mexico.  LRR D, MLRA 34.  The series is extensive.
