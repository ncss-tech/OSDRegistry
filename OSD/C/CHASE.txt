CHASE SERIES

The Chase series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained and moderately well drained, soils that formed in alluvium on floodplains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 86 centimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (56 degrees F).
