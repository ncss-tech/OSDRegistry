CAMPWOOD SERIES

The Campwood series consists of soils that are very deep, well drained soils formed in calcareous clayey alluvium derived from limestone of Cretaceous age. These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping stream terraces and alluvial plains in footslope positions of valleys on dissected plateaus. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in).

Indiahoma soils: Formed in Permian age sediments, have linear shaped microhighs and have cooler mean annual soil temperature.
Irion soils: are in depressions and have indurated platy limestone at 150 to 200 cm (60 to 80 in)
Kingco soils: Have mixed mineralogy.
Leeray soils: Have SAR of 8 to more than 15 within 100 cm (40 in) of the surface.  
Lockney soils: Are moderately well drained, formed in eolian sediments playa basins of the High Plains, and have cooler mean annual soil temperature.
Roscoe soils: Occur in flat to slightly depressional areas, are moderately well drained and have cooler mean annual soil temperature.
Teagard soils: Are less than 100 cm (40 in) thick over claystone.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: Calcareous clayey alluvium derived from limestone and deposited during and since the Pleistocene age. 
Landscape: Dissected plateaus
Landform: stream terraces and on alluvial plains in footslope positions 
Slope: 0 to 5 percent 
Climate: Dry subhumid
Soil moisture: Typic ustic moisture regime
Precipitation Pattern: The majority of the yearly amount occurs during the fall and spring months. The winter and summer months are normally drier.
Mean annual air temperature: 18 to 21 degrees C (65 to 70 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 610 to 711 mm (24 to 28 in)
Frost-free days: 207 to 262 days
Elevation: 305 to 610 m (1,000 to 2,000 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dev (TX), Dina (TX), Eckrant (TX), Kerrville (TX), Oakalla (TX), Real (TX), Tarrant (TX) and Valera (TX) series.
Dev and Oakalla soils: Occur at lower elevations on flood plains and do not have vertic properties.
Dina, Eckrant, Kerrville, Real and Tarrant soils: Are on summits, shoulders, and backslopes of ridges of the Lower Cretaceous.
Valera soils: are on similar positions on footslopes of hills and ridges in valleys.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained.  Permeability is slow. Runoff is very low on less than 1 percent slope, low on 1 to 3 percent slopes, and medium on 3 to 5 percent slopes. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Mostly in rangeland.  The remainder is used for cropland  or wildlife. The major crops are forage sorghums and small grains. The climax plant community is a tall grass prairie.  The dominant grass is little bluestem. Other plants include sideoats grama, vine mesquite, yellow Indiangrass, big bluestem, Canada wildrye, live oak, silver bluestem, Texas wintergrass, cane bluestem, hairy wedelia, Texas cupgrass, tall dropseed, and plains lovegrass.  The dominant forbs include Maximilian sunflower, Engelmann daisy, and bushsunflower. The woody plants include elm, live oak, hackberry, bumelia, green briar and elbowbush. With heavy stocking rates, the site could potentially deteriorate to a plant population of tumblegrass, hairy tridens, Texas grama, red threeawn, western ragweed, broomweed, prairie coneflower, and Ashe juniper. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwest Plateaus and Plains Range and Cotton Region, LLR I: MLRA 81B-Edwards Plateau, Central Part and MLRA 81C-Edwards Plateau, Eastern Part. This series is of moderate extent.
