COMITAS SERIES

The Comitas series consists of very deep, well drained soils. These nearly level to undulating soils formed in eolian sands over eolian deposits and alluvium of the Sand Sheet Prairie. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 584 mm (23 in).

Nueces soils: occur on similar positions.
Sarita soils: have sandy surface horizons more than 102 cm (40 in) thick and occur on slightly higher positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  Runoff is negligible on slopes less than 1 percent, very low on 1 to 5 percent slopes, and low on 5 to 8 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland, wildlife habitat, pasture, and cultivated land.  Crops grown include peanuts, watermelons and grain sorghums.  Native vegetation consists of tanglehead, trichloris, hooded windmillgrass, sand lovegrass, tasajillo, mesquite, prickly pear, and live oak. The ecological site is Loamy Sand 25-35 PZ(R083EY705TX)
