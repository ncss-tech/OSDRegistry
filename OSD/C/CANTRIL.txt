CANTRIL SERIES

The Cantril series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy local alluvium and/or colluvium.  These soils are on base slopes on dissected till plains and alluvial fans.  Slope ranges from 0 to 9 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 950 millimeters.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 43 to 93 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 43 centimeters (Ap, E, and BE horizons);
albic horizon--the zone from a depth of 20 to 30 centimeters (E horizon);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 43 to 140 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and Bt4 horizons);
aquic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
