COBLEN SERIES

The Coblen series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy alluvium on stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Coblen soils are on treads on low stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in loamy alluvium. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 838 to 1016 mm (33 to 40 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Rossburg, Sligo, Sloan, and Stringley soils. Rossburg soils are well drained and are on flood plains and low terraces. Stringley soils are well drained and Sligo soils are moderately well drained and are on adjacent flood plains. Sloan soils are very poorly drained and are in depressions on flood plains.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent high water table ranges from 46 to 91 cm (1.5 to 3.0 feet) between January and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate. Subject to rare flooding.

USE AND VEGETATION: Coblen soils are cultivated. Corn and soybeans are the principal crops. Some areas are pastured.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwestern Ohio; MLRAs 111D and 114A. The type location is in MLRA 111D. The series is of small extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Clinton County, Ohio 1999.

REMARKS: This soil was previously mapped as Medway. There are preliminary indications that Medway in other nearby correlated surveys will be in the coarse-loamy (not fine-loamy) family.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon: from surface to depth of 43 cm (Ap, A horizons).
Cambic horizon: from a depth of 43 to 124 cm (Bw, Bkg horizons).
Aquic conditions: redoximorphic features indicating wetness starting at 53 cm.
Fluventic properties: irregular decrease in organic carbon.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data for this soil is available through the Soil Characterization Laboratory, Ohio State University, pedon CT-84.
