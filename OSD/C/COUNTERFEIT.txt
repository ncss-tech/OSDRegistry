COUNTERFEIT SERIES


The Counterfeit series consists of very deep soils that formed from human transported material (HTM) which originated from material weathered from calcareous sedimentary rocks. Counterfeit soils are on man-made terraces and risers with slopes ranging from 0 to 5 percent on treads and up to 65 percent on risers. The mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 17 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, spolic, smectitic, calcareous, thermic Typic Xerorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Counterfeit clay loam, on a terraced hillside. When described the soil was moist throughout.

 ^Au--0 to 13 cm; clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), moist; strong medium granular structure; friable, moderately sticky, very plastic; finely disseminated carbonate; common flat angular channers; slight effervescence; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); channers are from road-base and crushed paralithic bedrock; abrupt wavy boundary (8 to 26 cm).

 ^Cu1--13 to 46 cm; clay, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3), moist; massive; firm, very sticky, very plastic;  common distinct pressure faces; common medium distinct irregular strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), masses of oxidized iron and common medium distinct irregular light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), iron depletions; common distinct carbonate masses in matrix; common channers; few artifacts; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); channers are from road-base and crushed paralithic bedrock, calcium carbonate masses are geogenic from the source material; abrupt wavy boundary.

 ^Cu2--46 to 95 cm; clay, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4), moist; massive; firm, very sticky, very plastic; many pressure faces; common medium distinct irregular yellowish brown (10YR 5/6), masses of oxidized iron and common medium distinct irregular light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), iron depletions; few channers; few artifacts; strong effervescence; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); channers are from road-base and crushed paralithic bedrock; abrupt wavy boundary.

 ^C1--95 to 145 cm; clay loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4), moist; firm, very sticky, very plastic; pressure faces; common medium prominent irregular yellowish red (5YR 4/6), masses of oxidized iron; common irregular pale brown (10YR 6/3), carbonate masses; common para-channers; strong effervescence; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); channers are from crushed paralithic bedrock, calcium carbonate masses are geogenic from the source material abrupt wavy boundary.

 ^C2--145 to 183 cm; sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6), moist; massive; friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common coarse distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6), masses of oxidized iron and common medium distinct gray (2.5Y 6/1), iron depletions; slight effervescence; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0) (combine thickness of the ^C(u) horizons is 145 to 192 cm).

TYPE LOCATION: Los Angeles County, Arroyo Park; Walnut, CA; 125 feet south of hillslope terrace on 2nd tier, 34 degrees North latitude, 1 minutes, 18 seconds and 117 degrees, 52 minutes, 19 seconds West longitude, NAD83 - U.S.G.S Quad: San Dimas, California.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil Moisture: The soil becomes moist below a depth of about 30 cm some time from October to December and remains moist in some part between depths of about 30 to 90 cm until April or May. It is dry the rest of the year. When continuously irrigated, these soils are moist below the surface throughout the year.
Soil Temperature: 17 to 20 degrees C (Soil temperature usually does not go below 8 degrees C
Thickness of HTM: greater than 200 centimeters or to bedrock, whichever is shallower.
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent angular channers detached from local bedrock.
Depth to bedrock: typically greater than 150 centimeters.
Depth to redoximorphic features: typically within 75 centimeters in irrigated areas. Non-irrigated land do not have redox features.
Calcium carbonate equivalence: 0 to 10 percent.
Reaction: neutral to moderately alkaline.
Colors: multiple matrix colors are typical.
Artifacts: 0 to 10 percent construction debris

^A(u) horizon:
Dry Color: hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 5, chroma of 2 to 4 
Moist Color: hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, chroma of 2 to 4
Texture: loam, clay loam, clay. 
Clay content: 20 to 44 percent

^C(u) horizons:
Dry Color: hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 5, chroma of  3 to 6
Moist Color: hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, chroma of 2 to 6
Texture: Clay loam, clay, silty clay, sandy clay loam, loam.
Clay: 30 to 55 percent

COMPETING SERIES: These are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landscape: hills
Landform: man-made, cut and fill terraces of developed hillsides.
Slopes: 0 to 5 percent on the treads and up to 65 percent on the risers.
Parent material: human-transported materials originating from material weathered from shale, sandstone, siltstone, or other related sources.
Elevation: 75 to 400 meters.
Mean annual precipitation: 280 to 580 mm.
Mean annual temperature: 16 to 19 degrees C.
Frost free season: 300 to 365 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Altamont series: have cracks at the surface in the summer.
Apollo series: have a paralithic contact at a depth of 100 to 150 cm.
Balcom series: have a calcic horizon.
Fontana series: have a paralithic contact at a depth of 50 to 100 cm.
Nacimiento series: have calcium carbonate throughout and a paralithic contact at a depth of 50 to 100 cm.
San Benito series: have a mollic epipedon that is greater than 50 cm thick and a paralithic contact at a depth of 100 to 150 cm.
Soper series: have an argillic horizon and a paralithic contact at a depth of 50 to 100 cm.
Zaca series: have a paralithic contact at a depth of 100 to 150 cm.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained or somewhat poorly drained (where heavily irrigated and compacted).  Runoff is high. Permeability is moderately slow to slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: Counterfeit soils are for recreation, commercial and residential development in urban area. Vegetation is ornamental plants, lawns, trees, shrubs, and annual grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Hills and low mountains of Southern California Mountains; MLRA 20. These soils are moderately extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California

SERIES PROPOSED: City of Walnut, Los Angeles County, California, 2010.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon j- the zone form a depth of 0 to 13 cm
Human-transported materials - the zone form a depth of 0 to 200 cm
Artifacts - the zone from a depth of 13 to 95 cm
Particle Size Control Section for this pedon - the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 cm

Some pedons meet the requirements for the mollic epipedon and/or the anthropic epipedon.  Both are included in this concept.

Since the OSD Tool is malfunctioning, the classification cannot be updated to the 12th edition.  the Taxonomic class should be Fine, spolic, smectitic, calcareous, thermic Typic Xerorthents.
