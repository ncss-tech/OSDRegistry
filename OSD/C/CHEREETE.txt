CHEREETE SERIES

The Chereete series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in outwash, alluvium, or colluvium. These soils are on outwash fans, drainageways, and escarpments. Slopes are 1 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 368 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Typic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Chereete gravelly coarse sandy loam, in rangeland on a 25 percent slope at 1,030 meters elevation (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 13 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine and medium irregular pores; 15 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.3); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 15 cm thick)

    Bw--13 to 36 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 15 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 32 cm thick)

    C1--36 to 64 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly loamy coarse sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual smooth boundary. (22 to 136 cm thick)

    C2--64 to 152 cm; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) very gravelly coarse sand, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; 45 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2).
