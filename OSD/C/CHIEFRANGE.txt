CHIEFRANGE SERIES

The Chiefrange series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from quartzite. Chiefrange soils are on mountains. Slope ranges from 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 225 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Chiefrange extremely cobbly loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered with 20 percent gravel, 40 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones.

    A--0 to 10 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely cobbly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine, and few medium roots; many very fine and fine vesicular pores; 30 percent gravel and 40 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 13 cm thick)

    Bt--10 to 34 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/4) very cobbly clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine and few medium tubular pores; few faint clay films on surfaces along pores and between sand grains; very few distinct sand coats on bottom surfaces of rock fragments and faces of peds; 20 percent gravel and 25 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.3); clear smooth boundary. (20 to 35 cm thick)

    2Btk--34 to 57 cm; strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) very gravelly clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and common fine roots; common very fine and fine and few medium tubular pores; few faint clay films on surfaces along pores and between sand grains; few fine secondary calcium carbonate masses on bottom surfaces of rock fragments, 1 to 2 percent (by volume); 35 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5). (20 to 55 cm thick)

    2R--57 cm; indurated quartzite.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bairs, Basket, Breko, Cowgil, Drino, Hefed, Huilepass, Hunewill, Jungo, Kayo, Lithgow, Plush, Schader, Stucky, and Washoe series.

Bairs, Basket, Breko, Cowgil, Hefed, Huilepass, Hunewill, Jungo, Kayo, Plush, Stucky, and Washoe soils are very deep. Drino soils average 15 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Lithgow soils do not have secondary calcium carbonate in the profile. Schader soils have a mean annual soil temperature range of 13 to 15 degrees C and 60 to 75 percent gravel in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chiefrange soils are on mountains. They typically are on backslope positions. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from quartzite. Slope ranges from 15 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 1,500 to 2,000 meters. The climate is cool, semiarid with a mean annual temperature of 7 to 11 degrees C. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm. The frost-free period is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Checkett soils. Checkett soils are shallow to a lithic contact.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very high surface runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity;.

USE AND VEGETATION: Chiefrange soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Potential native vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, galleta, blue grama, snakeweed, bottlebrush squirreltail, and Utah juniper. This pedon has been correlated to ecological site number R029XY167NV, Gravelly Loam 8-10 P.Z.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 29.
