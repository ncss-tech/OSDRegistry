CUEVITAS SERIES

The Cuevitas series consists of soils that are very shallow and shallow to a petrocalcic horizon. These well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in non-calcareous loamy alluvium over calcareous loamy residuum. These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on broad, low ridges on inland, dissected coastal plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 22.2 degrees C (72 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 559 mm (22 in). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, active, hyperthermic, shallow Aridic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Cuevitas fine sandy loam, on a southwest facing 1 percent slope in rangeland; elevation is 243.8 m (800 ft).  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A1--0 to 3 cm (0 to 1 in); brown (7.5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.

    A2--3 to 23 cm (1 to 9 in); reddish brown (5YR 4/3) fine sandy loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many fine pores; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizon is 10 to 46 cm [4 to 18 in])

    Bkkm1--23 to 41 cm (9 to 16 in); very pale brown (10YR 8/2) strongly cemented calcium carbonate; laminar cap is 10 cm (4 in) thick; moderately alkaline. (157 to 193 cm [62 to 76 in] thick)

    Bkkm2--41 to 203 cm (16 to 80 in); very pale brown (10YR 8/2) weakly cemented calcium carbonate; apparent field texture is fine sandy loam, or loam; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no series in the same family. Similar soils are the Delmita, Jimenez, Lacoste, Quemado, Piedras, Randado, and Zapata series.
Delmita, Lacoste, and Randado soils: have an argillic horizon
Jimenez, Piedras, and Quemado soils: are loamy-skeletal in the particle-size control section
Zapata soils: are calcareous throughout the solum and are drier in the soil moisture control section for longer periods. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: noncalcareous loamy alluvium over calcareous loamy residuum and petrocalcics of the Goliad Formation
Landscape: inland, dissected coastal plains
Landform: broad, low ridges 
Slope: 0 to 3 percent
Precipitation pattern: The soil is driest during the months of June through August and December through February. These soils are intermittently moist in September through November and March through May.
Mean annual precipitation: 508 to 610 mm (20 to 24 in)
Thornthwaite annual P-E indices: 21 to 34
Mean annual temperature: 21.1 to 23.3 degrees C (70 to 74 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 280 to 360 days
Elevation: 9.1 to 289.6 m (30 to 950 ft) 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brennan, Copita, Delmita, Randado, and Zapata series. 
Brennan soils: have very deep solum, an argillic horizon, and occur on higher positions. 
Copita soils: are moderately deep to a paralithic contact of sandstone, drier in the SMCS for longer periods, and occur on higher positions. 
Delmita and Randado soils:  occur on similar to slightly lower positions. 
Zapata soils: occur on similar to slightly higher positions

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderately rapid above the petrocalcic and slow to very slow in the petrocalcic. Runoff is high on slopes less than 1 percent and very high on 1 to 3 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The principal native grasses are plains bristlegrass, hooded windmillgrass, tanglehead, trichloris, Arizona cottontop, red grama, hairy tridens, perennial threeawn, and whorled dropseed. Common brush species are blackbrush, guajillo, kidneywood, ratany, and leatherstem. The ecological site is Shallow Sandy Loam, 20-25 PZ (R083CY487TX).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Rio Grande Plain, Texas; LRR I; MLRA 83C; the series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Jim Hogg County, Texas, 1970, Jim Hogg Soil Survey Area, Texas. 

REMARKS: Classification change from Ustic Petrocalcids to Aridic Ustochrepts in 1998 was based on geographic distribution of the soil, analysis of rainfall patterns, and range species composition and production. Classification change from Aridic Ustochrepts to Aridic Haplustepts based on application of the second edition of Soil Taxonomy, 1999. The soil would classify as Petrocalcidic Haplustepts were this subgroup provided in Soil Taxonomy. 

Edited 11/2016 (RFG-GWH): Updated competing series, geographic setting, and associated soils sections.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Particle size control section: 0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 in). (A horizons) 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 in). (A horizons) 
Petrocalcic horizon: 23 to 203 cm (9 to 80 in). (Bkkm horizons) 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Particle-size analysis was performed at the local project office for 3 pedons from Duval County. The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is estimated based on laboratory data from similar soils in the geographic area.
