COATSBURG SERIES 

The Coatsburg series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils on till plains. The modern soil is largely super-imposed in a paleosol thought to be of Illinoisan age.  Slope ranges from 4 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 10.6 degrees C (51 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Butler, Carbika, Chancellor, Clarinda, Edinburg, Fosterburg, Haig, Lodgepole, Mazaska, Minnetonka, Sacville, Sampsel, Taintor, Terrabella, Virden, Winterset, and Worthing series. Butler and Clarinda soils average more than 45 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Carbika and Sacville soils have a mean annual soil temperature of more than 13 degrees C (56 degrees F). Chancellor, Lodgepole and Worthing soils have mollic epipedons that extend to depths greater than 51 cm (20 inches). Edinburg, Fosterburg, Haig, Minnetonka, Taintor, Virden, and  Winterset soils average less than 15 percent sand in the particle-size control section. In addition, Fosterburg soils contain a concentration of between 5 and 15 percent exchangeable sodium. Mazaska soils have free carbonates above a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Sampsel soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 203 cm (80 inches). Terrabella soils have matrix colors with hues redder than 10YR in the middle part of the series control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Coatsburg soils are on the upper ends of incised drainageways and convex side slopes on till plains. They formed in 51 cm (20 inches) or less of loess or other silty material, and glacial till or accretion gley that contains a strongly developed paleosol. Slopes commonly are 5 to 10 percent, but range from 4 to 20 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 12.2 degrees C (46 to 54 degrees F); mean annual soil temperature ranges from 11.1  to 13.3 degrees C (52 to 56 degrees F); mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 1016 mm (29 to 40 inches); frost free days range from 150 to 190 days; and elevation ranges from 122 to 305 meters (400 to 1000 feet) above sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Assumption, Atlas, Keller, and Ogle soils. The well drained or moderately well drained Assumption soils are upslope or at higher elevations than Coatsburg soils. The somewhat poorly drained Atlas and Keller soils, and the well drained Ogle soils are on similar slopes nearby. Atlas soils are the forested member of a biosequence with Coatsburg soils. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Coatsburg soils are poorly drained.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low to moderately low (0.01 to 0.42 micrometers per second). Permeability is very slow. Surface runoff potential is medium to very high. At undisturbed sites there is a perched water table at depths of 0 to 31 cm (0 to 1.0 foot) during the spring in most years. These soils are seasonally wet and seepy. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used for pasture or for forages that are cut for hay. Cultivated crops are on some of the less sloping areas. Native vegetation is prairie grasses. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western and northwestern Illinois; LRRs K and M, MLRAs 95B, 108B, and 115C.  The series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Stephenson County, Illinois, 1969. 

REMARKS: The variability of the properties in the Coatsburg series is related to the geologic truncation of the paleosol before it was buried by loess, and to the extent that modern soil forming processes have altered the paleosol. Many of the properties of the 2Btg horizon are believed to have been inherited from the paleosol. It is difficult to differentiate the properties of the lower part of the modern soil from those of the paleosol in many pedons. Some mapped areas of this soil contain buried horizons (subscript b) of the paleosol beneath the modern solum. Calcium and other bases have been replenished in some pedons after burial by loess by seepage water from upslope or from the mantling material. This causes the reaction of the solum to have a wide range. The type location was moved to this more representative pedon in 1996. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
mollic epipedon - from a depth of 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 inches) (Ap and AB horizons)
argillic horizon - from a depth 25 to 178 cm (10 to 70 inches) (2Btg horizons)
lithologic discontinuity at a depth of 25 cm (10 inches)
