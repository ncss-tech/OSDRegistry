CHAPPELL SERIES

The Chappell series consists of soils that are moderately deep over coarse sand or gravelly sand.  They are well drained soils on river valley terraces and upland hillslopes.  Soils formed in loamy colluvium and alluvium deposited over coarse sand or gravelly sand.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 38 centimeters (15 inches).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Chappell fine sandy loam in native grass.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  A2--18 43 centimeters (7 to 17 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (7 to 20 inches thick)

  Bw--43 to 64 centimeters (17 to 25 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine and medium prismatic subangular bocky structure; slightly hard, friable; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (13 to 51 centimeters (5 to 20 inches) thick)

  C1--64 to 89 centimeters (25 to 35 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive and slightly hard, friable; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; gradual, smooth boundary.  (0 to 38 centimeters (0 to 15 inches) thick)

  2C2--89 to 152 centimeters (35 to 60 inches); very pale brown (10YR 7/4) gravelly coarse sand, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; single grain; loose; slightly alkaline; slight effervescence.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Alice, Blanche, Busher, Creighton, Jayem, Lexsworth, Phiferson and Stapleton soils.
Alice soils have finer sand throughout the solum, and lack the gravel and are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.
Blanche soils are Moderately deep over bedrock.
Busher soils are deep, and formed in material weathered from soft fine grain sandstone.
Creighton soils have finer sand throughout the solum, and lack the gravel.
Jayem soils have finer sand throughout the solum, and lack the gravel.
Lexsworth soils are moderately well drained and on flood plains.
Phiferson soils are moderately deep to sandstone.
Stapleton soils formed in sediments derived from arkose deposits and contain angular grantic sand and gravel.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: gravelly and sandy colluvium and alluvium weathered from Tertiary formations and gravelly pleistocene terraces
