COVEY SERIES

The Covey series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and slope alluvium derived from sedimentary rock and calcareous conglomerate. These soils are on alluvial fans and fan remnants. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 4.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Haploxeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Covey loam in rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

 A--0 to 5 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; common fine and very fine roots throughout; common fine dendritic tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 8 cm thick)

 Bt--5 to 21 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; common fine and very fine roots throughout; common fine dendritic tubular pores; 5 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; very slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (15 to 22 cm thick)

 Btk--21 to 57 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; common very fine, fine and few medium roots throughout; common fine dendritic tubular pores; 20 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 10 percent fine carbonate masses in matrix; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (32 to 38 cm thick)

 Bk--57 to 97 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few very fine roots throughout; few fine dendritic tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; 30 percent carbonate concretions on bottom surfaces of rock fragments and 10 percent fine carbonate masses in matrix; violenlty effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual smooth boundary.  (36 to 42 cm thick)

 C--97 to 200 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; common fine interstitial pores; finely disseminated carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).
