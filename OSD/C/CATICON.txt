CATICON SERIES

The Caticon series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in pluvial lake sediments and alluvium.  These soils are on lake plains on basin floors.  Slope ranges from 1 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, smectitic, thermic Vertic Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON: Caticon silty clay - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated).

        A--0 to 2 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/3) crushed, silty clay, brown 7.5YR 4/4) crushed, moist; 37 percent clay; strong very fine granular structure; moderately sticky, very plastic; many very fine roots throughout; violently effervescence, by HCl, 3 normal; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick)

        Bw1--2 to 8 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/3) crushed, silty clay, brown (7.5YR 4/4) crushed, moist; 37 percent clay; strong coarse prismatic parts to strong coarse subangular blocky structure; very sticky, very plastic; common very fine roots throughout; violently effervescence, by HCl, 3 normal; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.

        Bw2--8 to 22 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) crushed, clay, brown (7.5YR 4/4) crushed, moist; 40 percent clay; moderate coarse prismatic structure; very sticky, very plastic; few very fine roots throughout; violently effervescence, by HCl, 3 normal; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of Bw horizons is 15 to 24 inches.)

        Bk1--22 to 35 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) crushed, clay, brown (7.5YR 4/4) crushed, moist; 40 percent clay; moderate coarse prismatic structure; very sticky, very plastic; few very fine roots throughout; 10 percent fine irregular carbonate masses throughout; violently effervescence, by HCl, 3 normal; slightly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.

        Bk2--35 to 80 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/3) crushed, clay, brown (7.5YR 5/4) crushed, moist; 40 percent clay; moderate coarse prismatic structure; very sticky, very plastic; 15 percent fine irregular carbonate masses throughout; violently effervescence, by HCl, 3 normal; slightly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Dona Ana County, New Mexico; approximately 10.6 miles south and 5.6 miles east of White Sands; 120 feet west and 2,000 feet south of the northeast corner of sec. 12, T. 24 S., R. 5 E.  USGS Newman NW topographic quadrangle; latitude 32 degrees 14 minutes 12.97 seconds north and longitude 106 degrees 22 minutes 39.43 seconds west.  UTM zone 13, 370202E, 3567345N; NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Mean annual soil temperature: 63 to 67 degrees F.


Particle-size control section (weighted average):

Clay content: 40 to 60 percent

A horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4, dry or moist

Bw horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Ciervo (CA) series. The Ciervo soils are moderately well drained and have gypsum crystals in most pedons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: pluvial lake sediments and alluvium
Landform: lake plains on basin floors
Slope: 1 to 3 percent
Mean annual temperature: 62 to 66 degrees
Mean annual precipitation: 8 to 10 inches
Precipitation pattern: precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September. The driest months are March and April. Precipitation during the months of January, February, and March is less than 13 percent of the total.
Frost-free period: 200 to 240 days
Elevation: 3,900 to 4,200 feet

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Copia, Elizario, Globe, Mcnew, and Pendero soils.
The Copia soils are sandy and are on dunes.
The Elizario soils are fine-loamy and are on slightly depressed alluvial flats on basin floors.
The Globe soils have slickensides and are on depressional lake plains on basin floors.
The Mcnew soils are fine-loamy and are on alluvial flats on basin floors.
The Pendero soils are sandy and on sand sheets on basin floors.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderately slow. Runoff is medium.

USE AND VEGETATION: Vegetation is of the Desert Shrub type consisting of tobosa, burrograss, mesquite, and tarbush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern New Mexico; LRR D, MLRA 42. The series is of small extent.
