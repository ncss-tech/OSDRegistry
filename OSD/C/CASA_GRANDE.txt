CASA GRANDE SERIES

The Casa Grande series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in old mixed alluvium. Casa Grande soils are on fan terraces and relict basin floors and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches (175 mm) and the mean annual air temperature is about 72 degrees F. (22.2 degrees C.)

In some pedons an E horizon occurs below the A horizon and above the Bt horizon. Where present it is from 1 to 3 inches thick.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Casa Grande soils are on nearly level fan terraces and relict basin floors at elevations of 700 to 2,000 feet (213 to 609 m). Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. These soils formed in old alluvium from a wide variety of rocks including granite, rhyolite, andesite, quartzite and possibly some limestone and basalt. Annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches (150 to 250 mm); and the mean annual air temperature is 67 to 75 degrees F. (19.4 to 23.9 degrees C.) The frost-free period ranges from 240 to 350 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kamato, Redun, Shontik and Tatai soils. Kamato soils average more than 35 percent clay in the control section. Redun, Shontik and Tatai soils do not have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow runoff; slow or very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat and irrigated cropland. Vegetation is desert saltbush, linear-leaf saltbush, wolfberry and scattered mesquite.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Arizona; mainly in the central valley areas. This series is extensive. Total extent is about 260,000 acres.  MLRA is 40.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 1 inch (0 to 2.5 cm) (A horizon)

Natric horizon - the zone from 5 to 39 inches (12.5 to 97.5 cm) (Btknz horizon)

Calcic horizon - the zone from 18 to 39 inches (45 to 97.5 cm) (Btknz4 and Btknz5 horizons)

Classified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006

Revised for the correlation of AZ661, 11/08, PDC

The type location was moved in November 1999 to correspond to the site sampled for the state soil.

The type location was moved sometime between 1957 and 1972 from Pinal County to Maricopa County.
