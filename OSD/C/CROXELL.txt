CROXELL SERIES

The Croxell series consist of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on stream terraces and flood-plain steps. Slopes are from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 191 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquic Natrargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Croxell sandy loam, 3 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 1,464 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

   A--0 to 8 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots throughout; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 15 cm thick)

   Btn1--8 to 22 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; moderately hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine roots throughout, common very fine dendritic tubular pores; 26 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); gradual smooth boundary. 

   Btn2--22 to 50 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots throughout, common very fine dendritic tubular pores; 20 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 5 percent 5YR 5/6 oxidized iron masses; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of Btn horizons is 23 to 65 cm)

   C--50 to 120 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots throughout, few very fine dendritic tubular pores; 10 percent 5YR 5/4 oxidized iron masses, 15 percent 2.5Y 6/2 iron depletions; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (40 to 100 cm thick)

   Cg--120 to 200 cm; greenish gray (10Y 5/1) very gravelly sandy loam, very dark greenish gray (10Y 3/1) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 2 percent 10YR 3/1 manganese masses, 5 percent 5YR 5/4 oxidized iron masses, 25 percent 2.5Y 6/1 iron depletions; 40 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8)
