SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Kleberg County, Texas; 2007.  The name is from a town in Nueces County near the type location. The series type location was moved to San Patricio County as a result of the Soil Data Join and Recorrelation initiative.

REMARKS:  The series was formerly included in the Orelia and Racombes series.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle size control section: 20 to 70 cm. (8 to 28 in) (Bt1, Bt2 and, Bt3 horizons)
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 66 cm. (0 to 26 in) (A, Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Argillic horizon: 20 to 203 cm. (8 to 80 in) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Btk1, Btk2, and Btk3 horizons)
Redoximorphic concentrations: 36 to 140 cm. (14 to 55 in) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and Btk1 horizons)
The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by local laboratory data from the type location from Nueces County, Texas.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Texas A&M University Soil Characterization Laboratory data from a representative location on sample S05TX-355-004.
