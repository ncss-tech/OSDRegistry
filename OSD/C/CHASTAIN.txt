MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina. 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Grady County, Georgia; 1908. 

REMARKS: The July 2009 revision corrects the error on flooding duration.  Flooding for this soil has always been very brief to very long.  
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to 5 inches (A horizon)
Aquic conditions--the zone from 5 inches to a depth of 80 inches is periodically saturated (endosaturation)
