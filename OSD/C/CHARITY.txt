CHARITY SERIES

The Charity series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils formed in clayey lacustrine deposits on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid Typic Epiaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Charity fine sandy loam. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

 Ap--0 to 20 cm (8 inches); very dark gray (10YR 3/1) fine sandy loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; moderate medium granular structure; friable; common fine and medium roots; common fine faint dark gray (10YR 4/1) iron depletions; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. [18 to 30 cm (7 to 12 inches) thick]

 Bg--20 to 23 cm (8 to 9 inches); grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) gravelly sandy loam; moderate medium granular structure; friable; common medium roots; few fine prominent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) masses of oxidized iron; about 15 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt broken boundary. [0 to 5 cm (2 inches) thick]

 2Bw--23 to 66 cm (9 to 26 inches); reddish brown (5YR 5/3) silty clay loam; common strong medium angular blocky structure; firm; common fine roots; medium prominent greenish gray (5GY 6/1) iron depletions on ped faces; few medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron in the interior of peds; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline, diffuse wavy boundary. [25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 inches) thick]

 2C--66 to 203 cm (26 to 80 inches); reddish brown (5YR 5/4) silty clay; massive; firm; common fine prominent greenish gray (5G 6/1) iron depletions along root channels; few medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron in ped interiors; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Charity soils are on nearly level to depressional areas on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in clayey lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 762 mm (28 to 30 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 5.5 to 7.2 degrees C (42 to 45 degrees F). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Allendale and Pinconning soils. The somewhat poorly drained Allendale and the poorly drained or very poorly drained Pinconning soils are on beaches and sand bars bordering areas of Charity soils. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained or very poorly drained. The depth to the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (one foot) above the surface to 30 cm (one foot) below the surface between September and June in normal years. Potential surface runoff is negligible to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is very slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of this soil have been drained but are now idle or abandoned. Vegetation is red osier dogwood and grasses. Native vegetation is northern white cedar and tamarack or cattail marsh. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 94A and 94C in northern lower peninsula of Michigan bordering Great Lakes. The series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Cheboygan County, Michigan, 1988. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 20 cm (8 inches) (Ap horizon).
Cambic horizon: from a depth of 20 to 66 cm (8 to 26 inches) (Bg and 2Bw horizons).
Aquic conditions: redoximorphic features present throughout the profile.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Classification of this soil to fine-silty is based on CaCO3 clay in the control section. See National Soil Survey Laboratory pedon S 86MI-031-006.
