CEDARPAN SERIES

The Cedarpan series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Permeability is very slow.  These soils are on upland drainage divides and have slopes ranging from 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, smectitic, frigid, shallow Natric Durustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Cedarpan loam - on a 1 percent northeast facing plane slope in rangeland (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated)

(3 to 8 inches thick)

(Combined 3Btn horizons 15 to 50 inches thick)

	3BC--45 to 54 inches; gray (2.5Y 6/1) silty clay, gray (2.5Y 5/1) moist; massive; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common medium irregular masses of silica pedogenic throughout; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 15 inches thick)

	3Cy--54 to 80 inches; gray (2.5Y 6/1) silty clay, gray (2.5Y 5/1) moist; massive; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common fine rounded nests of gypsum pedogenic throughout; common medium irregular masses of silica pedogenic throughout; moderately alkaline.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arnegard, Amor, Cabba, Daglum, Dogtooth, Farfeld, Farnuf, Janesburg, Lefor, Parshall, Reeder, Regent, Wyola, Tally, Vebar and Wayden soils.  Arnegard and Parshall soils are in swales.  They do not have a natric horizon and are very deep.  Amor, Tally and Vebar soils are on side slopes.  They do not have a natric horizon.  Cabba and Wayden soils are on knobs and ridges.  They have soft bedrock at depths of 10 to 20 inches and do not have a natric horizon.  Daglum, Dogtooth, Janesburg and Farfeld soils are intermixed with the Cedarpan soil.  Daglum, Janesburg and Dogtooth soils have soft bedrock below a depth of 20 inches.  Farfeld soils do not have a natric horizon.  Farnuf, Lefor, Reeder, Regent and Wyola soils are on fans.  They do not have a natric horizon and do not have a duripan within 20 inches of the surface.    

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained. Permeability is very slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: Cedarpan soils are used for rangeland.  The potential native vegetation is mainly western wheatgrass and blue grama. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwestern North Dakota.  Cedarpan soils are of moderate extent.
