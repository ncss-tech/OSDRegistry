CLEET SERIES

The Cleet series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Cleet soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Xeric Argidurids 

TYPICAL PEDON: Cleet very gravelly sandy loam--on a 2 percent slope at 1,475 meters elevation--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

   A--0 to 5 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and common fine roots; common fine and common medium tubular pores; 35 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, and 2 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 18 cm thick)

  Bt1--5 to 13 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, many fine, and few medium roots; common fine and common medium tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 30 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 15 cm thick) 

   Bt2--13 to 37 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine angular blocky; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, common fine, and few medium roots; few fine and few medium tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 30 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 25 cm thick) 

  Bkqm1--37 to 107 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) cemented material, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; rigid; very strongly cemented by silica and secondary carbonates; few very fine and few fine roots in cracks; few fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; gradual smooth boundary. 

  Bkqm2--107 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) cemented material, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; rigid; strongly cemented by silica and secondary carbonates; violently effervescent. (Combined thickness of the Bkqm horizons is 60 to 127 cm) 

TYPE LOCATION: Lake County, Oregon; between the Coyote Hills and the Rabbit Hills; approximately 600 feet east and 800 feet south of the northwest corner of section 30, T. 34 S., R. 24 E.; USGS Rabbit Hills SW 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 42 degrees 35 minutes 52 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 56 minutes 22 seconds W; NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: Usually moist in winter and early spring, dry from late spring through late fall; aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric. 
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C. 
Ochric epipedon thickness: 5 to 18 cm. 
Depth to base of argillic horizon: 36 to 50 cm.

Depth to bedrock: More than 150 cm. 

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 18 to 25 percent.

Other feature: Some pedons have C horizons below the duripan. 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Brock, Deepeek, Hotcreek, Indicove, Lapon, Malmesa, Oleman, Shinnpeak, Troughs, Vinini, and Wanapum series. 

Brock soils are effervescent throughout. Deepeek and Shinnpeak soils have 25 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Hotcreek and Malmesa soils have lithic contacts at depths of less than 50 cm from the soil surface.  Indicove soils are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days between July and September due to convection storms; particle-size control section with 50 to 75 percent rock fragments, mainly gravel of quartzite lithology. Lapon soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have lithic contacts at depths of 38 to 100 cm from the soil surface. Oleman soils have 25 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have mean annual soil temperature of 13 to 14 degrees C. Troughs soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have lithic contacts at depths of 50 to 100 cm from the soil surface. Vinini soils have lithic contacts at depths of 50 to 100 cm from the soil surface. Wanapum soils have mean annual soil temperature of 11 to 13 degrees C. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cleet soils are on fan remnants. These soils formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,350 to 1,525 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Enko, Lonegrave, and Locane soils. Enko soils are coarse-loamy, very deep, have cambic horizons, and are on lake terraces. Lonegrave soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts, have cambic horizons, and are on plateaus. Locane soils are clayey-skeletal, shallow to lithic contacts, and are on hills. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very high surface runoff; moderate permeability: moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Cleet soils are used for livestock grazing. The vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, Thurber's needlegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Indian ricegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Oregon. These soils are not extensive with about 9,300 acres of the series mapped to date. MLRA 23.
