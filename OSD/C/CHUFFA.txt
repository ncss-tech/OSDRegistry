CHUFFA SERIES

The Chuffa series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone and welded tuff over mixed lacustrine deposits. The Chuffa soils are on fan skirts, basin floors, and lake plains. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Haplocambids 

TYPICAL PEDON: Chuffa silt loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Fifteenmile McLoughlin, Ottmar, Schlomer and Tulch series. 

Fifteenmile soils have Bqk horizons. McLoughlin soils are moist for 45 consecutive days following summer solstice and are moderately or strongly saline-alkali. Ottmar soils have a deep paralithic contact and Bk horizons at 56 to 90 cm. Schlomer soils have a paralithic contact at moderate depth and Bk horizons at 38 to 66 cm. Tulch soils are noncalcareous in the cambic horizon and have Bk horizon between 66 to 100 cm. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chuffa soils are on fan skirts, basin floors, and lake plains. These soils formed in mixed alluvium over lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations are  1,500 to 1,850 feet. The climate is semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm;,mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Teebone and the Yobe series. Teebone soils have calcic horizons and have fine textures. Yobe soils have SAR values greater than 13 and an aquic moisture regime. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained, medium runoff, moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Chuffa soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The potential native vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, black greasewood, and graymolly kochia. This pedon is correlated to Ecological Site R028AY008NV, Sodic Terrace 8-10 P.Z.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28A.
