CLOVIS SERIES 

The Clovis series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in medium and moderately fine textured sediments from quartzite gneiss, schist, sandstone, and limestone.  The Clovis soils are on fan terraces, piedmont slopes, and plains.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil Moisture:  The peak moist period occurs in July, August, September, and October with 50 to 60 percent of the yearly moisture occurring.  Five to 7 inches of precipitation occurs in July and August and the soil moisture control section is moist in some or all parts for 10 to 15 consecutive days in the 120 days after the summer solstice. 

Soil Temperature:  52 to 59 degrees F. 

Depth to the base of the Bt or Btk:  20 to 32 inches. 

Depth to calcium carbonate:  12 to 18 inches. 

Depth to the calcic horizon:  18 to 36 inches. 

Rock fragments:  less than 15 percent stones, cobbles, or pebbles. 

A horizon:  

Hue - 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR 
Value:  4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist 
Chroma:  2 to 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist 
Other feature:  when mollic colors occur the epipedon is too thin to qualify for a mollic epipedon.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alvey, Barx, Cabreros, Cerrillos, Fernando, Flaco, Horchata, Maysdorf, Millett, Palabria, Progresso, Sanostee, Scholle, Selpats, Solirec, Spenlo, Threetop, Tuweep, and Wineg series.  

Alvey soils have hue of 10YR or are yellower in the particle-size control section.
Cabreros, Flaco, Horchata, Progresso, Sanostee, and Threetop soils are moderately deep over bedrock. 
Cerrillos soils receive less than half of the annual precipitation between the months of July and October and receive less precipitation in May and June.
Maysdorf, Selpats, and Threetop soils receive maximum precipitation in May and June. In addition, Maysdorf soils contains 5 to 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the calcic horizon. 
Millett soils contains 25 to 75 percent gravel and cobbles in the lower part of the solum. 
Palabria soils are deep to bedrock and have 0 to 2 percent rock fragments in the control section.
Scholle soils contains 15 to 35 percent gravel in the control section. 
Selpats soils have skeletal lithologic discontinuity at depths ranging from 15 to 39 inches. 
Spenlo soils receive more than half of the annual precipitation between the months of July and October and receive more precipitation in May and June.
Tuweep soils are formed in alluvium from pyroclastics and basalt and have 10YR or yellower colors. 
Wineg soils have a MAST of 56 degrees F. and MAP of over 14 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Clovis soils are on fan terraces, piedmont slopes, and plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  The soils formed in medium and moderately fine textured mixed sediments from quartzite, gneiss, schist, sandstone, and limestone.  Elevations range from 4,500 to 7,200 feet.  The climate is semiarid continental. Typically, the mean annual temperature is about 49 to 57 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is typically 10 to 14 inches, but has ranged to 16 inches in some areas.  Frost-free period is 140 to 185 days.  In Arizona, the mean annual temperature drops to 48 degrees and the frost-free period is 120 to 165 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Alicia, Dean, Harvey, LaFonda, Moriarty, Pastura and Witt soils.  Alicia, Dean, Harvey, LaFonda, and Moriarty soils lack argillic horizons.  Pastura soils have petrocalcic horizons at depths less than 20 inches.  Witt soils are deeper than 36 inches to the calcic horizon and contain less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser in the control section. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is moderate or moderately slow.  Runoff is negligible on slopes less than 1 percent, very low on 1 to 3 percent slopes, low on 3 to 5 percent slopes and medium on 5 to 20 percent slopes. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Principal use is for livestock grazing, but also used for irrigated cropland and nonirrigated wheat.  The principal native vegetation is blue grama, hairy grama, galleta, sideoats grama, buffalo grass, and yucca.  Irrigated crops are alfalfa, potatoes, and sugar beets. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central New Mexico, east-central Arizona and southwest Utah.  The series is of large extent.
