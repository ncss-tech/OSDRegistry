CANPICKET SERIES

The Canpicket series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium from rhyolitic tuff.  Canpicket soils are on mountain summits, shoulders and side slopes.  Slopes range from 8 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, nonacid, thermic Lithic Ustorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Canpicket extremely cobbly sandy loam - wildlife habitat and recreation.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 4 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) extremely cobbly sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky and moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine, fine and few medium irregular pores; 25 percent gravel, 35 percent cobble, 5 percent stones; noneffervescent; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary.  (1 to 5 inches thick)

    C--4 to 9 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) very cobbly sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; weak and moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and  fine and few medium roots; common very fine and few fine and medium irregular pores; 20 percent gravel, 25 percent cobble, 5 percent stone; noneffervescent; moderately acid (pH 5.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 19 inches thick)

    2R--9 inches; hard rhyolitic tuff bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Chiricahua National Monument; located at a latitude of 32 degrees, 23 seconds North and a longitude of 109 degrees, 22 minutes, 41 seconds West.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture:  Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July - September and December - February.  Driest during May and June.  Aridic ustic soil moisture regime.

Soil Temperature:  52 to 58 degrees F.

Rock Fragments:  15 to 50 percent gravel, 10 to 40 percent cobble, 0 to 5 percent stones

A horizon
Hue:  7.5YR, 10YR
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma:  2 or 3, dry or moist

C horizon
Hue:  7.5YR, 10YR
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma:  2, 3 or 4, dry or moist

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Morimount (AZ) series.  Morimount soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section and formed from sandstone and siltstone.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Canpicket soils are on mountain summits, shoulders and side slopes.  Slopes range from 8 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from rhyolitic tuff.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 23 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December and January.  The mean annual air temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 160 to 200 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Massai soils.  Massai soils are deep and very deep to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; high runoff; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for wildlife habitat and recreation.  Vegetation includes pinyon pine, alligator juniper, Toumey oak, manzanita, mahogany, yucca, agave, sotol, nolina, beggartick, Texas bluestem, turpentine bush, bullgrass, hairy grama and sideoats grama.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Arizona.  Canpicket soils are of limited extent. This soil occurs in LRR-D, MLRA 41.
