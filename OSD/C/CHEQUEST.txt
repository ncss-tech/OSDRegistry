SERIES ESTABLISHED: Van Buren County, Iowa, 1960

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 30 to 80 centimeters (12 to 31 inches) (Btg1, Btg2, and Btg3 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 152 centimeters (0 to 60 inches) (Ap, A, Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, Btg4, and Btg5 horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 30 centimeters (0 to 12 inches) (Ap and A horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from 30 to 152 centimeters (12 to 60 inches) (Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, Btg4, and Btg5 horizons);
aquic conditions--redoximorphic depletions and accumulations within in a depth of 51 centimeters (20 inches).

Vertic subgroup based on linear extensibility greater than 6.0 centimeters between the surface and a depth of 100 centimeters, and presence of cracks 5 millimeters or more wide through a thickness of 30 centimeters or more for some time in normal years.

The silt coats, clay films, and acid reaction in the Btg horizon are features similar to those of the Alfisols order. It is thought that these soils have a regular decrease in organic matter with increasing depth, but some may be marginal to Fluvaquentic Endoaquolls.

The Btg horizon has some discontinuous clay films, but the increase in clay from the A to the B horizon is not great enough nor does the clay increase occur within a short enough distance to qualify as an argillic horizon.
