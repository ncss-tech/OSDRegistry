CORDER SERIES

The Corder series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils with moderate permeability that formed in loess and weathered volcanic ash mixed with colluvium from basalt.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent on plains. The average annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the average annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Typic Argidurids

TYPICAL PEDON: Corder silt loam -- on a nearly level lava flow lobe, at 3,200 feet elevation in rangeland.  When described on May 13, 1999, the soil was dry throughout.  (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

   A1--0 to 2 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, few medium roots; many very fine irregular pores; 5 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.

   A2--2 to 4 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak thin and very fine platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, few fine and medium roots; many very fine, few fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear wavy boundary. (combined A horizon - 2 to 7 inches thick)

   Bt--4 to 11 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, few fine and medium roots; common very fine, fine and medium tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds and in pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick)

   Bkq--11 to 16 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; few very fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles coated with calcium carbonates and silica; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (3 to 10 inches thick)

   Bkqm--16 to 24 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) continuous indurated siliceous laminae 2 to 4 mm thick over light gray (10YR 7/2) very strongly cemented duripan, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; massive; 40 percent rock fragments; violently effervescent; clear wavy boundary. (2 to 10 inches thick)

   2R--24 inches; basalt.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cleaver, Dobel, Laped, Shoofly, Silent, Spanel and Tumtum series. The Cleaver, Dobel, Shoofly, Silent, Spanel and Tumtum soils do not have a lithic contact within 60 inches.  The Laped soils have soil temperatures of 47 to 52 F. and have particle-size control sections that contain 27 to 35 percent clay.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Corder soils are on plug domes, lava flow lobes, pressure ridges and tumuli on shield volcanoes of plains.  Elevations are 2,800 to 3,550 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent. These soils formed in loess and weathered volcanic ash mixed with colluvium from basalt.  Average annual precipitation is 6 to 8 inches.  Average annual temperature is 51 to 54 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 130 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chattin, Strike, and Tadpole soils.  Chattin, Strike and Tadpole soils are very deep to bedrock.  Landscape positions are similar.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to very rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Corder soils are used mainly for rangeland.  Natural vegetation is shadscale saltbush, bud sagebrush, Indian ricegrass and Thurber needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Ada and Elmore Counties, Idaho. MLRA 11. These soils are of limited extent.
