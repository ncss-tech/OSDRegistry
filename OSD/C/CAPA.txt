CAPA SERIES

The Capa series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in clayey sediments weathered from shale.  Capa soils are in swales and toeslopes on terraces and uplands in MLRA 63A, Northern Rolling Pierre Shale Plains.   Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (49 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 432 millimeters (17 inches).

Taxonomic Version:  Twelfth Edition, 2014.  The previous classification was Very-fine, smectitic, mesic Vertic Natrustolls.

AAO 8/2014  Updated the taxonomic classification, updated the Range in Characteristics, type location description, horizon nomenclature, parent material and landform, distribution and extent, geographic setting, and saturated hydraulic conductivity; added metric units to all measurements and temperatures, and changed format to tabular.
