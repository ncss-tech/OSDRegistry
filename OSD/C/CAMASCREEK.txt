CAMASCREEK SERIES

The Camascreek series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces and drainageways.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 44F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, frigid Aquic Natrixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Camascreek silt loam in range.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

    A1--0 to 8 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) silt loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate medium platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and common medium roots; many very fine and fine pores; strongly effervescent, disseminated lime; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 14 inches thick)

    A2--8 to 15 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to strong very fine and fine angular blocky; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and medium and few coarse roots; few very fine pores; violently effervescent, disseminated lime; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick)

    Btkn1--15 to 23 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to strong fine and medium angular and subangular blocky; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and very plastic; few fine roots; common very fine and fine pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and in pores; strongly effervescent, common fine soft masses of lime; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual smooth boundary. (7 to 12 inches thick)

    Btkn2--23 to 43 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; common faint grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) redox depletions; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, very firm, moderately sticky and very plastic; few fine roots; common fine and medium pores; few distinct clay films on faces of peds; strongly effervescent, many fine soft masses of lime; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth boundary. (8 to 22 inches thick)

    BC--43 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silty clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; common distinct grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) redox depletions; massive; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and very plastic; few fine pores; slightly effervescent, disseminated lime; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - alluvial fans, stream terraces and drainageways.
Elevation - 2,700 to 3,100 feet.
Slope - 0 to 2 percent
Parent material - alluvium.
Climate - long cold winters, moist springs, and warm, dry summers.
Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 16 inches, much of which falls as snow and spring rains.
Mean annual temperature - 41 to 45 degrees F.
Frost-free period is 90 to 120 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly as range and grass pasture with some small areas as irrigated cropland.  The native vegetation is mainly basin wildrye and nuttall alkaligrass.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Camascreek soils are inextensive in mountain valleys of western Montana. MLRA 44A
