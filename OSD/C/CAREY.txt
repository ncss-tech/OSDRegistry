CAREY SERIES

The Carey series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in weakly consolidated silty or sandy sediments of Permian age. These soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping shoulders and summits of dissected terraces on uplands of the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78B, 78C). Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual air temperature is 14 degrees C (61 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is 635 mm (25 in).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: LRR H-Central Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range Region; Northwestern part of the Central Rolling Red Plains of Texas and adjoining areas in Oklahoma (MLRA'S 78B & 78C). The series is of moderate extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Harmon County, Oklahoma; 1943. 

REMARKS: 
These soils were formerly classified in the Reddish Chestnut great soil group. 

The Carey series originally was considered as deep and very deep 100 to 178 cm (40 to 70 in) to Permian sediments. Most of the 100 to 152 cm (40 to 60 in) areas are in Oklahoma and interpretations have been developed for this soil. As these survey areas are updated, a new series will be developed to better define this soil. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon: 
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 36 cm (0 to 14 in) (A horizon) 
Argillic horizon:  36 to 122 cm (14 to 48 in) (Bt horizons)
