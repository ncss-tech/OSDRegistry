CABOOL SERIES

The Cabool series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils on uplands. They formed in loess deposited over chert and sandstone bedrock. These soils are on gently sloping upland ridgetops and sideslopes. Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual temperature is 55 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, semiactive, mesic Typic Hapludults

TYPICAL PEDON: Cabool silt loam - on a convex 3 percent slope in corn stubble. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

Ap--0 to 12 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; moderate medium granular structure; very friable; many fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (8 to 13 inches thick).

Bt1--12 to 20 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silt loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; many fine roots; many fine tubular pores; few distinct clay films on faces of peds; medium acid (pH 5.9); clear smooth boundary.

Bt2--20 to 25 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) silt loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; few distinct clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent chert gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.5); clear smooth boundary.

Bt3--25 to 31 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) silt loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine roots; many fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent chert gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.2); clear wavy boundary.

Bt4--31 to 38 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) silt loam; common fine prominent brown (10YR 5/3) mottles; moderate coarse platy structure; friable; few fine roots; common fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent chert gravel; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 12 to 28 inches).

2R--38 inches; chert bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION: Texas County, Missouri; about 4 miles northeast of Mountain Grove; 1800 feet north and 150 feet west of the southeast corner of Sec. 27, T. 29 N., R. 12 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  Coarse fragments range from 2 to 10 percent throughout the profile. The particle size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay.

The A horizon has value of 3 or 4. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.

The Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, the chroma of 4 or 6. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the upper part and is very strongly acid or strongly acid in the lower part.

The 2R horizon consists of layers of very hard chert and quartzose sandstone.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Chillium, Fletcher, Greenbriar, Jessietown, Kurtz, Talleyville, Wernock and Whitley series. Chillium, Fletcher, Greenbriar, Kurtz, Talleyville and Whitley series are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock. Jessietown soils lack mottles in the lower part of the B horizon and have a paralithic horizon above the lithic contact. Wernock soils have a paralithic contact within 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cabool soils are on gently rolling uplands. These soils formed in a thin mantle of loess underlain by very hard chert or quartzose sandstone. Slopes range from 2 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Doniphan, Poynor and Tonti series. Doniphan and Poynor soils are deep and are on dissected sideslopes. Tonti soils are deep, have a fragipan and are on broader ridgetops.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. Runoff is slow to medium. Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used mainly for hay and pasture. A few areas are used for corn and small grains. Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Ozarks region of south-central Missouri and possibly northern Arkansas. The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES PROPOSED: Texas County, Missouri, 1989. The name comes from a town in the county.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

   12 inches. (Ap horizon)

2) Argillic horizon - the zone from 12 to 38 inches. (Bt
   horizons)

3) Lithic contact - at 38 inches.

4) Particle size control section - the zone from 12 to 32
   inches.
