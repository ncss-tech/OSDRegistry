CLAYHAM SERIES

The Clayham series consists of very deep, well drained soils with moderately slow permeability that formed on stream terraces of the Coastal Plain.  This soil formed in clayey fluvial and marine sediments.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, kaolinitic, thermic Ultic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Clayham loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes--cultivated field.  (Colors are for moist soil.)

     Ap--0 to 4 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) loam; moderate medium granular structure; very friable; common fine and medium roots; few fine flakes of mica; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)

     Bt1--4 to 29 inches; red (2.5YR 4/6) clay; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine and medium roots; many prominent clay films on faces of peds; few fine flakes of mica; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

     Bt2--29 to 46 inches; red (2.5YR 4/6) clay loam; many medium distinct brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common prominent clay films on faces of peds; common fine flakes of mica; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 32 to 51 inches).

     BC--46 to 59 inches; yellow (10YR 7/6) sandy clay loam; many medium prominent red (2.5YR 4/6) mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine flakes of mica; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

     C--59 to 65 inches; yellow (10YR 7/8) loam; common medium prominent red (2.5YR 5/6) mottles; massive; friable; many fine flakes of mica; strongly acid.

     TYPE LOCATION: Marlboro County, South Carolina; 2.8 miles west on S.C. 34 from the junction of S.C. 34 and S.C. 38 in Brownsville; 1.9 miles south on Rogers Lake Lane; 0.2 mile east of road.

     RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is 40 to more than 60 inches.  Silt content averages more than 30 percent in the control section.  There are few to many flakes of mica throughout.  Mottles that occur in the B and C horizons are not redoximorphic features.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout, except where limed.

The A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  Eroded areas have an Ap horizon that is sandy clay loam or clay loam.

The Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles in shades of red, brown, or yellow are in the lower part of the Bt horizon in most pedons.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.

The BC horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles in shades of red, brown, or yellow range from few to many.  It sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.

The C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8, with few to many mottles in shades of red, brown, or yellow, or it is mottled in these colors.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.

COMPETING SERIES: The Redsprings series is the only other known series in the same family.  Other soils in similar families include the Brantley, Canton Bend, Capshaw, Cowton, Enon, Gundy, Hallsummit, Hampshire, Maben, Magnet, Mecklenburg, Skyuka, Spray, Zion, and Zuber series.  All of these soils except Redsprings have mixed mineralogy.  Redsprings soils formed from weathered glauconitic material, and have iron and glauconitic gravel, mainly in the A horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Clayham soils are on nearly level to gently sloping areas on stream terraces of the Southern Coastal Plain.  These soils formed on broad flood plains in a low energy environment where the silt and clay were able to settle out of the slow moving flood waters.  Mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 48 inches near the type location.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hornsville, Masada, Molena, Riverview, Smithboro, State, and Wickham soils.  All of these soils except Riverview have a base saturation less than 35 percent.  Riverview soils are Inceptisols.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: About 70 percent of this soil is used for crops and pasture, and the rest is mainly in forest. Common trees are loblolly pine, sweetgum, red maple, hickory, and oaks.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coastal Plain of South Carolina, and possibly Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia.  The series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Marlboro County, South Carolina, 1993.

REMARKS: This soil was formerly mapped with the Flint series, and more recently with the Wickham series.  Series format was updated 4-2022 along with removal of an offensive soil series name replaced with Hallsummit.

Diagnostic features and soil properties recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of 4 inches.  (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon - the zone between 4 and 46 inches.  (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
