COOLYORK SERIES

The Coolyork series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from chloritic schist, mudstone and sandstone.  Coolyork soils are on mountains and slopes range from 5 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1500 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Coburg series. Coburg soils formed in clayey mixed alluvium and are on stream terraces. Coburg soils have mollic horizons greater than 50 centimeters thick. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Coolyork soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes are 5 to 75 percent. Elevations are 60 to 1200 meters. These soils are derived from chloritic schist, mudstone, and sandstone. Coolyork soils are on linear and concave positions on mountain slopes and in drainage areas, and often have hummocky relief. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1250 to 2280 millimeters. Mean January temperature is about 7 degrees C, mean July temperature is about 21 degrees C, and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 14 degrees C. Frost free season is about 220 to 280 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Tannin, Yorknorth, and Burgsblock soils.  Tannin and Burgsblock soils contain less than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section and are on linear to concave or convex mountain slopes.  Burgsblock soils contain more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section and are on linear to convex mountain slopes. Yorknorth soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 15 degrees C or greater and occur under grassland vegetation on linear and concave positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained, high to very high runoff, moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for commercial timber production, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Natural vegetation includes Oregon white oak, California, buckeye, tanoak, madrone, and Douglas-fir, with an understory of annual and perennial grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Siskiyou-Trinity Area, MLRA 5. The series is moderately extensive.
