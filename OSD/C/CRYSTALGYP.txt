CRYSTALGYP SERIES

The Crystalgyp series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium or residuum from gypsiferous sedimentary rocks.  Crystalgyp soils are on dissected relict lake beds.  Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, gypsic, thermic Typic Haplogypsids

TYPICAL PEDON: Crystalgyp sandy loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 1 inch; gray (10YR 5/1) cryptogams, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) sandy loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; weak thin platy structure under the lichens; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many fine vesicular pores; many fine gypsum crystals throughout; noneffervescent to slightly effervescent in spots, 7 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (1 to 2 inches thick)

    By--1 to 10 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) sandy loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; few fine tubular pores; many very fine and fine gypsum crystals throughout; noneffervescent to slightly effervescent in spots; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

    Cy1--10 to 17 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; common fine roots; few fine tubular pores; common fine gypsum filaments; common fine and medium soft and hard gypsum masses; many very fine and fine crystalline gypsum clusters, weakly cemented together between seams; noneffervescent to slightly effervescent in spots; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary.

    Cy2-- 17 to 30 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common fine roots matted between seams; few fine tubular pores; common fine gypsum filaments; common fine and medium soft and hard gypsum masses; many very fine and fine crystalline gypsum clusters, weakly cemented between seams; noneffervescent to slightly effervescent in spots; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Cy horizons is 15 to 25 inches)

    Cr--30 to 60 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) weathered gypsiferous sandstone, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; noneffervescent to slightly effervescent in spots.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Zalvidea (CA) series. Zalvidea soils are somewhat poorly drained with a water table at 5 feet or more.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Crystalgyp soils are on dissected relict lake beds at elevations of 3,800 to 4,100 feet.  Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium or residuum from gypsiferous sedimentary rocks.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December to February.  The mean annual air temperature is 60 to 67 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 190 to 230 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Monzingo, Redington, Ugyp, Borderline and Contention soils.  All these soils are very deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to very rapid runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation includes black grama, creosotebush, tobosa, bush muhly, alkali sacaton and whitethorn.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Arizona.  Crystalgyp soils are of moderate extent.  MLRA is 41.
