COILS SERIES

The Coils series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to a strongly cemented duripan. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed volcanic and sedimentary rocks. Coils soils are on fan piedmonts. Slopes are 0 to l5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Haploxeralfic Argidurids

YPICAL PEDON: Coils loam-rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 8 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky, and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine vesicular pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (8 to 15 cm thick)

    A2--8 to 13 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 13 cm thick)

    Bt1--13 to 23 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine angular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common medium, fine, and very fine roots; common fine and very fine tubular pores; common faint and few distinct clay films on peds; 10 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 20 cm thick)

    Bt2--23 to 51 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium angular blocky; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few medium, and common fine and very fine roots; few fine and very fine tubular pores; many prominent pressure faces on peds; 10 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary. (25 to 38 cm thick)

    Btk--51 to 66 cm; yellow (10YR 7/6) gravelly clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine tubular pores; common faint and few distinct clay films in pores and on peds; 15 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (8 to 15 cm thick)

    Bqkm--66 to 94 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) strongly cemented very gravelly duripan, very pale brown (10YR 7/4) moist; massive; extremely hard, very firm; few fine and very fine roots in vertical and horizontal cracks in the duripan; few very fine interstitial pores; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual smooth boundary.

    Bqk--94 to 152 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive with strongly cemented portions; hard, very firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine interstitial pores; 35 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).

TYPE LOCATION: Eureka County, Nevada; approximately 34 miles northwest of Eureka near Coils Creek; about 50 feet west and 1,400 feet south of the northeast corner of Section 32, T. 23 N., R. 49 E.; USGS Three Bar Ranch 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 49 minutes 13 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 28 minutes 41 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.8202778 latitude, -116.4780556 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist in winter and spring, dry in early June through October; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.
Depth to duripan: 50 to 100 cm, commonly 56 to 76 cm.
Reaction: Neutral or slightly alkaline.

Particle-size control section - Clay: 35 to 45 percent.
Rock fragments: 5 to 20 percent.

A horizon
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3.

Bt horizon
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR.
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist.
Texture: Clay loam, gravelly clay loam, clay, or gravelly clay.

Btk horizon
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist.
Chroma: 4 through 6.
Texture: Clay loam or gravelly clay loam.
Clay: 30 to 40 percent.
Rock fragments: 10 to 25 percent, mostly gravel. Effervescence: Slightly effervescent or strongly effervescent.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Timblin series. Timblin soils have an E horizon and are moist for short periods in the summer.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Coils soils are on fan piedmonts. These soils formed in mixed alluvium weathered from volcanic and sedimentary rocks. Slopes are 0 to l5 percent. Elevations are 1,895 to 2,135 meters. The climate is cool, semiarid with moist winters and dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 8degrees C, and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Decan, Handy, and Vicu soils. Decan soils have a mollic epipedon and an indurated duripan.  Handy and Vicu soils lack a duripan.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, low Douglas rabbitbrush, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North-central Nevada. These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 28B.
