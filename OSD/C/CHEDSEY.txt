CHEDSEY SERIES

The Chedsey series consists of well drained soils formed in calcareous material weathered residually from calcareous red bed shale and loamstones.  Chedsey soils are on hills, ridges, and mountain side slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic Ustollic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Chedsey loam - grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 3 cm; undecomposed organic material principally grass and grass roots.

    A--3 to 18 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/2) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (13 to 23 cm thick)

    E--18 to 36 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/3) loam, brown (7.5YR 5/3) moist; weak thick platy structure that parts to fine subangular blocks and then to medium granules; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; 10 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 30 cm thick)

    Bt--36 to 79 cm; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) heavy clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular and angular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, sticky, plastic; peds are extremely hard, very firm; continuous wax-like coatings on faces of peds and wax-like coatings and fillings in root channels and pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary.  (13 to 89 cm thick)

    Bk--79 to 94 cm; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) light clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly plastic, slightly sticky; peds are very hard, firm; discontinuous wax-like coatings on some faces of peds and in some root channels; 5 percent gravel; visible secondary calcium carbonate occurring as concretions and in thin seams and streaks; calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 25 cm thick)

    Cr--94 to 155 cm; soft reddish brown shales and interbedded loamstones; calcareous.

TYPE LOCATION:  Jackson County, Colorado; about 150 meters west and 375 meters north of SE corner of Sec. 6, T. 11 N., R. 81 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Mean annual soil temperature--4 degrees C
Mean summer soil temperature--11 degrees C
These soils are dry in some part of the moisture control section for some period of nearly every year.
Base saturation--60 to 100 percent in all subhorizons of the argillic horizon
Depth to continuous horizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate accumulation--30 to 90 cm
Depth to paralithic contact--50 to 100 cm
Depth to top of argillic horizon--35 to 100 cm
Rock fragment content--0 to 35 percent, mainly gravel

A horizon
Hue--10YR through 5YR
Value--4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma--1 through 3
Reaction--pH 6.6 to 7.8

E horizon
Hue--10YR through 2.5YR
Value--5 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist
Chroma--1 through 4
Reaction--pH 6.6 go 7.8

Bt horizon
Hue--5YR through 10R
Value--5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist
Chroma--2 through 6
Texture--heavy clay loam or light clay
Clay content--35 to 60 percent
Sand content--15 to 55 percent, with more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand
Reaction--pH 6.6 to 8.4

Bk and C horizons 
Hue--5YR through 10R.  Subhorizons yellower than 5YR are present in some pedons. 
Reaction--pH 7.9 to 9.0
Calcium carbonate equivalent--3 to 14 percent

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Pagosa and Siesta series.  Pagosa soils lack a paralithic contact within a depth of 100 cm and have hue of 7.5YR or yellower.  Siesta soils lack an E horizon and are noncalcareous throughout.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform--hills, ridges, and mountain side slopes
Elevation--2500 to 2750 meters
Slope--2 to 40 percent
Parent material-residuum weathered from calcareous red bed shales and loamstones
Mean annual precipitation--380 mm with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer
Mean annual air temperature--2 degrees C
Mean summer air temperature--11 degrees C
Frost-free period--30 to 55 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally for grazing land and limited timber production.  Native vegetation is mainly sage, needlegrass, fescue, and bluegrass with widely spaced lodgepole pine, aspen, and ponderosa pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Chedsey soils are of small extent in the mountains of northcentral Colorado; MLRA 48A.
