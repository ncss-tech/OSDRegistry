CENTURIA SERIES 

The Centuria series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy glacial age alluvium over clayey lacustrine and in the underlying stratified calcareous silty and clayey lacustrine deposits on dissected glacial lake plains.  Permeability is slow.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 762 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 5.5 degrees C.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 30 to 80 centimeters (2Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3, and 2Bt4 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 152 centimeters (A, E/B, 2Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3, 2Bt4, 3C1, and 3C2 horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:
umbric epipedon--the zone from the surface to 18 centimeters (A horizon);
Argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 30 to 91 centimeters (2Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3, and 2Bt4 horizons);
Glossic horizon--the zone from a depth of 18 to 30 centimeters (E/B horizon);
aquic conditions:
* Episaturation; 18 to 53 centimeters
* Redoximorphic concentrations: 18 to 41 centimeters
* Redoximorphic depletions: 30 to 53 centimeters
lithologic discontinuity-- at the upper boundary of the 2Bt1 horizon and at the upper boundary of the 3C1 horizon;
soil moisture control section--the zone from a depth of 10 to 30 centimeters; udic moisture regime;
soil temperature control section--at a depth of 50 centimeters; frigid soil temperature regime;

Carbonates are not visually recognizable in the stratified layers and are only evident through application of 1N HCl. The level of effervescence varies with each stratum and the carbonates are assumed to be depositional.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar red clayey soils in the area.
