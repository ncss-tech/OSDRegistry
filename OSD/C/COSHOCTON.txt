MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  MORGANTOWN, WEST VIRGINIA

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Little Mill Creek Watershed, Coshocton County, Ohio, 1940. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 18 cm (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 25 to 69 cm (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)
Redox depletions with chroma 2 or less--the zone from 36 to 147 cm

This revision eliminates colluvium as a parent material for the Coshocton series.  Workers involved in recent Soil Survey updates believe this soil is derived from residuum.  Future MLRA update work on this series will include addressing Coshocton where historically mapped in colluvial landform positions.

The 06/2000 revison included numerous changes made to all parts of OSD.  Pedon description was updated to current redoximorphic feature terminology.

Previous revisions: 03/89-DRM; 06/2000-DRM,LER; 02/2005-DHK

ADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to sample pedon CS-5 (OSD type location) for characterization data. Other sampled pedons include CS-6, CS-30, MS-S5, and TU-W8. These samples were analyzed by the Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory, Columbus, Ohio.
