CALLISBURG SERIES

The Callisburg series consists of deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on uplands.  These gently sloping to
sloping soils formed from beds of clay and clay shale.  Slopes
range from 1 to 8 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, thermic Udic Paleustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Callisburg fine sandy loam--idle cropland.
                (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     Ap--0 to 6 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) fine sandy
loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable; few worm casts; common fine
roots; medium acid; clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 17 inches thick)

     B21t--6 to 19 inches; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) sandy clay, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; few fine faint yellowish red
mottles; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; clay skins on faces of peds; few fine pebbles of quartz; few
roots; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (3 to 16 inches
thick)

     B22t--19 to 31 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy clay, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; common medium distinct red (2.5YR 4/8), strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), and pale brown (10YR 6/3) mottles; moderate
medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; few fine black concretions; few fine pebbles of quartz; strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (7 to 21 inches thick)

     B23t--31 to 44 inches; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) sandy clay, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; many coarse distinct red (2.5YR
4/8), yellowish brown (10YR 5/8), and light gray (10YR 7/1)
mottles; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm;
few pockets of uncoated sand; some ped surfaces are covered with uncoated sand; common fine pebbles of ironstone; medium acid;
gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 28 inches thick)

     B3--44 to 65 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/8), red (2.5YR 4/8), and light gray (10YR 7/1) sandy clay; weak coarse blocky structure; hard, firm; clay skins on faces of some peds; few
pockets of uncoated sand; some ped surfaces are covered with
uncoated sand; neutral.

TYPE LOCATION:  Cooke County, Texas.  From intersection of Farm
Road 372 and Farm Road 922 at Mountain Springs; north 0.3 mile on Farm Road 372; east 3.1 miles on County Road; north 0.1 mile; 30
feet west of road, in field.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from 60 to more than
100 inches thick.  Fine pebbles of ironstone and quartz range from none to about 5 percent by volume throughout the solum.  Black concretions range from none to common throughout the solum.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and
chroma of 2 to 8.  A thin A2 horizon 2 to 6 inches thick and one
or two units of value higher than the A1 or Ap horizon occurs in
some pedons.  The A horizon is fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand.  It is medium acid to neutral.

The B21t has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of
3 to 6.  The B22t and B23t horizons have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y,
value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Few to common mottles in colors and shades of red, yellow, brown, and gray occur in the Bt horizon mainly in the lower part of most pedons.  The gray mottles are believed to be inherited from the parent materials.  The B21t
is sandy clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay, or clay and is strongly acid to neutral.  The B22t and B23t horizons are sandy clay or
clay.  The average clay content in the upper 20 inches of the Bt ranges from 35 to 50 percent.  Reaction of the lower part of the
B2t ranges from strongly acid through neutral.  Few to common uncoated sand grains on faces of peds and few pockets of uncoated sand grains occur in the lower Bt.

The B3 horizon has the same colors as the Bt or is mottled.
Reaction ranges from strongly acid through mildly alkaline.  Some pedons contain soft carbonates, generally below depths of 50
inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chigley, Hamby, Minwells, Pedernales, Truce, Voca, Windthorst and Winters series in the same family and the similar Bastrop, Chaney, Miles, Payne, Rader, and Travis series.  Chigley soils have more than 10 percent coarse fragments in the Bt and have redder hues.  Hamby and Minwells
soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the Bt horizon and, in
addition, Minwells soils have a gravelly substratum.  Pedernales
and Winters soils have Cca horizons.  Truce, Voca, and Windthorst soils have sola less than 60 inches thick.  Bastrop and Miles
soils have fine-loamy control sections.  Chaney soils contain
mottles due to wetness within a depth of 30 inches.  Payne soils
have montmorillonitic mineralogy.  Rader soils have a B&A horizon
and have mottles due to wetness within 30 inches of the surface.  Travis soils have base saturation of less than 75 percent in the
Bt horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Callisburg soils occupy nearly level to
gently rolling uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  The
soil formed in beds of clay and clay shale.  Mean annual
temperature is 64 degrees to 69 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 38 inches.  Thornthwaite P-E index
is 50 to 64.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Aubrey, Birome, Crockett, Crosstell, Casil, and Konsil series.  Aubrey and Birome soils have a solum 20 to 40 inches thick and are on nearby slopes
and ridges.  Crosstell soils have vertic properties and are on slightly higher elevations.  Crockett soils have vertic properties and are on similar landscapes.  Casil and Konsil soils are on low ridges and have fine-loamy control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; slow to
medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for pasture.  Principal
cultivated crops are grain sorghum, small grain, and peanuts.
Native vegetation is postoak and blackjack oak with an understory
of bluestem and other mid and tall grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North Central Texas and possibly Southeatern Oklahoma.  The series is of moderate extent.
