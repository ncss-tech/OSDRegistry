COSHO SERIES

The Cosho series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and glacial drift on valley walls and bedrock benches. Slopes are 10 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1,700 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, amorphic over isotic, frigid Typic Udivitrands

TYPICAL PEDON: Cosho gravelly ashy sandy loam, on a bedrock bench landform with a SE facing slope of 35 percent at 762 meters elevation under coniferous forest vegetation. When described on September 6, 2006 the soil was slightly moist throughout. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

	Oe--6 to 14 cm; moderately decomposed plant material; many very fine and medium and few very fine, coarse and very coarse roots; abrupt irregular boundary.

	E--14 to 15 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly ashy sandy loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; 10 percent fine gravel and 5 percent medium and coarse gravel; very strongly acid (pH 4.8); abrupt wavy boundary.

	2C--75 to 90 cm; olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) very gravelly loamy sand, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; few fine roots; 15 percent fine gravel, 15 percent medium and coarse gravel, and 15 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0).

	2R--90 cm; metavolcanic bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Caribouridge, Garveson, and Hysing soils. The Caribouridge soils have glassy over mixed mineralogy and ashy silt loam textures in the upper part of the particle-size control section. Garveson soils are very deep and have ashy silt loam textures in the upper part of the particle-size control section. Hysing soils have ashy silt loam textures in the upper part of the particle-size control section and a paralithic contact at 105 to 140 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Cosho soils are on bedrock benches and valley walls, at elevations of 230 to 780 meters. Slopes are 10 to 50 percent. These soils formed in mixed volcanic ash and glacial drift over glacial drift. The climate consists of cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1,700 to 2,500 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 5 to 10 degrees C. Frost-free season is 60 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ledeir (T), Benzarino, and Thorton (T) soils. Ledeir soils form on the more stable portions of the same landforms, have spodic horizons, and are very deep to bedrock. Benzarino soils form on less stable portions of the same landforms and have a lithic contact within 50 cm. Thorton soils form on the same landforms, are ashy over loamy-skeletal, and are very deep to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for watershed, recreation, woodland, and wildlife habitat. Potential natural vegetation consists of western hemlock, Douglas-fir, and western redcedar with an understory of vine maple, Oregon-grape, serviceberry and, twinflower.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western slopes of the North Cascade Mountains, Washington. MLRA 3. Series is of moderate extent.
