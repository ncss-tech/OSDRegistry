CHRISTY SERIES

The soils of the Christy series are Brown soils. They range from light brown to brown in color, usually with a pinkish or reddish tinge. The subsoils are lighter brown and calcareous. They are derived from old stream-laid calcareous deposits which now occupy high rolling terraces at elevations of 6,700 to 7,000 feet. Usually well-rounded gravel is a mark of the soils and in places is sufficiently numerous to constitute gravelly types. Also intermittent caliche hardpan may underlie the types. The Soils have developed under a bunch grass and sagebrush cover in a climate characterized by long cold winters with much snow, but, with a comparatively low annual precipitation. They resemble the Cokeville soils, with which they are associated, but are somewhat less red.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Calcic Haploxerolls
