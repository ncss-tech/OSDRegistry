CATNAPP SERIES

The Catnapp series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess derived from mixed sources over residuum derived from basalt or tuff. Catnapp soils are on plateaus. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 275 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Xeric Natrargids 

TYPICAL PEDON: Catnapp extremely cobbly loam--on the summit of a small plateau sloping 2 percent at an elevation of 1,740 meters--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. When described on October 9, 2002 the soil was dry throughout.)

(10 to 13 cm thick) 

  AE---13 to 18 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak thick platy structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, many fine, and common medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.

(5 to 25 cm thick) 

   Btn2--23 to 36 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and common fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; few prominent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 13 cm thick) 

     Btkn--36 to 64 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine roots; common fine tubular pores; few prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay films on faces of peds; secondary carbonates segregated in filaments; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt irregular boundary. (5 to 28 cm thick) 

     R---64 cm; basalt.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Disabel series. Disabel soils are very deep. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Catnapp soils are on plateaus. They typically occur on summit positions. These soils formed in loess derived from mixed sources over residuum derived from basalt or tuff. These soils occur downwind of a salty playa (Summer Lake) and frequently receive new deposits of loess high in sodium salts. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,465 to 1,770 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brace and Raz soils. Brace and Raz soils have duripans. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; high surface runoff; slow permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Catnapp soils are used for livestock grazing. The vegetation is shadscale, low sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg's bluegrass, and Thurber's needlegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Oregon. These soils are not extensive with about 840 acres of the series mapped to date. MLRA 23.
