COMO SERIES

The Como series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from coarse grained igneous and sedimentary rock.  These soils occur on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 10 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 760 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed Typic Haplocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Como very gravelly sandy loam, forested. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

   Oi--0 to 6 cm; slightly decomposed forest litter; clear smooth boundary. (4 to 10 cm thick)

   A--6 to 18 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 40 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 15 cm thick)

   Bw--18 to 46 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very gravelly sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 50 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear wavy boundary. (15 to 30 cm thick)

   BC--46 to 72 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loamy sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 50 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary. (20 to 50 cm thick)

   C--72 to 152 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely gravelly loamy sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; 65 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid. (pH 6.0)
