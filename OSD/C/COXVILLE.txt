COMPETING SERIES:
Grady soils--Conceptually, Grady soils have a weighted average of 45 to 65 percent clay in the particle-size control section and Coxville soils have 35 to 45 percent.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses: Forest, some pasture and cropland
Dominant Vegetation: Where cultivated--corn, soybeans, and truck crops. Where wooded--loblolly and longleaf pine, sweetgum, blackgum, water oak, willow oak, water tupelo, elm, and hickory.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Distribution: Coastal Plain of North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and possibly Virginia and Louisiana
Extent: Large

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Pitt County, North Carolina; 1909.

REMARKS: There appears to be no significant difference in soil characteristics or properties of the Grady and Coxville soils that warrants separation at the series level. Each series was proposed before 1910 by the respective states (Georgia and North Carolina) and they have been maintained since.  They were separated on clay and silt content in the 1960s. However, Coxville have not been consistently correlated with less than 45 percent clay (or 30 percent silt) in the particle-size control section..

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 11 inches (Ap and Eg horizons)
Albic horizon--the zone from 9 to 11 inches (Eg horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone between depths of 11 and 72 inches (BEg, Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, and Btg4 horizons)
