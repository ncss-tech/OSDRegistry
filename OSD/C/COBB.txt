COBB SERIES

The Cobb series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in residuum derived from sandstone. These nearly level to moderately sloping soils occur on ridges. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm (25 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 17.2 degrees C (63 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, thermic Typic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Cobb fine sandy loam, in a cultivated field.
    (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

Abilene series: These soils have a mollic epipedon and occur on lower alluvial or footslope positions.
Cosh and Spikebox series: These soils are shallow to sandstone bedrock and occur on slightly convex positions higher in the landscape.
Decobb series: These soils are very deep to sandstone and occur slightly lower in the landscape.
Grandfield and Miles series: These soils occur on slightly lower positions and have developed in loamy, Pleistocene age alluvial sediments.
Spade series: These soils occur on similar positions, have a cambic horizon, and are calcareous to the surface.
Tillman and Westill series: These soils have a mollic epipedon, a fine textured particle-size control section, and occur on slightly lower positions.
Bluegrove, Tilvern and Vernon series: These soils occupy similar to slightly lower landscape positions and have a fine textured particle-size control section. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderate. Runoff is negligible on slopes less than 1 percent, low on 1 to 5 percent slopes and medium on 5 to 8 percent slopes. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for rangeland. Native vegetation is mainly grasses such as sideoats grama, blue grama, little bluestem, dropseed, threeawn, Arizona cottontop, and buffalograss. Mesquite trees are the dominant woody plants. A small acreage is farmed. Grain sorghum, cotton, and wheat are the major crops.
