CONEJOS SERIES

The Conejos series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived from tuff and breccia.  Conejos soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 5 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 810 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 1.7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, isotic Vitrandic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Conejos very cobbly ashy silt loam, on a north-facing, 35 percent slope in coniferous forest at an elevation of 3,110 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on July 19, 1983 the soil was moist throughout. Texture, gravel content and pH are from NSSL data.

    Oa--0 to 5 cm; highly decomposed forest litter.

    E--5 to 38 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very cobbly ashy silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; 25 percent gravel, 15 percent cobble; very strongly acid (pH 4.9); clear smooth boundary. (20 to 40 cm thick)

    E/B--38 to 51 cm; 55 percent pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly ashy silt loam (E), brown (10YR 5/3), moist; 45 percent brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely gravelly ashy sandy clay loam (Bt), brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 60 percent gravel, 15 percent cobble; moderately acid (pH 5.6); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 25 cm thick)

    Bt1--51 to 122 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very cobbly ashy sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm, very hard, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; 30 percent gravel, 25 percent cobble; moderately acid (pH 5.7); gradual wavy boundary.  

    Bt2--122 to 160 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very gravelly ashy sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; moderately sticky and slightly plastic; 35 percent gravel, 10 percent cobble; slightly acid (pH 6.1). (combined thickness of Bt1, Bt2 horizons is more than 36 cm)

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES PROPOSED:  Rio Grande County, Rio Grande National Forest, West Part soil survey area, 2006. The name Conejos is taken from a nearby river and county. Pronunciation is Con-ay-hohs.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  8 to 152 cm
Particle-size control section:  38 to 88 cm (Upper 50 cm of the Bt horizon) 
Argillic horizon:  38 to 160 cm (E/B, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons) 
Vitrandic feature:  5 to 51 cm (E and E/B horizons)

Clay contents are calculated from 1500 kPa water and organic carbon.

Conejos soils have a cryic temperature regime and an udic soil moisture regime. 

ADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL sample S84CO105-001 (sampled as Granile).
