SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Yakima County, Washington; 1947

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon
*Mollic epipedon--zone from the surface to a depth of 25 cm
*Particle-size control section--zone from 25 to 100 cm

It is assumed that these soils have an irregular decrease in organic carbon content as depth increases.
