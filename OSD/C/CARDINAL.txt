CARDINAL SERIES

The Cardinal series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in glaciolacustrine sediments on dissected Wisconsin age lake plains and terraces. Permeability is moderately slow in the upper part of the solum and slow in the lower part. Slopes range from 6 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 990 millimeters, and the mean annual temperature is about 9.5 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Banister, Branchville, Celina, Eudy, Hartville, Jerktail, Loudon, Tarlton, and Whippany soils. The Banister, Hartville, Jerktail soils have a mean annual temperature greater than 11 degrees C. The Branchville, Celina, and Loudon soils have more than 2 percent rock fragments in the lower solum. Eudy and Tarlton soils have bedrock at 50 to 100 centimeters. Whippany soils have an elevation of greater than 182 meters above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Cardinal soil is on shoulders, back slopes, and foot slopes of dissected Wisconsin age lake plains and terraces. The soils formed in glaciolacustrine sediments. Slope ranges from 6 to 50 percent. Elevations are from 219 to 396 meters mean sea level. The mean annual temperature ranges from 8.3 to 10.5 degrees C. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 864 to 1092 millimeters. The frost free period is 133 to 167 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Canadice, Caneadea, Darien, Fitchville, Glenford, Otego, Pierpont, Platea, and Stanhope soils. The moderately well drained Glenford soil, the somewhat poorly drained Caneadea and Fitchville soils, and the poorly drained Canadice soil are on adjacent lacustrine terraces. The moderately well drained Pierpont soil and the somewhat poorly drained Darien and Platea soils are on adjacent till plains. The moderately well drained Otego and the poorly drained Stanhope soils are on flood plains. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. The potential for surface runoff is medium to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low in the upper part of the solum and low in the lower part. Depth to an intermittent perched water table is 45 to 64 centimeters from December to April in most years. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are wooded. Original vegetation was deciduous forest. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Ohio. Eastern Ohio Till Plain. 
MLRA 139. Distribution is of small extent, about 3,000 acres. 

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia. 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Ashtabula County, Ohio, 2001. 

REMARKS:
Soils mapped as Steep land, silty and clayey, in the Ashtabula County soil survey, published 1973, were converted to the Cardinal series during the modernization project of that survey. 

Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include: Ochric epipedon - from a depth of 0 to 33 centimeters (A, E, and BE horizons).
Argillic horizon - from a depth of 33 to 86 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 and Bt4 horizons).
Aquic conditions - begin at a depth of 56 centimeters. 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to pedon AB-128 for characterization data on the typical pedon, samples 26851 - 26861 from Ashtabula County, Ohio; samples analyzed by the Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory, Columbus, Ohio.
