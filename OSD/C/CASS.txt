CASS SERIES

The Cass series consists of deep, well drained soils. They formed in alluvium on floodplains in Central Nebraska Loess Hills, MLRA 71, Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (53 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 660 millimeters (26 inches) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Fluventic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Cass fine sandy loam - on a 1 percent southeast-facing slope in a cultivated field. When described, the soil was moist throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  Ap--0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. (15 to 23 centimeters (6 to 9 inches) thick)

  A--18 to 30 centimeters (7 to 12 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft; very friable; neutral; gradual smooth boundary. (10 to 28 centimeters (4 to 11 inches) thick)

  AC--30 to 51 centimeters (12 to 20 inches); gray (10YR 5/1) fine sandy loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; soft; very friable; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 38 centimeters (0 to 15 inches) thick)

  C1--51 to 119 centimeters (20 to 47 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable; neutral; diffuse wavy boundary. (25 to 76 centimeters (10 to 30 inches) thick)

  C2--119 to 152 centimeters (47 to 60 inches); very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; loose; neutral.

TYPE LOCATION: Hall County, Nebraska; about 11.3 kilometers (7 miles) north of Doniphan, Nebraska; 396 meters (1,300 feet) east and 213 meters (700 feet) south of the northwest corner, sec. 17, T. 10 N., R. 9 W.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Darr series.
Darr soils have mixed sand and gravel between a depth of 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alda, Huscher, Inavale, Leshara and Wann soils. 
Alda soils are on similar landform positions, and can have a seasonal water table at as shallow as 46 centimeters (18 inches).
Huscher soils are on similar landform positions, and have less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser sands in the particle size control section.
Inavale soils are on similar landform positions and have a sandy particle size control section. 
Leshara soils are generally on slightly lower landforms and are wetter and greater than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section.
Wann soils are on similar landform positions, have a water table within 100 centimeters (40 inches) most years.
