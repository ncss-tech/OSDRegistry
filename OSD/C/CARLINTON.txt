CARLINTON SERIES

The Carlinton series consists of moderately deep to a fragipan, moderately well drained soils on hills and ridges on basalt plateaus or on mountain slopes and canyon benches. They formed in material weathered from loess and reworked loess with an influence of volcanic ash. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high above the fragipan and moderately low through the fragipan. Slope ranges from 2 to 40 percent. The average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 27 inches.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Carlinton soils are on loess-covered hills, mountains, basalt plateaus and benches. Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent. These soils formed in loess and reworked loess with an influence of volcanic ash at elevations of 1,100 to 4,500 feet (335 to 1372 meters). The average annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 46 degrees F, with an average annual precipitation of 22 to 45 inches (559 to 1143 mm). The average frost-free period is from 80 to 125 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cavendish, Kauder, Kruse, and Taney soils. Cavendish and Kruse soils do not have a fragipan, are fine-loamy and are on convex areas. Kauder soils have a udic moisture regime and are on flat or concave areas. Taney soils have a mollic epipedon and are on concave slopes and northwest exposures. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity above the fragipan and moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity through the fragipan. There is a seasonally perched water table at depths of 14 to 36 inches from February to May. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for timber production, hay, pasture, livestock grazing, and some areas of dry cropland production. Potential natural vegetation is mainly grand fir, Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, western larch, Pacific yew, with an understory of creambrush oceanspray, common snowberry, myrtle pachystima, mallow ninebark and American trailplant. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The series is moderately extensive.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are: 

Ochric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 11 inches (Oi, A and AB horizons). 

Argillic horizon - The zone from 22 to 62 inches (B/E, Btxb1 and Btxb2 horizons). 

Fragipan- The zone from 35 to 62 inches (Btxb1 and Btxb2 horizons). 

Oxyaquic feature - the zone beginning at 22 inches having saturation with water for 30 or more cumulative days. 
Particle-size control section - The zone from 22 to 35 inches (B/E horizon). 

Depths to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral layer.
