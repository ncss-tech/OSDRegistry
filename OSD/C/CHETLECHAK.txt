REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features in this pedon
*Particle-size control section--zone from 33 to 108 cm
*Ochric epipedon
*Redoximorphic iron concentrations--C horizon
*Redoximorphic iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less--C horizon
*Permafrost--Cf horizon
*Aquic conditions--C horizon
Soils in this series may sometimes meet the criteria for a mollic epipedon, but this horizon is not diagnostic within the Aquorthels great group.
