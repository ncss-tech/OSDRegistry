CEBOYA SERIES

The Ceboya series consists of deep, very poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in fine-textured alluvial sediments of mixed origin. These soils are on broad, mountain valley flood plains and have slopes from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ceboya silty clay loam, on the flood plain adjacent to the Mora River. (Colors are for moist soils unless otherwise stated.)

    Oe--0 to 3 cm; dense sod of decomposing material and fibrous roots.

    A1--3 to 26 cm; very dark gray (5Y 3/1) silty clay loam, dark gray (5Y 4/1) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many fine, very fine and medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; few fine mica flakes; slightly effervescence; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (20 to 36 cm thick)

    A2--26 to 39 cm; very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) heavy silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) dry; few fine distinct olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) mottles, reddish brown (2.5YR 5/4) dry; massive; very hard, firm, sticky and very plastic; many fine, very fine and medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; few fine mica flakes; slightly effervescence; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary. (0 to 15 cm thick)

    Cg1--39 to 62 cm; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) heavy silty clay loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) dry; many large prominent light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) mottles, olive yellow (2.5Y 6/6) dry; massive; very hard, firm, sticky and very plastic; many fine, very fine and medium roots; few fine mica flakes; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary. (20 to 30 cm thick)

    Cg2--62 to 108 cm; dark gray (N 4/) silty clay, gray (N 5/) dry; common medium prominent light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) mottles, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) dry; massive; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; many fine, very fine and medium roots; few very fine tubular pores; few fine mica flakes; slightly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. (25 to 50 cm thick)

    Cg3--108 to 156 cm; dark gray (N 4/) clay, gray (N 5/) dry; few fine distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) mottles, olive yellow (2.5Y 6/6) dry; massive; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; few fine mica flakes; 5 percent quartz gravel; slightly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Mora County, New Mexico; in the Village of Mora, about 120 meters south of NM highway 3 along fence line in NE  sec. 14, T. 20 N., R. 15 E., in the Mora Land Grant.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
These soils have a fluctuating water table at depths of 0 to 1 meter.
Some pedons have a B horizon, and most pedons have fine mica flakes.

A horizon
Hue--neutral, 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y
Value--3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma--0 through 2
Texture--silty clay loam, but the range includes clay loam, silt loam, and loam

C horizon
Hue--neutral, 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y
Value--4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist
Chroma--0 through 2
Texture--silty clay loam or clay loam in the upper part and silty clay or clay in the lower part
Rock fragment content--0 to 10 percent quartz gravel in the lower part

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Brycan and Saladon series in other families. Brycan soils have fine-loamy control sections. Saladon soils have cryic temperature regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform--level to nearly level, broad mountain valley flood plains along major drainageways
Elevation--2200 to 2600 meters
Slope--0 to 3 percent
Parent material--fine-textured alluvial sediments of mixed origin
Mean annual precipitation--410 to 510 mm
Mean annual air temperature--6 to 8 degrees C
Frost-free period--90 to 110 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained; runoff is very slow and ponded on most areas during high rainfall periods; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of the Ceboya soils are used for grazing livestock. Some areas have been developed for housing and small commercial buildings. Vegetation is mainly redtop, blue grama, saltgrass, and water-tolerant grasses and sedges.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Ceboya soils are of small extent in northern New Mexico. MLRA 48A.
