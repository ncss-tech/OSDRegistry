CROOKSTON SERIES

The Crookston series consists of very deep, well drained soils. The Crookson soils are on lake terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual temperature is 47 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Calcic Pachic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Crookston loam, cultivated.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap--0 to 6 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) moist; mixed weak medium subangular blocky and weak fine subangular structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; noncalcareous; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

    A--6 to 14 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; common fine pores; noncalcareous; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 11 inches thick)

    Bt--14 to 27 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; common fine and medium pores; few faint clay films; noncalcareous; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 15 inches thick)

    Ck1--27 to 48 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; common fine and medium pores; strongly calcareous; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 21 inches thick)

    Ck2--48 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) fine sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and medium pores; strongly calcareous; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  Cache County, Utah; about 2 miles north and 1/2 mile west of Newton; 500 feet north and 40 feet east of the southwest corner of section 6, T.13N., R.1W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The average annual soil temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F., and the average summer soil temperature at 20 inch depth for more than 60 consecutive days during the summer months in more than 7 out of 10 years.

The mollic epipedon is 20 to 28 inches thick. The combined thickness of the A and Bt horizons over the Ck horizon ranges from 20 to 28 inches.

The A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to less than 2.  It has weak to moderate, fine to medium granular or subangular blocky structure.  This horizon is 7 to 19 inches thick.  It contains 2.4 to 4 percent organic matter.

The Bt horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam to silt loam, marginal to fine sandy loam with more than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  This horizon has weak to moderate, fine to medium subangular blocky structure.  It has common faint clay films occurring mainly in pores and as bridges between sand grains.  

The Ck horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay loam to fine sandy loam.  The Ck horizon has lime content of 25 to 35 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Mendon, Newell, Roystone, and Timpanogos.  Newell and Newell soils have silty clay loam argillic horizons. Roystone soils lack calcic horizons.  Medon soils have clay loam argillic horizons with less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  Timpanogos soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick, with chroma of 2 or more, and have argillic horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Crookston soils are on nearly level to strongly sloping, smooth to gently rolling lake terraces at elevations of 4,500 to 5,100 feet.  Gradients are dominantly 0 to 3 percent and range to 8 percent.  Parent materials are light colored tuff, conglomerate, tuffaceous sandstone and limestone of the Salt Lake formation.  The climate is moist subhumid with an average annual precipitation of about 15 to 18 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F., and the average summer temperature is 65 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 120 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Avon, Collinston, and Wheelon soils and the competing Mendon soils.  Avon soils have clay argillic horizons.  Collinston soils lack argillic horizons  and have calcic horizons immediately below the mollic epipedons.  Wheelon soils lack both mollic epipedons and argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderate to slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Primarily used as dry cropland of small grains and alfalfa.  Where irrigation water is available, locally adapted crops are grown.  The native vegetation is big sagebrush, western wheatgrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, balsamroot, and associated plants.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Utah and possibly adjoining states.  These series are inextensive.
