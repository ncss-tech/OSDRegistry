CAHOON SERIES

The Cahoon series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in outwash over till derived from granitic rocks. The Cahoon soils are on moraines and outwash plains of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1000 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bindle (MLRA 6) and Mineralking soils. Bindle soils formed in mixed ash, loess, and colluvium from mafic volcanic rocks, and have a lithic contact between 50 and 100 cm. Mineralking soils formed in colluvium from metasedimentary rocks, are well drained, and have subangular or angular fragments.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Cahoon soils are on linear backslopes and footslopes of moraines and outwash plains on plateaus. Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent. These soils formed in outwash over till derived from granite and granodiorite. Elevation is 2065 to 3175 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 440 to 1345 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 3 to 7 degrees C. The frost free season is 80 to 115 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hockett and Kanawyer soils. The Hockett soils are on linear to concave structural benches of glacial valley-floors, and have a lithic contact between 50 and 100 cm. The Kanawyer soils are on linear to convex moraines and have a densic contact between 100 and 150 cm.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained, low to moderate saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Vegetation is Sierra lodgepole pine, threadleaf sedge, western needlegrass, squirreltail, and Ross's sedge.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. These soils are of limited extent.
