CANUELA SERIES

The Canuela series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in eolian material and slope alluvium over residuum derived from rhyolitic tuff.  Canuela soils are on summits and beveled summits of interfluves on undulating plateaus and mesas.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Aridic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Canuela paragravelly sandy loam--on a summit of an interfluve sloping 2 percent to the north at 6,638 feet elevation-rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. When described on September 14, 2000, the soil was dry throughout.) Surface is covered with 20 percent paragravel and 5 percent paracobbles.

     A--0 to 2 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) paragravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grain; loose, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many fine and common very fine roots; 15 percent paragravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick)

     Bt1--2 to 7 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) paragravelly clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few coarse, few medium, common fine, and common very fine roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent paragravel and 10 percent paracobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual smooth boundary. (3 to 8 inches thick)

     2Bt2--7 to 15 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very paracobbly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few coarse, few medium, few fine, and few very fine roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 25 percent paragravel and 30 percent paracobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick)

     2Cr--15 to 25 inches; moderately cemented rhyolitic tuff bedrock (Bandelier Tuff formation)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - The soil moisture control section is moist in all parts during the 60 days following the winter solstice. It is moist in some part less than 40 percent and moist in all parts less than 25 percent of the time when the soil temperature at 20 inches is above 41 degrees F. The soils are driest in May and June. The soil moisture regime is ustic bordering on aridic.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Canuela soils are on summits and beveled summits of interfluves on undulating plateaus and mesas. They formed in eolian material and slope alluvium over residuum derived from rhyolitic tuff of the Quaternary age Bandelier Tuff formation. Slopes are 2 to 6 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,900 to 7,100 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 11 to 16 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 130 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Abrojo, Armenta, Chiminet, and Zacaton soils. Abrojo soils are very deep and are on backslopes of interfluves. Armenta soils are very deep and are on footslopes of interfluves.  Chiminet soils are very shallow and are on backslopes of interfluves.  Zacaton soils are very deep and are on backslopes of interfluves.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium surface runoff; permeability is moderate and moderately slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: Canuela soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat.  The historic climax vegetation is blue grama, needleandthread, skunkbush sumac, and twoneedle pinyon.  The ecological site is Pinus edulis-Juniperus monosperma/Cercocarpus montanus-Chrysothamnus nauseosus/Bouteloua gracilis(F036XB135NM). 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Canuela soils are of small extent on the southwestern Espanola Basin part of the Basin and Range province in northcentral New Mexico. The MLRA is 36.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Santa Fe County, New Mexico; Santa Fe Area Soil Survey Update, 2008. Series proposed in Los Alamos County, New Mexico, Bandelier National Monument Soil Survey, 2000.  Canuela is a Spanish surname. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 2 inches. (A horizon)
Argillic horizon - The zone from 2 to 15 inches. (Bt1 and 2Bt2 horizons)
Paralithic contact - at 15 inches. (2Cr layer)

Note: This soil has moderate amounts of volcanic glass in the coarse silt plus sand fractions.  It has less volcanic ash than other nearby less developed soils because of the influence of introduced eolian materials. Even though lower horizons contain more glass than upper horizons, it does not contain enough glass to make a Vitritorrandic subgroup.
