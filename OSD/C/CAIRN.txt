CAIRN SERIES

The Cairn series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in slope alluvium, alluvium and residuum derived from limestone and sandstone on summits of structural benches and dipslopes of gently dipping cuestas.  Slopes are 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cairn soils are on summits of structural benches and dipslopes of gently dipping cuestas.  The formed in alluvium and residuum derived from thinly bedded, dolomitic Cretaceous limestone and sandstone.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent. Elevation ranges from 4,900 to 5,400 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain from high intensity thunderstorms between July and October.  The mean annual temperature is 51 to 54 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 140 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Nageezi, Patel, Persayo, and Razito soils.  Nageezi and Razito soils are coarse-loamy and sandy respectively, and occur in adjacent alluvial and eolian deposits.  Patel soils are fine textured and moderately deep to soft bedrock on hillslopes below Cairn soils.  Persayo soils are shallow to soft bedrock on hillslopes above Cairn soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability

USE AND VEGETATION:  Cairn soils are used for livestock grazing.  Present vegetation is Indian ricegrass, galleta, sand dropseed, shadscale, Castle Valley clover, winterfat, and pricklypear cactus.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Cairn soils are of small extent on the Four Corners Platform portion of the Colorado Plateau in northwest New Mexico and southwest Colorado. MLRA 35.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 2 inches (A horizon).

Argillic horizon - The zone from 2 to about 9 inches (Btk horizon).

Calcic horizon - The zone from 9 to about 19 inches (2Bk horizon).

Gypsic Horizon - The zone from 19 to about 30 inches (2Cky horizon).

Paralithic contact - The presence of soft sedimentary bedrock at about 46 inches.

Particle-size control section - The zone from the top of the argillic horizon to a depth of 40 inches (Btk, 2Bk, 2Cky, and 2Cy horizons).

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Salinity values were determined on three pedons, including the type location, with a Wheatstone bridge.  Calcium carbonate equivalence determined with a field volume calcimeter.
