COLMENA SERIES

The Colmena series consists of very deep, moderately permeable, well drained soils that formed in loamy sediments over calcareous loamy alluvium of Quaternary age.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on side slopes of Paleoterrace remnants.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 22.2 degrees C (72 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm (26 inches).
