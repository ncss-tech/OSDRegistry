COMMISSARY SERIES

The Commissary series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from sandstone and shale. These soils are on hillslopes and mountain slopes. Slopes are 4 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 500 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 1.2 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic Ustic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Commissary gravelly silt loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

 A--0 to 9 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly silt loam, very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many fine, very fine, common medium and coarse roots throughout; many very fine irregular pores; 20 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 10 cm thick) 

 Bt1--9 to 30 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/3) gravelly silty clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, firm, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; common fine, medium and many very fine roots throughout; common fine and very fine dendritic tubular pores; 30 percent gravel; 20 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (18 to 24 cm thick)

 Bt2--30 to 76 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/3) very gravelly clay, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very firm, very sticky, very plastic; common fine, medium and many very fine roots throughout; common fine and many very fine dendritic tubular pores; 45 percent gravel; 25 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.  (42 to 50 cm thick)

 C--76 to 121 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/3) very gravelly clay, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; hard, very firm, very sticky, very plastic; many very fine dendritic tubular pores; 55 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (40 to 50 cm thick) 

 Cr--121 cm; shale bedrock.
