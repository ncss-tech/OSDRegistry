CABELL SERIES

The Cabell series consists of very deep, well-drained soils on sideslopes of moraines. Cabell soils formed in volcanic ash overlying till from mixed rocks, dominantly of soft tuffs. Slopes are 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and mean annual temperature about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, isotic Andic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cabell ashy silt loam - forested, on a 20 percent east-facing slope at an elevation of 5,320 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

 Oi--0 to 1 inch; slightly decomposed needles.

 Bw--1 to 14 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) ashy silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine, common medium, and few coarse roots; common fine irregular and few fine tubular pores; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (7 to 13 inches thick)

 2Eb--14 to 22 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly sandy loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium, and few coarse roots; few fine irregular, and common fine and medium tubular pores; 15 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, and 3 percent stones; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary.

 2Btb--29 to 49 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly sandy clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; weak coarse subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine and medium angular blocky; hard, firm, very sticky and moderately plastic; continuous thin clay films on ped faces and common moderately thick clay films on ped faces; few fine roots; few fine vesicular pores; 20 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual smooth boundary. (15 to 20 inches thick)

 2BCb--49 to 61 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; massive; hard, firm, very sticky and moderately plastic; few fine vesicular pores; 20 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.3).
