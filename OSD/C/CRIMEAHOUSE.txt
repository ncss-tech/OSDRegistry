COMPETING SERIES: These are the Idriapeak (MLRA 15) series. Idriapeak soils are on mountain slopes at elevations of 794 to 1,598 meters and a frost-free period of 150 to 200 days. Because of the higher elevation and shorter growing season, they are likely to have a soil moisture control section that is dry in all parts from June to October.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Crimeahouse soils are on backslopes and footslopes of hills. Slopes range from 10 to 60 percent. These soils formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from serpentinite. Elevation is 200 to 650 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 550 to 850 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 15 to 17 degrees C. The frost free season is 230 to 330 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Fancher and Sixbit soils. The Fancher soils have greater than 35 percent clay and less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section, and occur on footslopes and backslopes. Sixbit soils have a lithic contact within 50 cm and occur on shoulders, backslopes, and footslopes. 
DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately high to high saturated hydraulic conductivity from 0 to 45 cm and moderately low to moderately high from 45 to 82 cm. Saturated hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock is moderately low to high.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed, and homesite development.  Vegetation is buckbrush, foothill pine, chamise, and serpentine-endemic forbs such as rawhide hill onion, red hills soap plant and Hartweg's doll's-lily.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Foothills in California; MLRA 18. The series is not extensive.

REMARKS:
  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
     Ochric Epipedon         0 to 8 cm
     Argillic Horizon           8 to 82 cm
     Lithic Contact              82 cm
  Particle Size Control Section for this pedon: 8 to 58 cm.

Magnesic minerology: The fraction of Mg silicate minerals is inferred to be greater than 40% by mass in the control section fine earth fraction based on laboratory data collected from geographically-associated serpentine soils. Chlorite, talc and serpentine-subgroup clays (e.g. chrysotile, antigorite, lizardite) are strongly represented in the clay fractions. Sand fractions have substantial amounts of serpentine or mafic minerals (pyroxene, hornblende, and iron oxides) that are associated with  the serpentinization process.
