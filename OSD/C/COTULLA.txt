COTULLA SERIES 

The Cotulla series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous, saline-sodic, clayey residuum derived from mudstone. These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on foot slopes and side slopes of broad interfluves. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 559 mm (22 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 21.7 degrees C (72 degrees F).
