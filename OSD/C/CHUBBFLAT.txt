CHUBBFLAT SERIES

The Chubbflat series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from loess and other mixed sources. Chubbflat soils are on valley floors. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 500 millimeters, and the mean annual air temperature is about 2.2 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive Aquic Cumulic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Chubbflat silt loam on nearly level west, concave, 0.5 percent slope, on pastureland at an elevation of 1950 meters. When described on June 15, 1977, the soil was moist below 20 centimeters and saturated below 91 centimeters. (Color is for air dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

 A1--0 to 20 cm; black (10YR 2/1) silt loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine irregular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary. 

 A2--20 to 56 cm; black (10YR 2/1) silty clay loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and common fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent (12 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary. (combined thickness of the A horizon is 50 to 75 cm thick) 

 Bkg1--56 to 66 cm; gray (10YR 5/1) silty clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; finely disseminated and 2 percent fine irregular masses of secondary calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent (29 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); 2 percent fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) iron masses; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. 

 Bkg2--66 to 102 cm; gray (10YR 6/1) silty clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; finely disseminated and 10 percent fine irregular masses and seams of secondary calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent (28 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); 2 percent fine prominent brown (7.5YR 5/4) iron masses; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual wavy boundary. (combined thickness of the Bkg1 and Bkg2 horizons is 40 to 100 cm thick) 

 Bkg3--102 to 152 cm; light gray (10YR 7/1) gravelly silty clay loam, gray (10YR 5/1) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine, fine and common medium tubular pores; finely disseminated and 5 percent fine irregular masses and seams of secondary calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent (37 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); 2 percent fine distinct light brown (7.5YR 6/3) iron masses; 20 percent gravel; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8). 

TYPE LOCATION: Caribou County, Idaho; about 1.3 kilometers south of the Grays Lake Guard Station and 380 meters east of Grays Lake Road; about 100 meters south and 1170 meters east of the northwest corner of section 2, T. 5 S., R. 43 E.; Bear Island, USGS topographic quadrangle; latitude 43 degrees 01 minutes 12.9 seconds north and longitude 111 degrees 22 minutes 43.3 seconds west, NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Mean annual soil temperature: 1.7 to 3.9 degrees C. 
Mean summer soil temperature: 12 to 15 degrees C. 
Thickness of mollic epipedon: 50 to 70 cm. 
Depth to secondary calcium carbonates: 20 to 60 cm. 
Depth to apparent water table: 50 to 90 cm, from April toJuly. 

Particle-size control section: 
Clay content: averages 25 to 32 percent. 

Oi: (present in some pedons) 

A horizons: 
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR 
Value: 2 to 4 dry 
Chroma: 1 or 2 dry 
Clay content: 18 to 30 percent 
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 15 percent 
Reaction: 7.3 to 8.0 

Bkg1 and Bkg2 horizons: 
Value: 4 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist 
Chroma: 1 or 2 dry or moist 
Texture: Silt loam or silty clay loam 
Clay content: 20 to 34 percent 
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 10 to 35 percent 
Reaction: 8.0 to 8.8 

Bkg3 horizon:

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landscape: Valleys 
Landform: Valley floors 
Elevation: 1860 to 2075 meters 
Slope: 0 to 2 percent 
Parent material: Silty alluvium from loess and alluvium from mixed sources 
Mean annual air temperature: 0.6 to 3.3 degrees C 
Mean annual precipitation: 450 to 600 millimeters 
Frost free period: 30 to 65 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Crowcreek, Enochville, Lantonia and Rin Series. Crowcreek, Lantonia and Rin soils do not have redoximorphic features and are on higher positions of same landform as Chubbflat soils. Enochville soils do not have secondary calcium carbonates and occupy positions lower than Chubbflat. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage class: Somewhat poorly 
Runoff: Low 
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: Moderately high 
Ponding: Rare from April through June 

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Major uses: Pasture and some grass hay 
Vegetation: Clover, sedges, rushes, and water tolerant grasses 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Idaho; MLRA 44B. The series is of small extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana 

SERIES PROPOSED: Caribou County, Idaho, 1993. The name is taken from the valley area in which the soil was first described. 

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic properties recognized in the typical pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 66 cm 
Calcic horizon: 66 to greater than 150 cm 
Particle-size control section: 25 to 100 cm 
Cumulic feature: the soil meets mollic requirements to a depth exceeding 50 cm and has an irregular decrease in organic carbon. 

In 2009 the Chubbflat type location was moved based on the results of a soil temperature study indicating the original location is frigid.
