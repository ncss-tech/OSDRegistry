COMPETING SERIES: These are the Kartar and Nevat series.  The Bestrom,Cassolary, Hudnut, Koerling, Koseth, and Scala series have similar classification with mixed mineralogy. Kartar soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments (weighted average in the control section) and do not have lamellae. Nevat soils are 40 to 60 inches to a lithic contact and are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days.  Bestrom soils are 20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact.  Cassolary soils have aquic conditions with chroma of 2 and redox concentrations within 20 inches and do not have lamellae. Hudnut soils do not have E&Bt horizons. Koerling soils have 2Bk horizons (calcareous lake sediments) with sandy loam to silty clay loam textures at a depth of 24 to 40 inches. Koseth soils have calcareous loamy-skeletal glacial till in the lower 2C horizon and do not have lamellae. Scala soils have Bw horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Clayton soils are on terraces at elevations of 1,800 to 2,400 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent. These soils formed in moderately coarse mixed glaciofluvial deposits mixed with loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Average January temperature is 24 degrees F, average July temperature is 68 degrees F. The average annual temperature is 46to 50 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 17 to 22 inches. The frost-free period is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Battleplain, Hagen and Phoebe soils. Battleplain soils are on terraces, have a mollic epipedon and are sandy in the particle-size control section. Hagen soils are on terraces, have an ochric epipedon and are sandy in the particle-size control section. Phoebe soils are on terraces and have a pachic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for crop production, homesites, woodland, and wildlife habitat. Small grains, alfalfa and grass are the principal crops. Some areas are used for hay and pasture. Potential natural vegetation is ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine , with an understory of pinegrass, common snowberry, Oregon-grape, strawberry, rose, white spirea, common yarrow and kinnikinnick.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern Washington and possibly northern Idaho; MLRA 43A, 44A. The series is moderate in extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Stevens County, Washington, 1913.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 8 inches (Ap1 and Ap2 horizons)
Cambic horizon - the zone from 8 to 52 inches (Bt part of the E and Bt horizons)
Vitrandic feature - the zone from 0to 8 inches (Ap1 and Ap2 horizons)
Lamellae - the zone from 8 to 62 inches (E&Bt horizons)
Particle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches (E&Bt1 horizon and part of theE&Bt2 horizons)

The classification of this series has been revised as of 5/2000 from coarse-loamy, mixed, mesic Vitrandic Xerochrepts to coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Vitrandic Haploxerepts based on revision to Soil Taxonomy.

Lab data for Clayton series, pedon numbers 40A1033 and 40A1034 used to confirm base saturation of greater than 60 percent. Ongoing soil temperature data is being collected for this series to confirm soil temperature regime for Spokane County. Based on vegetation, this area is borderline mesic and possibly frigid.

Mineralogy changed to isotic 10/2001.

The 10/2003 update reflects a move in the type location to a mesic location in Spokane County.  The type location in Stevens county is frigid and will be correlated to the Stapaloop series.

Investigation of Clayton mapped in Pend Oreille County, WA.,(SSA's WA651 and perhaps the Panhandle NF 752) is needed to evaluate the mesic/frigid soil temperature regime break.

The 9/2009 revision reflects an update to the use and vegetation section to better represent a mesic plant community.
