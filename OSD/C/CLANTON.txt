CLANTON SERIES

The Clanton series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in 15 to 40 centimeters of silty or loamy sediments and in the underlying residuum from reddish, acid, Pennsylvania shale.  These soils are on the lower part of convex side slopes and escarpment-like areas that border major streams.  Slope ranges from 9 to 35 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 940 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, illitic, mesic Mollic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Clanton silt loam, on a northeast-facing slope of 15 percent, in a deciduous forest.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 A--0 to 20 centimeters; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) silt loam, brown (7.5YR 5/2) dry; weak fine platy and weak fine granular structure; friable; few peds of reddish brown (5YR 4/3) mixed in lower part; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (15 to 23 centimeters thick)

 E--20 to 28 centimeters; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) silt loam, light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) dry; weak medium platy structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; friable; common fine tubular pores; pink (5YR 7/3) dry, silt and fine sand coats on faces of peds; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 15 centimeters thick)

 2Bt1--28 to 43 centimeters; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) silty clay; moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; very firm; common fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.

 2Bt2--43 to 74 centimeters; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) silty clay; moderate fine angular blocky structure; very firm; common fine tubular pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; very strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the 2Bt horizon is 30 to 60 centimeters.)

 2BC--74 to 96 centimeters; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) silty clay loam; weak coarse platy structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky (structure partly inherited from the shale); very firm; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (20 to 30 centimeters thick)

 2C--96 to 152 centimeters; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) silty clay loam; weak medium platy rock structure inherited from the shale; firm; common fine prominent light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) redoximorphic concentrations; neutral.

TYPE LOCATION: Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) 108D-Illinois and Iowa Deep Loess and Drift, Western Part, Madison County, Iowa subset; about 2 miles west and 2 miles north of Truro; located about 1,380 feet west and 1,900 feet south of the northeast corner of section 6, T. 74 N., R. 26 W.; USGS East Peru topographic quadrangle; lat. 41 degrees 14 minutes 18 seconds N. and long. 93 degrees 53 minutes 25 seconds W; NAD83.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material--15 to 40 centimeters of silty or loamy sediments and in the underlying residuum from reddish, acid, Pennsylvania shale
Landform--the lower part of convex side slopes and escarpment-like areas that border major streams
Slope--9 to 35 percent
Elevation--200 to 460 meters above sea level
Mean annual air temperature--9 to 12 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation--840 to 1,040 millimeters
Frost-free period--175 to 210 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Gara, Gosport, Ladoga, and Nordness soils.
Gara--are at a higher landscape positions on side slopes, have a clay content that averages 30 to 35 percent in the particle-size control section and have a sand content that averages 25 to 45 percent in the particle-size control section
Gosport--are on similar landscape positions as those of the Clanton soils and do not have an argillic horizon
Ladoga--are at a higher landscape positions on summits of interfluves and side slopes and have a sand content of less than 5 percent throughout the series control section
Nordness--are at slightly higher landscape positions and have a lithic contact with limestone within a depth of 50 centimeters

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--moderately well drained--a frequently saturated zone occurs at a depth of 1.2 meters during the wettest periods of normal years, due to the matrix colors of the parent material, drainage class is difficult to determine, some areas may be seasonally wet because of side hill seeps
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--0.01 to 0.10 micrometers per second
Surface runoff potential--very high

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are wooded and pastured.  The native vegetation is big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, other grasses of the tall grass prairie and widely spaced oak and hickory trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Physiographic Division--Interior Plains
Physiographic Province--Central Lowland
Physiographic section--Dissected till plains
MLRAs--Illinois and Iowa Deep Loess and Drift, Western Part (108D) and Iowa and Missouri Heavy Till Plain (109)
LRR M; Southern Iowa
Extent--small
