COOKSON SERIES  

The Cookson series consists of moderately deep and deep, well drained soils on ground moraines.  They formed in loamy glaciofluvial or eolian deposits over loamy glacial till underlain by limestone bedrock.  Slope ranges from 1 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, active, frigid Alfic Haplorthods

TYPICAL PEDON: Cookson silt loam in an area of Cookson-Amadon silt loams 1 to 6 percent slopes in a forested area at an elevation of 211 meters.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

	Oi--0 to 8 centimeters; slightly decomposed forest litter; extremely acid.

	E--8 to 18 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 4/2) silt loam; gray (7.5YR 6/1) dry; weak medium subangular blocky parting to weak coarse granular structure; friable; common fine, few medium and coarse roots; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 10 centimeters thick)

	Bhs--18 to 28 centimeters; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) silt loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine, few medium and coarse roots; about 2 percent fine and medium gravel; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 10 centimeters thick)

	2Bs--28 to 41 centimeters; dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) sandy loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine and medium roots; about 7 percent fine, medium and coarse gravel; moderately acid; abrupt broken boundary.  (10 to 25 centimeters thick)

	2E/Bt--41 to 53 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, light gray (7.5YR 7/1) dry (E); occupies about 85 percent of the horizon surrounding reddish brown (5YR 4/3) fine sandy loam (Bt); moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots; many fine vesicular pores; about 2 percent fine and medium gravel; moderately acid; clear irregular boundary.  (8 to 25 centimeters thick)

	2Bt--53 to 79 centimeters; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) sandy clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots; many fine vesicular pores; few faint dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) clay films on faces of peds; about 2 percent fine and medium gravel; neutral; clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 30 centimeters thick)

	2C--79 to 91 centimeters; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam; massive; firm; about 5 percent fine, medium and coarse gravel; moderately alkaline; strong effervescence; abrupt smooth boundary.

	3R--91 centimeters; hard, fractured limestone bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Alcona, Cheboygan, and Greylock series. These soils do not have bedrock above 203 centimeters. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - ground moraines underlain by limestone or dolomitic sandstone at a depth of 76 to 127 centimeters.
Slope - 1 to 50 percent
Mean annual precipitation - 710 to 810 millimeters
Mean annual air temperature - 3 to 5 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Cookson soils are associated with Amadon, Trenary, Menominee, and Tawas soils.
Amadon - are on similar landscape positions and in the Lithic Haplorthods Subgroup.
Trenary - are on similar landscape positions and in the semiactive cation-exchange activity class.
Menominee - are on similar landscape positions and in the sandy over loamy particle-size class.
Tawas - are in depressions and in the Terric Haplosaprists Subgroup.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class  There is no water saturation above the bedrock (well drained).
Runoff - low to very high depending on slope
Saturated hydraulic conductivity - moderately high to high

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of this soil is in woodland.  Major tree species include sugar maple, basswood, white ash, aspen, and ironwood.  Common ground plants include sweet cicely, downy yellow violet, sedges, twisted stalk, and spinulose shield fern.
