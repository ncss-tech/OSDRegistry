CHOCKNOTT SERIES

The Chocknott series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils on alluvial fans, drainageways, flood plains and stream terraces of a lava plateau.  These soils formed in alluvium from pumice.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chock, Tonata and Tutni series.

Chock soils have ashy loam or ashy sandy loam texture in the lower portion of the particle-size contol section.

Tonata soils have a mollic epipedon and silt loam fine earth textures.

Tutni soils are 14 to 20 inches deep to aquic conditions

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landscape - lava plateau
Landform - alluvial fans, drainageways, flood plains, and stream terraces
Elevation - 4525 to 5500 feet 
Slope - 0 to 4 percent 
Parent material - alluvium from Mt Mazama pumice 
Climate - cold moist winters and cool dry summers 
Mean annual air temperature - 41 to 45 degrees F
Mean January air temperature - 25 to 27 degrees F
Mean July air temperature - 57 to 60 degrees F 
Mean annual precipitation - 18 to 36 inches
Frost-free period - 0 to 20 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Lapine and Wickiup soils.  Lapine soils are on adjacent plateaus.  They formed in volcanic ash and pumice, are excessively drained and have a xeric moisture regime.  Wickiup soils are in nearby depressions.  They are poorly drained and average greater than 35 percent pumice paragravel in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage - poorly drained 
Permeability - rapid
Flooding - occasional to very frequent
Ponding - frequent
Water table - an apparent water table is at its uppermost limit form May to July

USE AND VEGETATION:  Regcrust soils are used for wildlife habitat, watershed and recreation.  The potential natural plant community is the grass-sedge-forb meadow plant association group (MDMW).  The tufted hairgrass plant association (MM19-12), Baltic rush plant association (MW39-12) and widefruit sedge plant association (MM29-13) are commonly supported.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Klamath County, Oregon; MLRA 6.  Series is of small extent.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Andic soil properties form 0 to 17 inches (the A1 and A2 horizons)
Particle-size control section from 0 to 40 inches (the A1, A2, Bwc and portion of the BCc horizons)

Aquic conditions, endosaturation on 16 September 1998 from 80 to 160 cm (portion of the Bwc2 horizon)

Aquic moisture regime

Cryic temperature regime

Umbric epipedon  0 to 17 inches

Contrast between the upper and lower portions of the particle-size control section does not meet criteria for a strongly contrasting particle-size class.
