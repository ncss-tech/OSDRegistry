CONNERTON SERIES

The Connerton series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvium and slope alluvium derived from red sedimentary rock. Connerton soils are on relict stream terraces, fan aprons, hill toeslopes and footslopes of strike valleys. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Torriorthentic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Connerton loam-rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 13 cm; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; slightly effervescent, lime disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 30 cm thick)

    AB--13 to 25 cm; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; strongly effervescent, lime disseminated and as few soft masses and filaments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth boundary. (8 to 20 cm thick)

    C--25 to 152 cm; reddish brown (2.5YR 5/4) loam, reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; strongly effervescent, lime disseminated; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Johnson County, Wyoming; NE1/4, NE1/4 of sec. 11, T. 42 N., R. 84 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Mean annual soil temperature - 8.3 to 11.7 degrees C
Mean summer soil temperature ranges - 15 to 17.8 degrees C
Mollic epipedon - 18 to 51 cm thick
Organic carbon content - 0.8 to 2.5 percent in the mollic epipedon, decreasing uniformly with depth
Calcium carbonate equivalent - 1 to 8 percent throughout

Particle-size control section (weighted average): 
Texture: typically loam or clay loam
Clay content - 18 to 35 percent
Sand content - 20 to 50 percent sand with less than 35 percent but more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser
Electrical conductivity - less than 4 mmhos throughout
Rock fragments - typically less than 5 percent but may range from 0 to 15 percent gravel

A horizon 
Hue: 2.5YR through 7.5YR
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: loam, fine sandy loam
Reaction: pH 7.9 to 9.0

AB horizon
Hue: 2.5YR through 7.5YR
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: loam, fine sandy loam, clay loam
Reaction: pH 7.9 to 9.0
Note: A stronger grade of structure is required and an increase in clay is common.

C horizon
Hue: 5YR through 10R
Value: 4 through 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 2 through 4
Reaction: pH 7.9 to 9.0
Note: Inconsistent pedogenetic carbonates occur in some pedons. 

COMPETING SERIES: 
Nucla (CO) - have hue yellower than 7.5YR
Ralphston (NM) - have hue yellower than 7.5YR
Tarryall (CO) - are moderately deep to bedrock

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform - relict stream terraces, fan aprons, hill toeslopes and footslopes of strike valleys
Elevation - 1,450 to 2,100 meters
Slopes - 0 to 15 percent 
Parent material - calcareous alluvium and slope alluvium derived from redbed sediments
Mean annual air temperature - 7 to 9 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation - 280 to 410 mm
Precipitation pattern - About half the precipitation falls as snow or rain in April, May and early June.  
Frost-free period - 110 to 150 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Connerton soils are used principally as rangeland, pasture, hayland and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation consists of bluebunch wheatgrass, western wheatgrass, big sagebrush, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Connerton soils are of moderate extent in central Wyoming and along the eastern front of the Rocky Mountains in northern Colorado; MLRA 49.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Southern Johnson County Area, Wyoming; 1971.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - 0 to 25 cm (A and AB horizons)
Particle-size control section - 25 to 100 cm (C horizon)

Connerton soils have a mesic soil temperature regime and an ustic soil moisture regime bordering on aridic.
