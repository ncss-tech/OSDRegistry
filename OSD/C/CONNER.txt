CONNER SERIES

The Conner series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum derived from sandstone and rhyolite with loess influence.  Conner soils are on mountain slopes and shoulders of canyons and have slopes of 12 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 7.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Conner very gravelly loam on a mountain slope with 46 percent slope at an elevation of 2,061 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The surface is covered by 20 percent gravel, 20 percent channers and 5 percent stones.

 A--0 to 27 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/2) very gravelly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and common fine and medium roots; 30 percent gravel and 20 percent channers; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (22 to 33 cm thick)

 Bk--27 to 55 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; calcium carbonate coats on bottoms of 80 percent of rock fragments; 20 percent carbonate masses throughout; 50 percent gravel, 25 percent channers and 10 percent flagstones; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (20 to 70 cm thick)

 R--55 to 66 cm; sandstone bedrock; common medium roots in cracks; calcium carbonate coats on 90 percent of fractures in the bedrock; violently effervescent.

TYPE LOCATION: Teton County, Idaho; about 6.4 km southeast of Victor; 127 meters north and 423 meters west of the southeast corner of section 20, T. 3 N., R. 46 E.; Victor USGS topographic quadrangle; lat. 43 degrees, 33 minutes, 52.5 seconds N. and long. 111 degrees, 3 minutes, 2.4 seconds W., NAD83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Mollic epipedon thickness: 22 to 33 cm
Depth to calcic horizon: 22 to 33 cm
Calcium carbonate equivalent in the calcic horizon: 15 to 30 percent
Depth to bedrock: 50 to 100 cm
Particle size control section total clay: 15 to 18 percent
Particle size control section rock fragments average: 60 to 85 percent
Reaction: neutral to moderately alkaline
Mean annual soil temperature: 6.1 to 8.0 degrees C. (frigid soil temperature regime)
Mean summer soil temperature: 15.0 to 19.4 degrees C.
Soil moisture regime: Xeric; dry in all parts for 45 to 90 consecutive days in the summer and fall.

A horizon(s):
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR moist or dry
Rock fragments: 40 to 55 percent total; 20 to 40 percent gravel, 0 to 20 percent channers, 0 to 20 percent cobbles, 0 to 5 percent flagstones and 0 to 5 percent stones

Bk horizon(s):
Value: 4 or 5 moist
Fine-earth texture: L or SL with 60 to 85 percent total fragments; 20 to 55 percent gravel, 0 to 30 percent channers, 0 to 30 percent cobbles, 10 to 40 percent flagstones and 0 to 25 stones

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bailey(T), Buist, Conneridge, Cooley, Dagan, Hondoho, Ireland, Jebo, Niarada, Pedleford and Tuckerdowns series.  Bailey(T), Buist, Cooley, Dagan, Hondoho, Niarda and Tuckerdowns soils are very deep.  Conneridge soils are continuously dry in all parts for over 90 consecutive days in the summer and fall.  Ireland, Jebo and Pedleford soils do not have flagstones in the particle size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: mountains and plateaus
Landform: mountain slopes and shoulders of canyons
Elevation: 1,822 to 2,313 meters
Slope: 12 to 60 percent
Parent material: residuum derived from sandstone and rhyolite
Mean annual air temperature: 6.0 to 9.0 degrees C.
Mean annual precipitation: 457 to 711 mm
Frost free period: 50 to 100 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Beehunt and Pinochle soils. Beehunt and Pinochle soils occur on the same landform.  Beehunt soils are very deep and occur on more concave positions.  Pinochle soils do not have a calcic horizon and are on more linear positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class: well
Runoff: high
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: moderate

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major uses: rangeland and wildlife habitat
Dominant native vegetation: Mountain big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, arrowleaf balsamroot

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Distribution: Southeastern Idaho and Western Wyoming, MLRA 13
Extent: the series is not extensive
