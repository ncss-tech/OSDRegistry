CROSSCAN SERIES

The Crosscan series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and shale.  Crosscan soils are in canyons and on hills.  Slopes range from 6 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic, shallow Ustic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Crosscan very bouldery sandy clay loam, on a northeast facing, convex, 35 percent slope in pinyon juniper woodland at an elevation of 6,235 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The surface is covered by 2 percent boulders.

    A--0 to 2 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) very bouldery sandy clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 25 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones, and 2 percent boulders; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear wavy boundary.  (1 to 8 inches thick)

    AC--2 to 9 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very gravelly clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; 25 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 12 inches thick)

    C--9 to 18 inches; variegated colors (5YR to 2.5Y) very gravelly clay loam, weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; 25 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones; disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); abrupt wavy boundary.  (4 to 12 inches thick)

    Cr--18 inches; calcareous shale.

TYPE LOCATION: Montezuma County, Colorado; Cortez Area Soil Survey; located about 1,190 feet east and 1,950 feet north of the southwest corner of sec. 30, T. 37 N., R. 17 W.; Woods Canyon, Co  USGS quad; lat. 37 degrees 25 minutes 57 seconds N. and long. 108 degrees 46 minutes 03 seconds W., NAD 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture regime: aridic bordering on ustic
Soil temperature regime: mesic
Mean annual soil temperature: 52 to 54 degrees F
Depth to paralithic contact: 6 to 20  inches 
Reaction: slightly or moderately alkaline

Particle-size control section: 27 to 35 percent clay

A horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR to 2.5Y
Value: 4 to 6 (3 or 4 moist)
Chroma: 2 to 4
Rock fragments: 35 to 60 percent gravel cobble and stone 
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 5 percent

C horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR to 2.5Y
Texture: loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam
Rock fragments: 35 to 60 percent, gravel, cobble and stone 
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 15 percent
EC (mmhos/cm): 0 to 2 

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Espinos series.  Espinos soils have secondary carbonates.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and shale
Landform: canyons and hills
Slopes: 6 to 80 percent
Elevation: 5,400 to 6,800 feet
Mean annual temperature: 50 to 52 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 10 to 14 inches
Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year with July and August being slightly wetter and June being slightly dryer. 
Frost-free period: 120 to 135 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Romberg series.  Romberg soils are very deep and have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: well drained, high or very high runoff, slow permeability

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used principally for wildlife habitat and livestock grazing.  Dominant vegetation in the potential plant community are pinyon, juniper, mountain mahogany, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwest Colorado.  LRR D, MLRA 36.  The series is of moderate extent.
