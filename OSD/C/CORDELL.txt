CORDELL SERIES

The Cordell series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained, moderately over very slowly permeable soils that formed in residuum weathered from hard, calcareous siltstone of the Doxey Formation of Permian age. These very gently sloping to steep soils occur on interfluves and side slopes of hillslopes. Slope ranges from 1 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, active, thermic Lithic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Cordell silt loam, on a southeast-facing, 3 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 569 m (1,867 ft).
