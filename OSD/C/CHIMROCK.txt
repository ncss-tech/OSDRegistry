CHIMROCK SERIES

The Chimrock series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from shale and sandstone.  Chimrock soils are on alluvial fans, fan piedmonts, and plains.  Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Typic Argigypsids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Chimrock very fine sandy loam, on a southwest facing, 3 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 5,290 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    A--0 to 3 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate very thick platy structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots throughout; common very fine vesicular pores; strongly effervescent; 1 percent gravel;  moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick)  

    AB--3 to 15 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots throughout; few very fine dendritic tubular pores; very few distinct clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 10 percent calcium carbonate; 1 percent gravel; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); gradual smooth boundary. 

    Bt--15 to 32 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots throughout; few very fine dendritic tubular pores; few distinct clay films on faces of peds and in pores; common fine carbonate threads throughout; 11 percent calcium carbonate;  1 percent gypsum; 1 percent gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); abrupt wavy boundary. (10 to 24 inches thick)

    By--32 to 46 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine gypsum threads throughout; gypsum pendants beneath coarse fragments; 9 percent calcium carbonate;  5 percent gypsum; 5 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (6 to 20 inches thick)

    C--46 to 66 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine gypsum threads throughout; 9 percent calcium carbonate; 2 percent gypsum; 3 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Fruita (CO), Fruitvale (CO) and Yogovuci (CO) series.  Fruita soils have more than 15 percent by weight gypsum in the gypsic horizon
Fruitvale soils have clayey substrata. Yogovuci soils are derived from eolian deposits and igneous materials and have lithologic discontinuities with stratified sandy and sandy-skeletal substratum.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium derived from shale and sandstone
Landform:  broad alluvial fans
Slopes:  0 to 3 percent
Elevation:  4,800 to 5,700 feet
Mean annual temperature:  52 to 56 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation:  7 to 10 inches
Precipitation pattern:  Uniform with slight dip in May and June and slight increase in July and August.
Frost-free period:  135 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Persayo and Ravola series, and Torriorthents.  The Persayo soils are shallow to shale and are on hills.  The Ravola soils are fine-silty and are in drainageways.  The Torriorthents soils lack development and are on sideslopes of mesas.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, negligible to low runoff, moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Rangeland.  The dominant vegetation in the potential plant community is galleta, winterfat, fourwing saltbush, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwest Colorado; MLRA 35; small extent.
