CHINKLE SERIES

The Chinkle series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and  colluvium from shale, siltstone and very fine grained sandstone.  The Chinkle soils are on hill slopes and summits.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, thermic, shallow Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Chinkle very gravelly very fine sandy loam, rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is partly covered with 50 percent pebbles and 10 percent cobbles.

     A1--0 to 2 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) very gravelly very fine sandy loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate, thin platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common fine vesicular and very fine interstitial pores; 35 percent pebbles and 5 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick)

    A2--2 to 6 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) gravelly fine sandy loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; weak thin platy structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 25 percent pebbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)

    Bk--6 to 13 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) gravelly loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; common very fine, fine and few medium roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 25 percent pebbles and 5 percent cobbles; few very thin lime coats on undersides of rock fragments; few fine threads of soft lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear irregular boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Cr--13 to 25 inches; reddish brown (2.5YR 5/4) highly fractured somewhat weathered very fine grained sandstone; few very fine, fine and medium roots along fractures; 50 percent of the rock material is weathered and fragments are easily broken with two hands; few thin lime coats in fractures; abrupt irregular boundary.  (6 to 16 inches thick)

     R--25 inches; slightly fractured very fine grained red sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lincoln County, Nevada; approximately 17 miles north-north west of Mesquite; about 2,200 feet north and 1,000 feet west of the southeast corner of section 16, T. 10 S., R. 70 E.; 37 degrees, 4 minutes, 3 seconds north latitude, 114 degrees, 10 minutes west longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Usually dry, moist in some part for short periods during winter and early spring and for very brief intermittent periods in summer and fall, 10 to 20 days cumulative following summer convection storms.

Soil temperature - 62 to 71 degrees F.

Depth to paralithic horizon:  8 to 14 inches

Depth to hard bedrock: 20 to 30 inches



Profile reaction:  Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.



Control section - Percent clay: 8 to 18 percent.

Rock fragments: 15 to 35 percent, dominantly pebbles.



A horizon - Hue: 5YR through 10YR.

Value: 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist.

Chroma:  2 through 4.



Bk horizon - Hue: 2.5YR through 10YR.

Value: 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist.

Chroma:  3 through 6.

Texture:  Gravelly fine sandy loam, gravelly very fine sandy loam or gravelly loam

Structure:  Massive or subangular blocky.

Other features:  Occurrence of free lime ranges from few to many very thin lime coats on undersides of rock fragments.  These lime coats and threads total less than 5 percent by volume of the horizon.  In some pedons this horizon lacks segregated threads or seams of soft lime.



Cr horizon - Hue: 2.5YR through 10YR.

Other features:  This horizon contains 30 to 60 percent weathered bedrock material.  Occurrence of free lime ranges from few very thin to many thin coats along bedrock fractures.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Randsburg and Solis soils.  Randsburg soils are formed in residuum from granitic rock.  Solis soils have predominantly summer precipitation.  Randsburg soil contains less than 15 percent coarse fragments.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Chinkle soils are on summits and side slopes of hills.  These soils formed in residuum from siltstone, very fine grained sandstone and shale.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 2,800 to 4,000 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cool moist winters and hot intermittently moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches; mean annual temperature is 60 to 69 degrees F. and the frost-free season is 190 to 210 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Kanackey, Zeheme and St.  Thomas soils.  Kanacky soils have an argillic horizon and a lithic contact within 20 inches.  Zeheme and St. Thomas soils have carbonatic mineralogies and a lithic contact within 20 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Rapid runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly creosotebush, white bursage, white ratany, Mohave desertrue, Nevada ephedra and golden cholla.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeast Nevada.  MLRA 30.  These soils are not extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: PHOENIX, ARIZONA
