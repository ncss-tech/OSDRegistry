CLAYMAN SERIES

The Clayman series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, slope alluvium or colluvium derived mainly from volcanic rock.  Clayman soils are on fan remnants, mountain slopes, and pediments.  Slopes range from 3 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 840 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 2.8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Pachic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Clayman loam, on an east facing, simple, 6 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 2,682 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on June 18, 1985 the soil was moist from 0 to 152 cm.

    A1--0 to 10 cm; dark brown (10YR 3/3) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many fine, very fine, and few medium roots; many fine, very fine, and few medium tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 51 cm thick)

    A2--10 to 48 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; strong medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 46 cm thick)

    Bt1--48 to 79 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; hard, friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine, and few medium tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.  (25 to 76 cm thick)

    Bt2--79 to 152 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; hard, friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few fine and very fine roots; few fine and very fine tubular pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; neutral (pH 6.6).
