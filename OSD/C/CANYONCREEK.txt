RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Laboratory analyses of adjoining soils, in addition to supporting field study place this soil in the order Andisols.  Depth to paralithic contact is 40 to 60 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 30 to 43 inches thick.  The mean annual soil temperature is 38 to 44 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 44 to 46 degrees F with a O horizon.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. from mid May to about early November and exceeds 47 degrees F. from mid July to early September.  The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from mid July to mid September (60 to 80 days) and is moist in all parts from early November to mid June.  The upper part is volcanic ash with less than 15 percent rock fragments.  The lower part is dominated by 35 to 60 percent rock fragments, mostly cobbles and stones.  NaF pH ranges from 11.5 to 9.4 decreasing with depth.  Base saturation by ammonium acetate ranges from 50 to 75 percent.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately acid throughout.

The A horizon color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/3 or 7.5YR 4/2.  Moist color is 10YR 2/2, 3/2 or 7.5YR 3/2.  Clay content ranges from 8 to 15 percent.  Rock fragments, mostly gravel, range from 0 to 15 percent.  Bulk density ranges from 0.7 to 0.85 g/cc.

The 2Bw horizon color is 10YR 4/3, 5/3; 7.5YR 5/2 or 5/4.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3, 4/3 or 7.5YR 3/2.  Texture is very stony loam, very cobbly loam, or extremely cobbly loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Canyoncreek soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. These soils formed in tephra.   Elevation is 6000 to 7100 feet.  The climate is subhumid with cool dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 20 to 25 inches. Snowfall is 48 to 72 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 38 to 43 degrees F.  The mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F.  The mean July temperature is about 55 degrees F.  Frost free season is 40 to 50 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Gosch, Hermit and Witcher soils.  Hermit soils are on mountains, are deep to a paralithic contact, and are medial over loamy.  Gosch and Witcher soils are on mountains, are deep to a paralithic contact, have an ochric epipedon and are frigid.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  This soil is used for timber production.  Small areas are used as urban development.  The natural vegetation is white fir, ponderosa pine, snowbrush, sierra chinkapin, sticky currant, and bitter cherry, ceanothus and some jeffrey pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern California.  The soils are not extensive.  MLRA is 22.
