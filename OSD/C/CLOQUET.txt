CLOQUET SERIES

The Cloquet series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in a mantle of loamy eolian or glaciofluvial deposits and the underlying gravelly outwash. These soils are on outwash plains, valley trains, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C. and mean annual precipitation is about 720 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Typic Dystrudepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Cloquet silt loam on a 4 percent convex slope under birch, aspen and hazel. Elevation of about 409 meters. Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.

    A--0 to 3 centimeters; black (N 2/0) silt loam; weak very fine and fine granular structure; very friable; many roots; few fine charcoal fragments; 3 percent rock fragments; moderately acid; abrupt wavy boundary. (2 to 10 centimeters thick)

    E--3 to 8 centimeters; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam; moderate fine granular and moderate very fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; many roots; 3 percent rock fragments; strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 10 centimeters thick)

    Bw1--8 to 20 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 4/4) silt loam; moderate very fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; many roots; 5 percent rock fragments; very strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.

    Bw2--20 to 36 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 4/4) loam; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; many roots; 10 percent rock fragments; strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bw horizons is 28 to 41 centimeters thick)

    2Bw--36 to 43 centimeters; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) gravelly loamy coarse sand; parts of horizon are massive and parts have weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few roots; 20 percent rock fragments; few thin clay films on faces of peds; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 10 centimeters thick)

    2BC--43 to 91 centimeters; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) very gravelly loamy coarse sand; single grain; loose; few roots; 40 percent rock fragments; most of the medium and coarser sand grains are stained; strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 50 centimeters thick)

    2C--91 to 203 centimeters; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) very gravelly coarse sand; single grain; loose; few roots; 50 percent rock fragments; slightly acid.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material-- a mantle of loamy eolian or glaciofluvial deposits and the underlying gravelly outwash
Landform--linear to convex slopes on outwash plains, valley trains, and glacial moraines
Slope--0 to 60 percent
The outwash sediment is from the Superior Lobe, Rainy Lobe, or is mixed from both sources of the Late Wisconsinan glaciation
Mean annual air temperature--2 to 6 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation--650 to 790 millimeters
Annual frost free period--80 to 140 days
Elevation above sea level--350 to 500 meters

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Near the type location, these are the Emmert, Gnesen, Hulligan, Rollins, and Warman soils.
Emmert--are on similar landscape positions but are in the Typic Udorthents subgroup
Gnesen--are on lower landscape positions and are in the Aquic Dystric Eutrudepts subgroup
