COBEN SERIES

The Coben series consists of very deep, well drained soil that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Vertic Argiustolls
