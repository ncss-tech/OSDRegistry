SERIES ESTABLISHED: Pasquotank County, North Carolina; 2008.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Umbric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 7 inches. (the Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon - the zone between 7 and 50 inches. (BA, Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, and BCg horizons)
Aquic conditions - colors with chroma of 2 or less below the surface layer caused by saturation.
