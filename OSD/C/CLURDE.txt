CLURDE SERIES

The Clurde series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and volcanic ash over alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Clurde soils are on fan remnants, inset fans, and lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Durinodic Xeric Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Clurde silt loam--rangeland.  (Colors for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(23 to 33 cm thick)

    2Bqk2--74 to 127 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) gravelly loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; very few very fine roots; few fine interstitial pores; 50 percent very hard, firm and brittle durinodes; 30 percent gravel; violently effervescent; secondary carbonates segregated as common fine coats on durinodes and rock fragments; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.0).

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Cluro series.  Cluro soils have redox concentrations of iron within a depth of 100 cm and have endosaturation within a depth of 180 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Clurde soils are on fan remnants, inset fans, and lake terraces.  These soils formed in loess and volcanic ash over alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,250 to 1,860 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bunky, Orovada, and Short Creek soils.  Bunky soils are moderately deep to strongly cemented duripans.  Orovada soils are coarse-loamy.  Short Creek soils are clayey-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium or high surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Clurde soils are used for irrigated hayland, rangeland, and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, littleleaf horsebrush, basin wildrye, and cheatgrass.  Many areas of this soil have been burned and seeded to crested wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Nevada and south-central Oregon.  These soils are moderately extensive.  The series concept and main acreage is in MLRA 24, while other acreage occurs in MLRA 23 in Oregon and MLRA 25 in Nevada.
