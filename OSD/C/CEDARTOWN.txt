MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Worcester County, Maryland, 1995 

REMARKS: This soil was formerly included in the Galestown soil series. The 01/2010 revision revises the type location description and changes the format to tabular and metric.

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 36 cm  (A and E horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 36 to 76 cm  (Bt horizon) as indicated by distinct clay bridging
Aquic conditions--the zone from 137 cm  to a depth of 203 cm is periodically saturated (endosaturation)
