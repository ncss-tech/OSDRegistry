CONTIDE SERIES

The Contide series very deep, well and moderately well drained soils that formed in loamy slope alluvium over clayey slope alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks.  Contide soils are on alluvial fans and valley sideslopes.  Slopes are 2 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 36 degrees F.

(4 to 24 inches thick)  

    Bt2--48 to 56 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) silty clay, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, firm; moderately plastic, moderately sticky; thin wax-like patches on ped faces and discontinuous wax-like coatings on the inside of root channels and pores; calcareous; moderately alkaline, pH 8.0 (cresol red); gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)  

    Bk--56 to 64 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; very hard, firm, moderately plastic, moderately sticky; visible secondary calcium carbonate occurring as concretions and in thin seams and streaks; calcareous; moderately alkaline, pH 8.2 (cresol red).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no current competitors in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loamy slope alluvium over clayey slope alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks
Landform: gently to steeply sloping alluvial fans or valley sideslopes
Slopes: 2 to 40 percent slopes
Elevation: 
Mean annual precipitation: about 18 inches at the type location with peak periods of precipitation occurring in the spring and early summer months
Mean annual air temperature:  about 36 degrees F.
Mean summer air temperature:  about 56 degrees F.
Frost-free period:  

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Asperson and Hub series.  The Asperson series differs in having bedrock above 40 inches and in having thinner solums.  The Hub series differs in having a moderately thick dark colored A1 horizon and in having thinner solums with the top of the B2t horizon above 24 inches.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well to moderately well drained.  Runoff is slow to rapid.  Permeability is moderate to slow.  

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used as native pastureland, recreation, and forestry.  Native vegetation includes aspen and conifers with a fair understory of brush and grass.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Present known distribution limited to central Wyoming.  The series is of limited extent.

SERIES PROPOSED:  Sage Creek Watershed area, 1971.  Series name is a coined name.  

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 32 to 52 inches.  (Bt2 and Bt3 horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 4 to 16 inches.  (A and E horizons)
Albic horizon:  The zone from 4 to 16 inches.  (E horizon)
Glossic horizon:  The zone from 16 to 32 inches.  (E/B horizons)
Argillic horizon:  The zone from 32 to 56 inches.  Bt horizons)

A paper revision and update of the series was made by MO6 August, 2000.  The classification was changed from Typic Cryoboralfs to Typic Palecryalfs.  Format and horizonation designations were updated. It was stated in the 1971 description that the argillic horizon started below 24 inches, hence the current Palecryalf classification.  However, if the mixed clay content of the E/B horizon is later determined to meet the minimum required clay increase for an argillic horizon, then the top of the argillic horizon would be the top of the E/B horizon.  If the argillic starts at the E/B then the particle-size class would probably be fine-loamy and mixed instead of fine and smectitic. The series has not been updated by the state since 1971.
