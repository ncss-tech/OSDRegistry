CINDERBUTTE SERIES

The Cinderbutte series consists of moderately deep to cinders, well drained soils that formed in loess and eolian sand overlying tephra.  Cinderbutte soils are on fissure vents and volcanic cones on lava fields. Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent. The mean annual temperature is 4 degrees C, and the mean annual precipitation is about 381 mm.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy over pumiceous or cindery, mixed, superactive Xeric Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:   Cinderbutte loam on a south-facing, convex, 3 percent slope, under shrubs at an elevation of 1963 meters. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.  When described on September 7, 2005, the soil was dry throughout)

	A1--0 to 5 cm; dark brown (10YR 3/3) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak thin platy structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and common fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.

	A2--5 to 18 cm; dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) loam, very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and common fine, medium, coarse and very coarse roots; many very fine and common fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of A horizons range from 5 to 18 cm)

	AB--18 to 33 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/2) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine, medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and common fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine and common fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (15 to 28 cm thick)

	Bw--33 to 54 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and common fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine and common fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary.  (15 to 22 cm thick)

	2BC--54 to 69 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 45 percent gravel sized cinders and 10 percent cobble sized cinders; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt wavy boundary.  (15 to 23 cm thick)

	2C--69 to 152 cm; fragmental material (50 percent gravel sized and 50 percent cobble sized cinders.)
