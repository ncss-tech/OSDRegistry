CRANELL SERIES

The Cranell series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils. These nearly level soils, on flats, formed in loamy and clayey sediments of mid-to late-Pleistocene age. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (70 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 89 cm (35 in).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Banquete, Calallen, Edroy, and Victoria series. 
Banquete series: do not have an argillic horizon and are on a lower landscape position.
Calallen series: have a fine-loamy argillic horizon and are on a similar to slightly higher landscape position. 
Edroy series: are clayey throughout and are in enclosed depressions.
Victoria series: are clayey throughout and are on a similar landscape position.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is slow.  Runoff is medium.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for crop production, wildlife habitat, livestock grazing, and forage production.  Corn, grain sorghum, and cotton are the principle crops.  Native vegetation includes bluestems, threeawns, gramas, and paspalums. Huisache and mesquite have encroached on many rangeland areas.  The ecological site is: Blackland, PE 31-44 (150A526TT)

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Gulf Coast Prairies (MLRA 150A in LRR T) of the Coastal Bend of southern Texas.  Series is of moderate extent.
