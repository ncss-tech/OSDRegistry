CHARCOAL SERIES

The Charcoal series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium or till. These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans, or moraines. Slopes are 0 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 500 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed Xeric Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Charcoal gravelly loam in rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

 A--0 to 8 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; common very fine and fine roots; many irregular pores; 30 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); abrupt smooth boundary. 

 Bw--8 to 31 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; many very fine and common fine, medium, and coarse roots; many irregular pores; 45 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear wavy boundary.  

 C1--31 to 59 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely gravelly coarse sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; common very fine and few fine roots; 60 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6); gradual wavy boundary.  

 C2--59 to 150 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) extremely gravelly coarse sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; 60 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6).
