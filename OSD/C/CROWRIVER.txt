CROWRIVER SERIES

The Crowriver series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in loamy till. These soils are on nearly level to slightly convex positions on moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 735 millimeters.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Grovecity, Lundlake, Swedegrove, and Uniongrove soils.
Grovecity--are on higher landscape positions and have a frequently saturated zone between depths 0.75 and 1.2 meters during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Lundlake--are on lower landscape positions in depressions and have a mollic epipedon greater than 60 centimeters thick

Uniongrove--are on slightly lower landscape positions on flats and swales and do not have carbonates in the upper third of the series control section

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class--poorly drained--in an undrained condition, a frequently saturated zone occurs at the surface of the soil to a depth of 0.3 meter during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--10.00 to 100.00 micrometers per second

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are artificially drained and cultivated. The principal corps are corn, soybeans, small grains, and legume hay. The native vegetation is predominantly wet-site tall prairie species such as prairie cordgrass, switchgrass, big bluestem, wooly sedge, giant goldenrod and Canada goldenrod.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

calcic horizon--the zone between a depth of 33 and 152 centimeters (ABk, Bkg1, Bkg2, and  Bkg3 horizons);
aquic moisture regime. 1/2011-TYPE LOCATION error was corrected.

Cation-exchange activity class is supported by lab data and from similar soils in the surrounding area.
