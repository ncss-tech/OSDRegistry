CZAR SERIES

The Czar series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvial and eolian sediments of Holocene age over loamy alluvium deposits of Quaternary age.  These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping stream terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 22.2 degrees C (72 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in).

Orelia soils: have a mollic epipedon less than 50 cm (20 in) thick and are on broad flat landforms in the Beaumont formation
Premont soils: have an ochric epipedon and are on slightly higher convex landforms
Delfina soils: have an ochric epipedon, masses of oxidized iron in the control section, and are on convex landforms

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is moderate.  Runoff is negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes and low on 1 to 3 percent slopes.  Some areas rarely flood during high rainfall events caused by tropical storms.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major uses are crop and forage production, livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The major crop grown is grain sorghum.  Improved pastures grasses are coastal bermudagrass and buffelgrass.  Native grasses are mainly two and four-flower trichloris, hooded windmill grass, Wrights threeawn, and plains bristlegrass.  Woody vegetation includes mesquite, spiny hackberry, huisache, and prickly pear.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Rio Grande Plain (MLRA 83A in LRR I) of southern Texas.  The series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Jim Wells County, Texas; 1976.

REMARKS:  This soil was previously included in the Willacy series.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon: 0 to 53 cm (0 to 21 in)
Argillic horizon: 36 to 203 cm (14 to 80 in)
Depth to secondary carbonates: 91 to 203 cm (36 to 80 in)
Lithologic discontinuity: The zone from 99 to 203 cm (39 to 80 in). (2Btk horizons).  Data shows the lithologic discontinuity is weakly expressed.  Very fine to fine sand ratio shows a decrease at 155 cm (61 in).  The presence of coarse spherical, moderately cemented, carbonate nodules indicate a deposition of alluvium with a different lithology than the recent alluvium in the upper part of the solum.
