COMBEST SERIES 

The Combest series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over colluvium derived from argillite and quartzite bedrock.  Combest soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 4 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Andic Haplustepts 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Combest gravelly ashy silt loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; undecomposed and slightly decomposed forest litter. 

    A--2 to 4 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly ashy silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; volcanic ash component; 20 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 3 inches thick) 

    Bw--4 to 12 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly ashy silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; 30 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (8 to 10 inches thick) 

    2E--12 to 26 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; 15 percent cobbles, 40 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual wavy boundary. (4 to 16 inches thick) 

    2E/Bw--26 to 60 inches; E part (80 percent) is light gray (10YR 7/2) extremely cobbly sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist that surrounds the B part (20 percent) is pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely cobbly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots; 30 percent cobbles, 40 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Combest soils are used for timber production, wildlife habitat, and watersheds.  Potential native vegetation is mainly Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine with an understory of white spirea, saskatoon serviceberry, elk sedge, and pinegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Combest soils are of small extent in western Montana. MLRA 43A.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1290.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the mineral soil surface to 7 inches (A, Bw horizons); an ash influenced layer from 2 to 12 inches (A, Bw horizons); an albic horizon from 12 to 26 inches (2E horizon); a cambic horizon from 12 to 60 inches (2E, 2E/Bw horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches below the mineral soil surface (2E, 2E/Bw horizons).  Combest soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
