CYCLOPIC SERIES

The Cyclopic series consists of moderately deep to a hardpan, well drained soils formed in alluvium from granite and basalt on fan terraces.  Slopes range from 3 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, thermic Typic Argidurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cyclopic very gravelly sandy loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 2 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; 40 percent gravel; 10 percent cobble; slightly effervescent, 3 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick)

    Bt1--2 to 5 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) extremely gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; few distinct clay films on ped faces and in pores; 50 percent gravel, 10 percent cobble, 10 percent stone; slightly effervescent, 3 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt2--5 to 16 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) extremely gravelly clay, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; strong fine prismatic parting to strong fine and medium angular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; many very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on ped faces and in pores; 50 percent gravel, 10 percent cobble, 10 percent stone; slightly effervescent, 4 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (6 to 14 inches thick)

    Btk--16 to 26 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) very stony clay, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common prominent clay films on ped faces and in pores; 30 percent gravel, 10 percent cobble, 10 percent stone; slightly effervescent, 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; few rounded calcium carbonate masses; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (8 to 16 inches thick)

    2Bkqm--26 to 60 inches; silica-lime cemented hardpan.

TYPE LOCATION:  Mohave County, Arizona; about 9 miles south-southeast of Meadview; 1,600 feet west, 2,200 feet south of the northeast corner section 19, T. 29 N., R. 16 W. Gila and Salt River Base Meridian.  Located at a latitude of 35 degrees, 53 minutes, 14 seconds North and longitude of 114 degrees, 02 minutes, 16 seconds West.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Lealandic (NV) series.  Lealandic soils have 10YR hue throughout and are dry in the soil moisture control section for longer periods due to a lower rainfall component.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cyclopic soils are on fan terraces at elevations of 3,200 to 4,200 feet.  Slopes range from 3 to 12 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium from granite and basalt.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 200 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Detrital, Meadview, Skelon and Yurm soils.  Detrital and Meadview soils are very deep.  Greyeagle and Yurm soils have a hardpan above 20 inches.  Skelon soils are loamy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation includes blackbrush, Nevada Mormon tea, Banana Yucca, flattop buckwheat, creosotebush and big galleta.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Arizona.  Cyclopic soils are of small extent.  MLRA is 30.
