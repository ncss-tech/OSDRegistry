COBBLETOP SERIES

The Cobbletop series consists of very deep moderately well or somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium (outwash).  These soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Oxyaquic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cobbletop fine sandy loam  on a northeast facing slope of 1 percent in irrigated hayland at an elevation of 7,315 feet.  (Colors are dry soil unless otherwise stated).  When described on 7/3/2003, the soil was moist from 0 to 14 inches.

    Ap--0 to 4 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 6 percent gravel; non-effervescent; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt--4 to 14 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) very gravelly sandy clay loam, very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable; slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine tubular pores; common discontinuous distinct very dark brown (10YR 2/2) clay films on faces of peds; 40 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; non-effervescent; common very fine and fine distinct strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) redox concentrations; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual smooth boundary.  (4 to 16 inches thick)

    Bk1--14 to 25 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) extremely cobbly sandy loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; single grain; loose, loose; few very fine and fine roots; few fine interstitial pores; 25 percent gravel, 35 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; carbonates are disseminated; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual smooth boundary.  (6 to 26 inches thick)
 
    Bk2--25 to 80 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) extremely cobbly loamy sand, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; single grain; loose, loose; few very fine and fine roots; few fine interstitial pores; 30 percent gravel, 40 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; carbonates are disseminated; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series currently recognized in this family.
These are the Bazoo and Fortsupply series. 
Bazoo and Fortsupply soils have fine-loamy control sections.
Fortsupply soils have accumulations of secondary calcium carbonate at depths of 8 to 22 inches.
 
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform:  (strath) stream terraces
Parent material:  alluvium
Elevation:  6,200 to 7,400 feet
Slope:  0 to 6 percent
Mean annual precipitation:  9 to 14 inches
Mean annual air temperature:  39 to 43 degrees F.
Frost-free period:  60 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Millburne, Robertson and Urie series.  Millburne and Robertson soils occur on similar positions as Cobbletop but have fine-loamy control sections and calcic horizons with petronodes at depths greater than 10 inches.  Urie soils have a calcic horizon with petronodes at depths greater than 10 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  moderately well or somewhat poorly drained due to flood irrigation.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and rapid in the lower part of the solum. Runoff is negligible to low.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally as irrigated hayland and pasture.  Principal vegetation includes garrison creeping foxtail, sedge, rush, big sage, Sandberg bluegrass and western wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Present known distribution limited to the southwestern part of Wyoming.  MLRA34A.  The series is of small extent.
