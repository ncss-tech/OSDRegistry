CARTECAY SERIES

The Cartecay series consists of somewhat poorly drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in thick loamy alluvial sediments. These soils have a dark brown loamy surface layer about 9 inches thick and brownish loamy stratified C horizons that are mottled with gray. Near the type location the mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 55 inches. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, semiactive, nonacid, thermic Aquic Udifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Cartecay loam--pasture. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

  Ap--0 to 9 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) loam; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many fine roots; many very fine mica flakes; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (7 to 12 inches thick) 

  C1--9 to 18 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam; common medium distinct dark brown (10YR 3/3) mottles; massive; very friable; many fine roots; many fine mica flakes; thin strata of silt loam and sandy loam; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. (6 to 10 inches thick) 

  C2--18 to 40 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam; massive; very friable; many fine mica flakes; thin strata of silt loam, loam, and loamy sand; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) masses of iron accumulation and light gray (10YR 7/2) iron depletions; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary. (18 to 24 inches thick) 

  Cg--40 to 60 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) stratified sand and loamy sand; single grain; loose; few gravel; many fine mica flakes; moderately acid. 

TYPE LOCATION: Pickens County, Georgia; 0.5 mile west of Talking Rock along Georgia State Highway 5, 1.25 miles west on graded road to Antioch Church, 0.5 mile southwest to ford of tributary of Talking Rock Creek; site is 30 feet west of road and 100 feet north of creek. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is slightly acid through strongly acid in the control section, but all pedons have pH of 5.5 or higher in some part. Thin strata of contrasting textures are throughout the soil. Clay content in the 10- to 40-inch control section ranges from 8 to 18 percent and there is more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand. Mica flakes are few to many in all horizons. 

The Ap horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6; or hue of 5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 4 or 6. Some pedons have a surface layer with hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 3 or 4 that is less than 6 inches thick. The A horizon is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, sandy clay loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent. 

The C horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 5YR, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 6. Iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less are within 20 inches of the surface. In some pedons these horizons are mottled in shades of brown, yellow, red, and gray. Texture is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or loamy sand with thin strata of coarser or finer material. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 15 percent. 

The Cg horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is mottled with colors in shades of gray, brown, and red. The Cg horizon is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam, silt loam, sand, or loamy sand, and the gravel content ranges from 0 to 50 percent. 

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. Those in closely related families are the Buncombe, Chewacla, Congaree, Enoree, Iuka, Riverview, and Toccoa series. Buncombe soils have sandy control sections. Chewacla, Congaree, and Riverview soils are fine-loamy. Enoree soils have dominant color with chroma less than 3. Iuka soils have siliceous mineralogy. Toccoa soils lack gray mottles within 20 inches of the soil surface. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cartecay soils are on nearly level flood plains in narrow valleys of streams in the Piedmont Plateau and adjoining MLRAs where streams flow from Piedmont. Slopes are mostly 0 to 2 percent but range from 0 to 5 percent. The soil formed in thick loamy alluvial sediments. The average annual precipitation is about 48 to 57 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 58 to 65 degrees F. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Buncombe, Chewacla, Congaree, Enoree, Riverview, and Toccoa series and Altavista, Augusta, and Wehadkee series. Altavista and Augusta soils are fine-loamy. Wehadkee soils are poorly drained and are fine-loamy. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; slow runoff; moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of the Cartecay soils are cleared and used for pastures of tall fescue, clover, and bermudagrass. Minor acreages are used for growing corn, small grain, vegetables, and hay. Native vegetation is mixed hardwood. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. The series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Pickens County, Georgia; 1969. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizon recognized in this pedon is: 
Ochric epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 9 inches (Ap horizon). 
Aquic conditions - periodic endosaturation and redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less within 20 inches of the mineral surface.
