CLINTON SERIES

The Clinton series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loess. These soils are on convex summits of interfluves, upper side slopes on uplands, and treads and risers on stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Ringgold County, Iowa, 1916

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 38 to 88 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 183 centimeters (A, E1, E2, E3, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, Bt5, and Bt6 horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 38 centimeters A, E1, E2, and E3 horizons);
albic horizon--the zone from a depth of 5 to 38 centimeters (E1, E2, and E3 horizons);
argillic horizon-- the zone from a depth of 38 to 183 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, Bt5, and Bt6 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Classification changed to Typic subgroup because the linear extensibility (LE) of 4.37 does not meet the requirements for Chromic Vertic subgroup.

In parts of MLRA 108 this soil meets the well drained drainage class criteria as defined in Soil Survey Manual.  Drainage class is a state interpretation.
