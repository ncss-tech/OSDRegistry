CRANBAY SERIES

The Cranbay series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on mountain slopes.  These soils formed in colluvium and alluvium derived dominantly from limestone.  Slopes are 10 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 36 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Inceptic Haplocryalfs

COMPETING SERIES:  The following soils are currently classified as Mollic Cryoboralfs. The will classify as Mollic or Inceptic Haplocryalfs based on the thickness of the argillic horizon. These are Amesmont (WY), Beardall (UT), Bramard (ID), Dunlatop (CO), Hub (T WY), Moosegrove (T ID), Nisula (ID), Rimton (WY), Stringam (ID), Swapps (UT), Telcher (ID), Ula (CO) and Wix (CO) soils.  Amesmont, Beardall, Rimton, Swapps, Ula, and Wix soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Bramard, Dunlatop, Hub, Moosegrove, Nisula, Stringam, and Telcher soils are noncalcareous throughout.  In addition, Bramard soils have umbric epipedons and are medium to very strongly acid, Dunlatop soils are medium or strongly acid, and Nisula soils have less than 5 percent rock fragment throughout.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cranbay soils are on mountain slopes. They are formed in colluvium and alluvium from sedimentary rocks, dominantly limestone from the Wasatch formation.  Slopes range from 10 to 50 percent.  Elevation is 8,400 to 10,300 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 22 to 30 inches. The average annual air temperature is 34 to 40 degrees F. The frost-free season is 40 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Winnemucca and Faim series.  Winnemucca and Faim soils contain more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland.  Native vegetation is mainly Douglas-fir, white fir, ponderosa pine, manzanila and some scattered aspen.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Utah.  This series is not extensive.  MLRA 47.
