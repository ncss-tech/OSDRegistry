CORTYZACK SERIES

The Cortyzack series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in eolian deposits and slope alluvium derived from sandstone.  Cortyzack soils are on hills.  Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcidic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cortyzack fine sandy loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 2 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) fine sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)

(15 to 25 inches thick)

    Bk2--45 to 60 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) sandy clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, sticky and slightly plastic; 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; common fine filaments of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cortyzack soils are on hills.  The soils formed in eolian deposits and slope alluvium derived from sandstone.  Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent.  Elevation ranges from 6,800 to 8,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 20 inches and is evenly distributed throughout the year.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 70 to 95 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Detra and Emlin soils.  The Detra soils lack a calcic horizon and have mollic epipedons that are more than 16 inches thick.  The Emlin soils have hues of 10YR or yellower in the mollic epipedon and in the argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very low to medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation consists of needleandthread, western wheatgrass, muttongrass, prairie junegrass, Wyoming big sagebrush, and mountain snowberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  These soils occur in northwestern Colorado and northeastern Utah.  LRR E, MLRA 47 and 48A.  The series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Moffat County (Moffat County Area), Colorado, 1991.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 9 inches.  (A1 and A2 horizons)
Argillic horizon:  The zone from 9 to 24 inches.  (Bt and Btk horizons)
Calcic horizon:  The zone from 24 to 45 inches.  (Bk1 horizons)

These soils have an aridic ustic soil moisture regime.  The color range for the dry values in the top 6 inches is 3 to 5, which overlaps with Aridic Argiborolls and Typic Argiborolls.  This pedon has color values dry of 4 in the top 6 inches and thus is classified as a Typic Argiboroll.  

The classification was changed from Typic Argiborolls to frigid Calcidic Argiustolls 12/98.
