COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Macks Camp, Shark Valley, and Tamiami soils. 
Macks Camp soils have limestone bedrock at depths of 100 to 150 centimeters (40 to 60 inches) and occur on similar landform positions. 
Shark Valley soils have limestone bedrock at depths of 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) and occur on similar landform positions.
Tamiami soils have limestone bedrock at depths of 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches), are stratified with calcareous silty marl sediments, and occur on similar landform positions.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landscape: Florida Everglades and Lower Coastal Plain
Landform: Talfs, rises, and/or dips in fresh water marshes and swamps of the Everglades and depressions on flatwoods areas.  
Parent Material: organic materials formed from remains of hydrophytic herbaceous plant overlying limestone bedrock. 
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 25 to 27 degrees C. (77 to 81 degrees F.)
Mean Annual Precipitation: 1118 to 1651 millimeters (44 to 65 inches)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Buffalo Tiger soils have limestone bedrock at depths of 150 centimeters or more (60 inches) and occur on similar landform positions.
Gator Lake soils have limestone bedrock within 5 to 18 centimeters (2 to 7 inches) of the surface and occur in similar landform positions.
Loxahatche soils are very deep, lack limestone substratum within 203 centimeters (80 inches) and are in similar landform positions.
Plantation soils have sandy layers more than 25 centimeters (10 inches) thick below the organic layer and have limestone bedrock at depths of 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches).

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class: Very poorly drained.
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (KSAT): Moderately high to very high in the organic material and negligible in the rock material
Surface Runoff: Negligible.
Flooding frequency and duration: Sawgrass plains are very frequently flooded for very long periods, during the dry season or in drought conditions these soils may not be flooded. In natural conditions, flooding occurs for very long duration of 9 to 11 months. Tree Islands are occasionally flooded for brief periods during periods of heavy rainfall, severe storms, and hurricanes. Currently flooding is controlled by anthropogenic activities.
Ponding frequency and duration: depressions on flatwoods areas are covered by water (ponded) very frequently for very long duration 9 to 11 months.

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses: Water quality, water storage, and wildlife habitat. 
Dominant Vegetation: Sawgrass, sedges, lilies, spikerush, willow, elderberry, pond apple, and cypress. 

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Florida Everglades and associated areas.
