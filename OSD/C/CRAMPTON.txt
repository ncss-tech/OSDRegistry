CRAMPTON SERIES 

The Crampton series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to grus and deep to hard granite.  These soils formed in slope alluvium, colluviums, and residuum from hard fine and coarse grained igneous rocks deposited over coarse grained granitic bedrock.  They are on escarpments, ridges and hills.  Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls
