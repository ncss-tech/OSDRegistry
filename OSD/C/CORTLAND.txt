CORTLAND SERIES

The Cortland series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy till. Cortland soils are on uplands. Slopes range from 2 to 18 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 81 centimeters, and the mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Mollic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Cortland loam - in cropland.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 15 centimeters; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) dry; weak fine granular structure; very friable; common fine roots throughout; common fine tubular pores; 1 percent by volume pebbles; very strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (8 to 23 centimeters thick)

 Bt1--15 to 38 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 4/3) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common very fine and fine roots throughout; common fine tubular pores; faint patchy clay films on faces of peds and distinct discontinuous pressure faces on vertical and horizontal faces of peds and dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) organic coats in root channels and pores; 2 percent by volume pebbles; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.

 Bt2--38 to 71 centimeters; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) dry; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; friable; common very fine and fine roots throughout; common fine tubular pores; prominent discontinuous clay films on vertical and horizontal faces of peds and prominent continuous pressure faces on vertical and horizontal faces of peds and dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) organic coats in root channels and pores; 2 percent by volume pebbles; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the Bt horizons ranges from 25 to 76 centimeters.)

 BC--71 to 91 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 4/3) sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; common very fine and fine roots throughout; common very fine tubular pores; 3 percent by volume pebbles; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. (10 to 51 centimeters thick)

 2C1--91 to 102 centimeters; brown (10YR 4/3) loamy sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; massive; loose; few very fine and fine roots throughout; common very fine tubular pores; 3 percent by volume pebbles; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.

 2C2--102 to 127 centimeters; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) loamy sand, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) dry; massive; loose; few very fine and fine roots throughout; common very fine tubular pores; 6 percent by volume pebbles; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.

 2C3--127 to 200 centimeters; brown (10YR 5/3) loamy sand, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) dry; massive; loose; common very fine tubular pores; 2 percent by volume pebbles; slightly acid.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Angus, Argyle, Gara, Koronis, Lester,Newcomer, Sebbo, Taopi and Waucoma in the same family.
Angus, Gara, Koronis, Lester soils have carbonates within the series control section.
Argyle soils have a lithological discontinuity within the upper 51 centimeters of the series control section. 
Newcomer soils have a paralithic contact between 51 and 102 centimeters.
Sebbo soils have a perched seasonal water table at 107 to 183 centimeters.
Taopi and Waucoma soils have a lithic contact between 102 and 152 centimeters.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: Loamy till.
Landform: Narrow interfluves and convex side slopes on uplands
Slopes: 2 to 18 percent
Elevation: 360 to 439 meters
Mean annual air temperature: 10 to 12 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation: 71 to 97 centimeters
Frost-free period: 160 to 190 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Morrill, Malmo, Wymore, and Nodaway soils.
Morrill soils have a mollic epipedon and are on similar landform positions as Cortland soils.
Malmo soils are fine textured and are on similar landform positions as Cortland soils.
Wymore soils are on somewhat higher landform positions, formed in loess and are fine textured.
Nodaway soils formed in alluvium and are in narrow upland drains.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage: Well
Runoff: Low or medium
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: Moderately high

USE AND VEGETATION: The less sloping areas usually are cultivated.  The principal crops are corn, grain sorghum, and winter wheat.  The more strongly sloping areas have been reseeded to pasture or range. Native vegetation is tall prairie grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern Kansas and southeastern Nebraska. LRR M, MLRA 106. The soils of this series are of limited extent, about 10,000 acres.
