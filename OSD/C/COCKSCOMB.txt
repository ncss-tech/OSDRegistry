COCKSCOMB SERIES

The Cockscomb series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in basaltic alluvium overlying older mixed alluvium.  Cockscomb soils are on mesas and hills and have slopes of 3 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, thermic Calcidic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cockscomb very gravelly loam - woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 1 inch; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) very gravelly sandy clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine angular blocky parting to moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine roots, common fine tubular pores; 50 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 2 inches thick)

    A2--1 to 3 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) gravelly sandy clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; weak thin platy parting to strong very fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, sticky and plastic; many very fine, common fine and few medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 5 inches thick)

    Btk1--3 to 13 inches; red (2.5YR 4/6) gravelly clay, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky parting to strong medium angular blocky structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; many medium, common fine and few coarse roots; common fine tubular pores; 5 percent cobble and 15 percent gravel; common faint coats of calcium carbonate on undersides of rock fragments; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (9 to 12 inches thick)

    Btk2--13 to 22 inches; red (2.5YR 4/6) gravelly clay, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; strong fine and medium angular blocky structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common medium and coarse roots; few fine tubular pores; 5 percent cobble and 20 percent gravel; common faint clay films on faces of peds; common strongly cemented calcium carbonate lenses; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt irregular boundary.  (8 to 11 inches thick)

    2Bk1--22 to 26 inches; pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) gravelly sandy loam, reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common medium roots; few fine tubular pores; 25 percent gravel; common, discontinuous, strongly calcium carbonate cemented lenses; violently effervescent, 20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (3 to 5 inches thick)

    2Bk2--26 to 60 inches; variegated pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) and reddish yellow (7.5YR 8/6) very gravelly sandy loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) and reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) moist; massive and single grain; hard and loose, firm and loose; nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and medium roots; few very fine irregular pores; 5 percent cobble, 40 percent gravel as mostly saprolitic sandstone and basalt; many thin weakly calcium carbonate cemented lamina between sandy loam layers; violently effervescent, 20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cockscomb soils are on mesas and hills at elevations of 4,200 to 4,800 feet.  Slopes range from 3 to 40 percent.  These soils formed in basaltic alluvium overlying older mixed alluvium.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 60 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 220 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Turist and Sedona soils.   Sedona soils are shallow to paralithic contact and the Turist soils are very shallow to a lithic contact.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for grazeable woodland, wildlife habitat and urban land.  Present vegetation includes one seed juniper, canotia, prickly pear, wait-a-minute acacia, threeawn, beargrass and pinyon pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Arizona.  Cockscomb soils are of very limited extent.  MLRA is 38.  The name is derived from Cockscomb Rock near Sedona.
