CHAZNER SERIES

The Chazner series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to an indurated calcium carbonate hardpan. They formed in alluvium derived from quartz diorite and sandstone on treads of fan terraces.  Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chazner soils are on treads of fan terraces.  They formed in alluvium derived from calcareous Tertiary quartz diorite and Jurassic sandstone.  Slopes range from 5 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 6,200 to 7,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches with about half falling as winter snow and half falling as rain from high intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Katzine, Tsezhin, and Wetherill soils.  Katzine soils are loamy-skeletal, very deep, and occur on adjacent risers of fan terraces.  Tsezhin soils are loamy-skeletal, very deep, and occur on younger surfaces.  Wetherill soils are fine-silty, very deep, and occur on eolian mantled surfaces.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Chazner soils are used for livestock grazing and fuelwood production.  Present vegetation is Utah juniper, pinyon, Wyoming big sagebrush, black sagebrush, datil yucca, green Mormon-tea, muttongrass, and blue grama.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Chazner soils are of small extent on the Red Rock Bench portion-Canyonlands Section of the Colorado Plateau province in northeast Arizona and northwest New Mexico.  LRR-D; MLRA 35.
