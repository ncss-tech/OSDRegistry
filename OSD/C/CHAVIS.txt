GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent Material: Human-transported material over residuum
Landform: Fills, raised land, or other locally raised landforms on slopes and ridges
Slope: 10 to 15 percent
Elevation: 40 to 110 meters 
Frost-free period: 200 to 250 days
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 13 to 17 degrees C
Mean Annual Precipitation: 1000 to 1200 millimeters

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Appling, Beltline, Cecil, Pacolet, Walcreek, and Wedowee soils. 

Appling soils have 35 to 60 precent clay in the particle-size control section; have few to many mica flakes throughout; found on nearby unmodified ridges and sideslopes
Beltline soils have less than 50 centimeters of human-transported material; found on nearby cut and filled ridges and sideslopes 
Cecil soils have 35 to 60 precent clay in the particle-size control section and are dominantly 5YR or redder in the argillic horizons; found on nearby unmodified ridges and sideslopes
Pacolet soils have 35 to 60 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have few to common mica flakes in the argillic; found on nearby unmodified ridges and sideslopes.
Walcreek soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section; formed in human-transported fill from alluvium on nearby toeslopes
Wedowee soils have 35 to 60 precent clay in the particle-size control section; found on nearby unmodified ridges and sideslopes 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage Class: Well drained 
Surface Runoff: Low
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity Class: Moderately high except where compacted
Flooding: None
Ponding: None

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major uses uses for residential, commercial, and recreational applications in an urban setting. Vegetation may include a mix of managed and unmanaged plant communities with a mix of native and non-native species. Many areas are vegetated with non-native ornamental landscaping and/or turfgrass associated with developed land uses. Some areas may exhibit weedy, invasive, and/or primary succession vegetation communities (e.g., abandoned lots and other unmanaged areas). Some small patches of mixed native forest species such sweetgum, yellow poplar, shagbark hickory, American beech, and loblolly pine may be present.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Urban and other areas with human-modified landscapes in the South Atlantic and Gulf Slope Cash Crops, Forest, and Livestock Region
MLRA 136. These soils are of small extent.
