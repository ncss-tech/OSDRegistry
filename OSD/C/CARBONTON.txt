CARBONTON SERIES

The Carbonton series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils with slow permeability. They formed in residuum from Triassic siltstone, mudstone, conglomerate, and shale. These soils are on uplands of the Triassic Basin in the Southern Piedmont. Slope ranges from 2 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 47 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F. near the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, semiactive, thermic Oxyaquic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Carbonton silt loam--on a 2 percent slope in a mixed hardwood and pine forest. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

  A--0 to 8 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) silt loam; moderate medium granular structure; friable; many very fine and fine roots; 5 percent fine and medium siltstone pebbles; very strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 8 inches thick)

  BE--8 to 12 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) silt loam; moderate medium granular structure; friable, slightly sticky, non plastic; common fine roots; extremely acid; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick)

  Bt--12 to 28 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) silty clay; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm, moderately sticky, slightly plastic; common fine roots; common prominent clay films on faces of peds; extremely acid; gradual smooth boundary. (8 to 30 inches thick)

  BCt--28 to 34 inches; reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) silty clay loam; weak medium subangular blocky; friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few fine roots; 10 percent medium and coarse siltstone pebbles; few faint clay films on faces of peds; extremely acid; clear wavy boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick)

  Cr--34 to 62 inches; weathered reddish brown (2.5YR 5/4) moderately fractured Triassic siltstone.

TYPE LOCATION: Chatham County, North Carolina; about 2.8 miles east and 
southeast of Goldston on Secondary Road 2135 and 50 feet east of Secondary Road 2135, in woods; Goldston, North Carolina USGS topographic quadrangle; lat. 35 degrees 34 minutes 30 seconds N. and 79 degrees 17 minutes 16 seconds W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to paralithic contact with weathered bedrock (Cr) ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to a lithic contact with unweathered bedrock (R) is 40 to more than 60 inches. Rock fragments are less than 35 percent by volume in the A or Ap horizon, less than 15 percent by volume in the E, BE, Bt, and BCt horizons, and less than 35 percent by volume in the C horizon. Exchangeable aluminum is high (greater than 10 meq/100g). Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid except where surface layers have been limed.

The A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam and where eroded, silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.

The E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam.

The BE horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8. It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam and where eroded, silty clay loam or clay loam.

The Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8. Some subhorizons may have a value of 3. Iron accumulations in shades of red, yellow, or brown and iron depletions in shades of gray, yellow, or brown may occur in the lower part of the Bt horizon of some pedons. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay, or clay loam. The particle size control section averages more than 30 percent silt or more than 40 percent silt plus very fine sand.

The BCt horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8. Iron accumulations in shades of red, yellow, or brown and iron depletions in shades of gray, yellow, or brown may occur in some pedons. Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, loam, or silt loam.

The C horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8. Some pedons may contain mottles in shades of yellow or brown. Texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam saprolite in the fine-earth fraction.

The Cr horizon is weathered, highly fractured, Triassic siltstone, mudstone, conglomerate, or shale. 

The R horizon, where present, is unweathered Triassic siltstone, mudstone, conglomerate, or shale.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Brickhaven and Capshaw series in the same family. Brickhaven soils have Cr horizons within 40 to 60 inches of the surface. Capshaw soils have a solum thickness ranging from 40 to 60 inches, formed in old clayey alluvium and lack the high aluminum concentrations.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Carbonton soils are gently sloping to moderately steep and are on ridges and hill slopes in the Triassic Basins of the thermic Southern Piedmont. Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent. These soils formed in residuum weathered from Triassic siltstone, mudstone, conglomerate, or shale. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 57 to 65 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 41 to 53 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Brickhaven series in the same family and the Creedmoor, Green Level, Hallison, Mayodan, Mooshaunee, Peakin (T), Pinoka, Polkton, and White Store series. The well drained to moderately well drained Hallison soils are fine-silty, deep to Cr, and are in slight depressions, adjacent to drainageways, or at the heads of drains. The moderately well drained Mooshaunee soils are fine-silty and are in slight depressions, adjacent to drainageways, or at the heads of drains. The well drained Peakin soils are very deep and are on ridges and sideslopes. The well 
drained Pinoka soils are fine-loamy and are on ridges and shoulder slopes. The well drained Mayodan and moderately well and somewhat poorly drained Creedmoor soils do not have a Cr horizon within 60 inches and are on ridges and hill slopes. The moderately well drained Polkton and White Store soils and the somewhat poorly drained Green Level soils have a very high shrink-swell potential and are on ridges and hill slopes. In addition, White Store soils are deep to a Cr horizon and Green Level soils are very deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; medium to rapid runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of this soil is in woodland with some small areas in pasture. Forested areas are loblolly pine, shortleaf pine, southern red oak, white oak, and hickory. Understory species are dominantly red maple, sweet gum, eastern red cedar, flowering dogwood, and sourwood.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Triassic Basins of the thermic Southern 
Piedmont of North Carolina and possibly South Carolina and Virginia. The series has small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Anson County, North Carolina; 1999. The name is from the community of Carbonton in Chatham County.

REMARKS: This series was formerly included with the Pinoka series. Pinoka soils are fine-loamy. This soil is seldom used as cropland due to high aluminum concentrations and very low natural fertility.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 12 inches (A and EB horizons).
Argillic horizon - the zone from 12 to 34 inches below the surface (Bt and BCt horizons).
Paralithic contact - the occurrence of weathered bedrock at a depth of 34 inches (upper boundary of the Cr horizon).

SIR = NC0162 MLRA = 136
