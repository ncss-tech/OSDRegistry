CERRO SERIES

The Cerro series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, outwash or slide deposits. Cerro soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, outwash fans, landslides, mountain slopes and stream terraces. Slopes are from 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 457 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Vertic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Cerro clay loam in grassland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 18 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 10 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (13 to 25 cm thick)

    Bt1--18 to 28 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and fine angular blocky; moderate cracks between peds when dry; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few faint clay films on faces of peds and on surfaces along root channels; 10 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 15 cm thick)

    Bt2--28 to 66 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/2) clay, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium angular blocky; wedge shaped aggregates with wide cracks between peds when dry; extremely hard, very firm, sticky and plastic; few distinct clay films on faces of peds and on surfaces along root channels and pores; 10 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (13 to 104 cm thick)

    Bk--66 to 76 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak coarse and medium angular blocky structure; wide cracks between peds when dry; extremely hard, very firm, sticky and plastic; distinct carbonate coats on rock fragments; threadlike calcium carbonate masses in the matrix; strongly effervescent; 10 percent stones; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth boundary. (8 to 25 cm thick)

    BCk--76 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) stony clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; irregular cracks develop when dry; extremely hard, very firm, sticky and plastic; distinct carbonate coats on rock fragments; threadlike calcium carbonate masses in the matrix; 20 percent stones; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).
