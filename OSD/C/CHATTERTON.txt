CHATTERTON SERIES

The Chatterton series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in sandy alluvium. Chatterton soils are on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.6 degrees C (51 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Fluventic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Chatterton loamy sand, on a 1 percent slope in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 20 cm (8 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loamy sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; very friable; common very fine roots; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.

 A--20 to 30 cm (8 to 12 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loamy sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak medium granular; very friable; few very fine roots; neutral; clear wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the A horizon is 25 to 36 cm (10 to 14 inches).]

 Bw1--30 to 46 cm (12 to 18 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) loamy sand; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; very friable; thin continuous dark brown (10YR 3/3) organic coatings on faces of peds; common very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) root and worm channels; neutral; clear wavy boundary.

 Bw2--46 to 61 cm (18 to 24 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) loamy sand with thin strata of very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) sandy loam and silt loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; very friable; thin discontinuous dark brown (10YR 3/3) organic coatings on faces of peds; common very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) fillings in root and worm channels; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

 Bw3--61 to 81 cm (24 to 32 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) loamy sand; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; very friable; thin dark brown (10YR 3/3) organic coatings on sand grains; few very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) fillings in root and worm channels; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bw horizon is 25 to 66 cm (10 to 26 inches).]

 C1--81 to 112 cm (32 to 44 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) sand with thin strata of brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam and loam; single grain; loose; 2 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.

 C2--112 to 152 cm (44 to 60 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sand with thin strata of brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam and loam; single grain; loose; 3 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Warren County, Indiana; about 1 1/2 miles southwest of West Lebanon; 1660 feet west and 430 feet north of the center of sec. 23, T. 21 N., R. 9 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Thickness of the solum: 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches)
Depth to carbonates: 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches)

Ap, A horizons:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 3
Chroma: 1 to 3
Texture: loamy sand or fine sandy loam
Rock fragment content: 0 to 3 percent gravel
Reaction: moderately acid to neutral

Bw horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 3 to 5
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: loamy fine sand or loamy sand; thin strata ranging from sandy loam to silt loam are in all pedons and have a cumulative thickness of less than 8 cm (3 inches) to a depth of 102 cm (40 inches)
Rock fragment content: 0 to 3 percent gravel
Reaction: moderately acid to neutral in the upper part and slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline in the lower part

C horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 5 or 6
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: sand
Rock fragment content: 0 to 5 percent gravel
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Ouiatenon series. Ouiatenon soils have carbonates within a depth of 51 cm (20 inches) and average more than 5 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chatterton soils are on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Chatterton soils formed in sandy alluvium. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 965 mm (35 to 38 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.0 to 11.1 degrees C (50 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Landes, Moundhaven, and Stonelick soils on similar landscape positions. The well drained Landes soils contain more clay in the control section. The somewhat excessively drained Moundhaven soils do not have a mollic epipedon. The well drained Stonelick soils have more clay in the solum and do not have a mollic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high. Permeability is rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cropped to corn and soybeans. Some areas are used for woodland, hay, or pasture. Native vegetation is deciduous woodland with scattered prairie grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 110 and 111D in west-central Indiana. The type location is in MLRA 110. The series is of small extent.
