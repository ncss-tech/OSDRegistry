CAPTOM SERIES

The Captom series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone on backslopes of high plateaus, mesas, and structural benches. Permeability is rapid in the epipedon and moderate in the subsoil.  Slopes are 35 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competitors.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Captom soils are on backslopes of high plateaus, mesas, and structural benches.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from Tertiary sandstone.  Slopes range from 35 to 60 percent.  Elevation ranges from 8,500 to 9,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 22 inches with more than 50 percent falling as snow from winter storms.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 42 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Akhoni, Berland, Bikeyah, Klizhin and Retaw soils.  Akhoni soils are shallow to sandstone and occur on adjacent broad summits.  Berland soils are very shallow to sandstone and occur on non-wooded knolls and benches.  Bikeyah soils lack argillic horizons, are non-wooded and occur on toeslopes.  Klizhin soils lack argillic horizons and occur on footslopes below Captom soils.  Retaw soils are very poorly drained and have standing water on the surface.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; rapid runoff; rapid permeability in the epipedon and moderate in the subsoil.

USE AND VEGETATION: Captom soils are used for timber production and limited livestock grazing. Present vegetation is ponderosa pine with an understory of Gambel oak, Kentucky bluegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, earth sedge and Oregon grape.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Captom soils are of small extent on the Defiance Upwarp-Chuska Mountains portion of the Colorado Plateau Province in northwest New Mexico and northeast Arizona.  LRR-D; MLRA 39.
