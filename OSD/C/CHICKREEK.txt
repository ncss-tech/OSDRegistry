CHICKREEK SERIES

The Chickreek series consists of moderately deep to sand and gravel, poorly drained soils formed in diatomaceous earth and silty alluvium over sandy and gravelly alluvium on flood plains, outwash plains, and in low lying basins. Permeability is slow in the surface and upper substratum layers and very rapid in the lower layers. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Average annual precipitation is 30 inches and average annual temperature is 37 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, nonacid Typic Cryaquents

TYPICAL PEDON: Chickreek mucky peat - on a northwest, 1 percent slope at 6,290 feet elevation. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated. When described on July 7, 1979, this soil was moist to 21 inches and saturated below.)

    Oi--0 to 4 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) slightly decomposed fibric material; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) rubbed; about 80 percent fiber, 65 percent rubbed; massive; herbaceous fiber; about 5 percent mineral material; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 6 inches thick)

    Oa--4 to 7 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) highly decomposed sapric material, black (10YR 2/1) rubbed; about 25 percent fiber, 10 percent rubbed; massive; about 70 percent mineral matter; slightly acid (pH 6.5); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 3 inches thick)

    Ag--7 to 14 inches; light gray (10YR 6/1) silty clay loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; moderate thick and very thick platy structure parting to moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 13 inches thick)

    Cg1--14 to 22 inches; white (5Y 8/1) silty clay loam, gray (10YR 5/1) moist; moderate thick and very thick platy structure parting to moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. 

    Cg2--22 to 31 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 8/2) silty clay loam, light grayish brown (2.5Y 6/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; neutral (pH 7.0) clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Cg horizon is 9 to 27 inches)

    2C3--31 to 34 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; neutral (pH 6.8) clear smooth boundary. (0 to 3 inches thick)

    3C4--34 to 54 inches; multicolored sand; single grain; loose; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual smooth boundary. (5 to 20 inches thick)

    3C5--54 to 67 inches; multicolored extremely gravelly sand; single grain; loose; neutral (pH 7.2).

TYPE LOCATION: Fremont County, Idaho; about 2 miles east of the Island Park Ranger Station; 1,440 feet north and 2,640 feet east of the southwest corner, sec. 25, T.13N., R.43E.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. The similar Eyak and Reedy soils do not have a contrasting texture control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chickreek soils are on nearly level flood plains, outwash plains, and depressional areas on the lower part of alluvial fans. Slope range from 0 to 1 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,700 to 7,200 feet. The soil formed in mixed silty alluvium and diatomaceous earth that overlies sandy and gravelly alluvium. The average annual precipitation is about 20 to 35 inches, mostly occurring as snowfall. The average annual air temperature is about 36 to 40 degrees F. The frost-free season is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Bootjack series. Bootjack soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and are on low terraces and flood plains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained; very slow runoff; slow permeability in the upper part and very rapid below. Ponding from spring runoff occurs each year from April to June.

USE AND VEGETATION: Chickreek soils are used principally as rangeland. The potential natural vegetation is mainly timothy, sedges, and common camas on marshy areas and on areas not remaining ponded for as long a period, lodgepole pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Chickreek soils are of small extent in eastern Idaho.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Fremont County, Idaho, 1989.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Organic surface - the zone from the surface to a depth of 7 inches (the Oi and Oa horizons)

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 7 to 14 inches (the Ag horizon)

Diatomaceous earth - dominates the 7 to 31 inch depth.

Particle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of the Ag, the Cg1, Cg2, 2C3, and part of the 3C4 horizons)

Moisture regime - aquic
