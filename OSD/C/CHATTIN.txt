CHATTIN SERIES

The Chattin series consists of very deep, well drained soils with moderately slow permeability that formed in silty alluvium from loess and weathered volcanic ash over loamy alluvium from basalt and volcanic ash. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent on plains. The average annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the average annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Calciargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Chattin silt loam -- on a nearly level lava flow trough at 2,830 feet elevation in rangeland.  When described on June 10, 1999, the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

(1 to 3 inches thick)

(5 to 20 inches thick)

	2Btk1--17 to 23 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine and fine, few course tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and in pores; violently effervescent (about 25 percent CaC03); many large irregular shaped soft lime masses; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. 

	2Btk2--23 to 30 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silty clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine and fine, few medium tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; violently effervescent (about 30 percent CaC03); many large irregular shaped soft lime masses; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); clear smooth boundary. (combined Btkb horizon - 10 to 20 inches thick)

	3C--30 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; about 5 percent gravel; violently effervescent (about 20 percent CaC03); calcium carbonate is disseminated throughout the peds; moderately saline (EC 8); slightly alkaline (pH 7.4).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cataract, Grieta, Mack, Mesa, Neiber, Nannyton and Saddle series.  The Cataract, Neiber and Saddle soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to lithic or paralithic contact and lack buried argillic horizons.  The Grieta and Mack soils have textures in the argillic horizons that have greater than 35 percent fine sand or coarser and lack buried argillic horizons.  Mesa soils have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the Bk and C horizons and lack buried argillic horizons.  Nannyton soils have sandy or sandy-skeletal textures above 40 inches and lack buried argillic horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chattin soils are on lava flow troughs on shield volcanoes of plains. Elevation is 2,800 to 3,000 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  These soils formed in silty alluvium from loess and weathered volcanic ash over loamy alluvium from basalt and volcanic ash. Average annual precipitation is 6 to 7 inches. Average annual temperature is 53 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Tadpole (T) and Strike (T) soils. Tadpole and Strike soils have Bkq horizons with durinodes and lack fine-loamy argillic horizons. Landscape positions are similar.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; very slow to slow runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Chattin soils are used mainly for rangeland.  Natural vegetation is shadscale, bud sagebrush, Thurber needlegrass and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Ada and Elmore counties, Idaho; MLRA 11.  These soils are of limited extent.
