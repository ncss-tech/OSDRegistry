REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features in this pedon

*Aquic feature--zone from 28 to 150 cm

6/2008--The type location was moved to present location to better reflect the modal concept.

6/2016--This official series description (OSD) was updated as part of the final correlation of the Spokane County, Washington, soil survey. The ash in the Cocolalla soils is from the eruption of Mount Mazama. The content of ash is very high, but because of the sustained water table it has not weathered enough to meet the acid oxalate Al plus one-half Fe criteria for andic soil properties. Diatomaceous earth may be in some pedons. The formatting of the OSD was updated according to SSR1 Technical Note 11--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015).
