Landscape: Lower Coastal Plain
Landform(s): marine marshes, swamps, or low broad coastal flats in the tidal zone on the Key West Islands and/or along the southern coast of the Florida Peninsula
Parent material: Calcareous silty coastal marl materials over oolitic limestone bedrock
Slope: 0 to 1 percent
Elevation: -0.3 to 1.0 meters (-1.0 to 3 feet)
Mean annual temperature: 23 to 27 degrees C (73 to 81 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 940 to 1570 millimeters (37 to 62 inches)

Islamorada, Keylargo, and Tavernier soils: have control sections that contain highly decomposed organic material, occur in the tidal zone with mangroves, and occur on lower landform positions.
Keyvaca soils: have greater than 35 percent rock fragments throughout, have bedrock at depths less than 25 centimeters (10 inches), are better drained, and occur on higher landform positions.
Keywest soils: are stratified with sapric organic material and calcareous silty marl materials, occur in the tidal zone with mangroves, and occur on lower landform postions.
Lignumvitae soils have bedrock from 50 to less than 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches), occur in the tidal zone with mangroves and are subject to very frequent flooding.
