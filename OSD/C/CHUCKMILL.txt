CHUCKMILL SERIES

The Chuckmill series consists of shallow over a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff. Chuckmill soils occur on fan remnants. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is 9 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Vitrixerandic Argidurids 

TYPICAL PEDON: Chuckmill gravelly ashy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is partially covered with 30 percent gravel. Lithology of the rock fragments is welded tuff.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Bartome series.  Bartome soils have a duripan at 36 to 50 cm and have 0 to 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chuckmill soils are on fan remnants. These soils formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Elevations are 1,720 to 2,170 meters. The mean annual temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 200 to 250 mm. The frost-free season ranges from 90 to 130 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: There are the Lojet, Qwynn, and Sevenmile series. Lojet soils are moderately deep to a duripan. Qwynn and Sevenmile soils do not have a duripan. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; slow or medium runoff; moderately rapid saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Chuckmill soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The potential native vegetation includes Indian ricegrass, needleandthread, galleta, black sagebrush, fourwing saltbush and winterfat. This pedon is correlated to Ecological Site R028AY013NV Shallow Calcareous Loam 8-10 P.Z. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: East-central Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28A.
