CHELSEA SERIES

The Chelsea series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils formed in eolian sand. These soils are on convex summits of interfluves, side slopes, and crests of escarpments, commonly along the eastern side of stream valleys. These soils also occur on dunes on valley trains along the major rivers containing sandy outwash. Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 890 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, mesic Lamellic Udipsamments

TYPICAL PEDON: Chelsea loamy fine sand, on a convex slope of about 7 percent, in a wooded area, at an elevation of about 321 meters above sea level.
