COMPETING SERIES: These are the Goldenorth, Ricepeak, and Tseenjik soils.
Goldenorth soils are very poorly drained, have a loess cap over gravely till, and occur on hillslopes in valleys.
Ricepeak soils have alluvium parent material and occur on flats and till plains.
Tseenjik soils lack a mollic epipedon and occur on floodplains.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Elevation: 200 to 600 meters (655 to 1970 ft)
Parent material: organic material over silty loess
Landform: hillslopes and hills
Slopes: 0 to 10 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 300 to 800 mm (12 to 31 in)
Mean annual air temperature: -4 to 1 degrees C. (25 to 34 degrees F.)
Frost-free period: 32 to 103 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Drashner, Kluna, Rocklake, Taral, and Tonsina soils.
Drashner soils are somewhat poorly drained, have a histic epipedon, and occur on mountains and hillslopes.
Kluna soils are well drained, have stratified horizons of sandy and silty alluvium, and occur on stream terraces and floodplains.
Rocklake soils are shallow to bedrock and typically occur on ridge lines and escarpments.
Taral soils are well drained, have a deep (>40 cm, 16 in thick) mollic epipedon, and occur on mountain and hill slopes greater than 25 percent.
Tonsina soils are well drained, have a deep (>40 cm, 16 in thick) mollic epipedon, and occur on loess covered glacial till in till plains, hills and drumlins.
