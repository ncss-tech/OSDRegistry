COULTERG SERIES

The Coulterg series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or alluvium derived from calcareous and gypsiferous shale, and from sandstone, siltstone, and limestone.  Coulterg soils are on mountain slopes, hills, and alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 10 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Entic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Coulterg loam, in coniferous forest.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    A1--0 to 14 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 5 percent channers; slightly effervescent moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 15 inches thick.)

    A2--14 to 19 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 5 percent channers; strongly effervescent (7 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Bky1--19 to 30 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 5 percent channers; violently effervescent (10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); common fine gypsum crystals; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 20 inches thick)

    Bky2--30 to 60 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 3 percent cobbles, 3 percent flagstones; violently effervescent (14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); common fine gypsum crystals; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Barvon, Mavreeso, and Rottulee series.  
The Azar, Minnimaud, Roundup, and Twin Creek series may be competitors when their classification is updated.
Azaar:  has a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.
Barvon and Minnimaud:  have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.
Mavreeso, and Twin Creek:  have hue of 7.5YR or redder.
Rottulee:  have limestone bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.
Roundup:  have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium or alluvium derived from calcareous and gypsiferous shale, and from sandstone, siltstone, and limestone.
Landform:  hills, mountain slopes, and alluvial fans.
Slopes:  10 to 60 percent
Elevation: 7,200 to 9,500 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  39 to 43 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  16 to 18 inches.
  Wettest months:  July and August receive slightly more precipitation than other months.
  Driest months:  May and June receive the least precipitation.
