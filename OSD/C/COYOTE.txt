COYOTE SERIES

The Coyote series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in granitic alluvium. The Coyote soils are on upper sideslopes and summits of highly dissected erosional fan remnants. Slope ranges from 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 66 degrees F.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, thermic Durinodic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  On Coyote-Cronese complex, 2 to 30 percent slopes at an elevation of 2,465 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is covered with 75 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Macagce (T CA) and Narea (T CA) series. Macagce soils have a calcium carbonate equivalence of 10 to 20 percent in the calcic horizon and contain 45 to 65 percent coarse and very coarse sand. Narea soils are 20 to 30 inches to the durinodic layer and are in drainage ways. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Coyote soils are on upper sideslopes and summits of highly dissected fan remnants.  Slope ranges from 2 to 30 percent. The soils formed in material from granitic sources. Elevations are 1,800 to 3,200 feet. The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and cool winters. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 7 inches. The mean annual temperature is 61 to 70 degrees F.  Mean July temperature is about 78 degrees F., and mean January temperature is about 42 degrees F. The frost-free season is 240 to 340 days.  

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arizo, Cajon and Cronese soils. Arizo soils are sandy-skeletal and are found in included inset fans. Cajon soils are also found in included inset fans and have a sandy particle size control section. Cronese soils are coarse-loamy and are on similar landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; negligible to medium runoff; moderately rapid or rapid permeability in the surface layer and rapid permeability below.  

USE AND VEGETATION:  Coyote soils are used for military exercises and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly annual grasses and perennial shrubs such as white bursage, creosotebush, range ratany and desert needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mojave Desert of southeastern California.  The series is of small extent in MLRA-30.
