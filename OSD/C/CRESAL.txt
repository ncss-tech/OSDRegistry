CRESAL SERIES

The Cresal series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess high in volcanic ash over lacustrine sediments.  The Cresal soils are on lake plain and basin floor remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TYPE LOCATION:  Pershing County, Nevada; approximately 8 miles southwest of Jungo in a unsurveyed area about 7,700 feet east and 100 feet south of the northeast corner of section 12, T. 34 N., R. 31 E.; latitude 40 degrees 50 minutes 03 seconds N and longitude 118 degrees 23 minutes 54 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.8340000 latitude, -118.401389 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist for short periods in the winter and spring, dry May through early November; typic aridic soil moisture regime.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cren, Moranch, Risbeck, Tulase, and Wahluke series.  

Cren soils have a mean annual soil temperatures of 8 to 12 degrees C., and are 38 to 76 cm deep to the Bkq horizons that lack silica coats and bridges on ped surfaces.  Moranch soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 10 degrees C. and are continuously weakly silica cemented within 100 cm. Risbeck, Tulase and Wahluke soils lack lenses of volcanic glass in the 2C horizon and have an aridic soil moisture regime that borders on xeric.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cresal soils are on lake plain and basin floor remnants.  These soils formed in loess high in volcanic ash over lacustrine sediments. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations are 1,200 to 1,300 meters.  The climate is cool, arid with cool, moist winters and hot dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm; mean annual temperature is 9 to 13 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 110 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Boton and Mazuma soils.  Boton soils are fine-silty.  Mazuma soils are coarse-loamy.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained, ponded or slow runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly shadscale and cheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 24, 27.
