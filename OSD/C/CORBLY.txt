CORBLY SERIES

The Corbly series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans and outwash plains.  Slopes are 0  to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Entic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Corbly very gravelly sandy loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 5 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; loose, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; 40 percent pebbles and 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual smooth boundary. (4 to 7 inches thick)

    AC--5 to 12 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; 40 percent pebbles and 10 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick)

    Ck1--12 to 22 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely gravelly loamy sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine and few medium roots; common distinct lime coatings on underside of coarse fragments; 50 percent pebbles and 15 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); diffuse smooth boundary. (8 to 20 inches thick)

    Ck2--22 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely gravelly sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common distinct lime coatings on underside of coarse fragments; 60 percent pebbles and 15 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Corbly soils are used mainly for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Potential native vegetation may include bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, sedges, needleandthread, lupine, western yarrow, pussytoes, rose, common snowberry and skunkbush sumac as well as other grasses, forbs and woody shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Corbly soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Gallatin County, Montana, 1997.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record: MT1622. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: a mollic epipedon from the surface to 12 inches (A, AC horizons); horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation from 12 to 60 inches (Ck1, Ck2 horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Ck1, Ck2 horizons).  Corbly soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
