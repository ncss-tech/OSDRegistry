GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cleghorn soils are on fans remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks such as basalt, tuff, and andesite.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  Elevations range from 4,000 to 5,350 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 14 inches including 10 to 30 inches of annual snowfall.  The mean annual temperature is 44 to 49 degrees F., the mean January temperature is about 28 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is about 67 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brubeck, Gerlach, Longcreek, and Ravendale soils.  Brubeck, Gerlach, and Ravendale soils are fine and have cracks that open and close from the surface to 20 inches at some time during the year.  Longcreek soils are clayey-skeletal and shallow to lithic contacts.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; high surface runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Cleghorn soils are used for rangeland, hay, and small grain production.  The vegetation in rangeland is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, Thurber's needlegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern California.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 23.
