CHILLIWACK SERIES

The Chilliwack series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and glacial drift on debris aprons, valley walls, bedrock benches, and Pleistocene moraines.  Slopes are 15 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1,800 millimeters.  The mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in this family.  The Benka, Chulitna, Kashwitna, Nancy, and Soldotna series have mixed mineralogy, silt loam textures, and mean annual soil temperature of less than 3 degrees C. The Shoestring series has mixed mineralogy and a 2Bs horizon with 30 to 45 percent pumice fragments.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Chilliwack soils are on debris aprons, valley walls, bedrock benches, and Pleistocene moraines at elevations 900 to 1,800 meters.  Slopes are 5 to 55 percent. These soils formed in volcanic ash and glacial drift.  The climate consists of cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1,800 to 3,000 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 2 to 6 degrees C.  Frost-free season is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Maggib (T), Mox (T), Noca (T), and Spickard (T) soils.  Maggib soils are moderately deep and form on bedrock benches.  Mox soils have higher organic carbon accumulation in the Bs horizons and form on the most stable portions of bedrock benches and Pleistocene moraines.  Noca soils lack strong spodic horizons and form on slightly less stable portions of all the same landforms.  Spickard soils lack albic or spodic horizons and form on younger portions of debris aprons and valley walls.  

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained, high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for watershed, recreation, woodland and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is western hemlock, Pacific silver fir and minor western redcedar with an understory of queencup beadlily, twinflower, rattlesnake plantain, huckleberry, and Cascade azalea. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western slopes of the North Cascade Mountains, Washington.  MLRA 3.  Series is of small extent.
