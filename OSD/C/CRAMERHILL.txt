Drainage Class--well drained
Surface Runoff--low
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity Class--moderately high to high in the human- transported materials; high to very high in the underlying fluviomarine materials; lower in areas where compacted mechanically (vibratory) or static (heavy traffic).

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses--These soils are used for residential, commercial, and recreational development in an urban or suburban setting.
Vegetation--Vegetation may include a mix of managed and unmanaged plant communities with a mix of native and non-native species. Many areas are vegetated with non-native ornamental landscaping and/or turfgrass associated with developed land uses. Some areas may exhibit weedy, invasive, and/or primary succession vegetation communities (e.g., abandoned lots and other unmanaged areas). Some small patches of mixed native hardwood forest may be present in undisturbed areas.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
General Area--Urban corridors of the Northern Coastal Plain with anthropogenic landscapes.
Land Resource Regions--S - North Atlantic Slope Diversified Farming Region MLRA--149A
Extent--small extent.
