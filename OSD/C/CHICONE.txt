TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, active, acid, mesic Thapto-Histic Fluvaquents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Chicone mucky silt loam, on a smooth 0 percent slope, in a wooded flood plain. (Colors are for moist soil, unless otherwise noted).

     A--0 to 3 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) mucky silt loam; weak fine granular structure; friable; slightly sticky, nonplastic; many very fine and fine and common medium roots; common very fine and fine pores; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. (2 to 40 inches thick)

     Cg1--3 to 15 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) silt loam, gray (10YR 6/2) dry; massive; friable; slightly sticky, nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine pores; common fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) iron accumulations; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

     Cg2--15 to 24 inches; black (N 2/0) silt loam; massive; firm; slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common very fine roots; few very fine pores; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.

     Oa--24 to 65 inches; black (10YR 2/1) muck, sapric soil material; fiber content is 10 percent of the soil volume after rubbing; 20 percent, by weight, mineral soil material; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. (16 to 45 inches thick)

     C'g--65 to 72 inches; gray (10YR 6/1) sand; single grain; loose; strongly acid.

Texture--mucky silt loam, mucky loam, or silt loam

Cg horizon:
Colo--hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 5, chroma 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 2 to 5
Texture--loam or mucky silt loam. Some pedons may have thin layers of sandy loam, or loam

COMPETING SERIES: None

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: Coastal Plain
Landform: Flood plains
Elevation: 0 to 20 feet
Parent Material: Loamy fluvial sediments underlain by highly decomposed organic material, dominantly from woody plants
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 52 to 58 degrees F.
Mean Annual Precipitation: 24 to 48 inches
Frost Free Period: 190 to 210 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Fallsington soils--have a fine-loamy particle-size control section and an argillic horizon, on slightly higher positions
Hurlock soils--have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section and an argillic horizon, on slightly higher positions
Pone soils--have an umbric epipedon and an argillic horizon, on slightly higher positions
Puckum soils--have organic soil materials from the surface to more than 51 inches, on slightly lower-lying landforms

USE: Mainly wetland wildlife habitat

VEGETATION: Dominant vegetation is red maple (Acer rubrum), sweet gum (Liquidambar stryaciflua), american holly (Ilex opaca), water oak (Quercus nigra), sweetbay (Magnolia virginiana), and arrowwood (Viburnum dentatum).  Common understory species are greenbriar (Smilax spp.), sedges (Carex spp.), ferns (Polystichum spp.), and mosses.

DISTRIBUTION: Lower Coastal Plain of Maryland and Delaware

REMARKS: This soil was previously included in the swamp miscellaneous areas or as an inclusion in the Johnston series.

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 3 inches (A horizon)
