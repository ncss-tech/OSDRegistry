CLURO SERIES

The Cluro series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loess over alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Cluro soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture: Usually moist in winter and spring months, dry in summer and fall; Aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 10 to 11 degrees C.
Depth to base of cambic horizon: 30 to 43 cm.
Depth to horizons with durinodes: 33 to 50 cm.

Other features: Buried A horizons are common in most pedons.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Clurde Series.  Clurde soils do not have redox concentrations of iron or endosaturation between 120 and 180 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cluro soils are on nearly level stream terraces.  These soils formed in loess high in volcanic ash over alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,340 to 1,435 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 9 to 10 degrees C., mean summer temperature is 62 to 65 degrees F.; and the frost-free period is 95 to 115 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Iron Blossom, Midas, Ocala, and Orovada soils.  Iron Blossom and Ocala soils do not have cambic horizons and are calcareous throughout.  Midas soils are loamy-skeletal.  Orovada soils are coarse-loamy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; medium surface runoff; moderately slow permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  These soils were formed under more poorly drained conditions than are present today.  Entrenchment of stream channels due to normal meandering has caused the water table to drop below 120 cm.  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 120 and 150 cm (deep free water occurrence class) between February and June.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  A drained phase is recognized.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Cluro soils are used for livestock grazing.  The vegetation consists of basin big sagebrush, black greasewood, cheatgrass, and mustard.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Nevada.  These soils are not extensive with about 9,500 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 24.
