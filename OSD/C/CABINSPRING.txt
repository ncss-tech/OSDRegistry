CABINSPRING SERIES

The Cabinspring series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and colluvium over residuum derived from rhyodacite. Cabinspring soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes are 20 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-skeletal, glassy, frigid Vitritorrandic Argixerolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Cabinspring gravelly ashy loam--on a hill sloping 23 percent to the west at an elevation of 1,770 meters--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. When described on October 6, 2000 the soil was dry throughout.)

(0 to 20 cm thick) 

  2R--91 cm; fractured rhyodacite; cracks are spaced 15 to 20 cm apart and contain illuvial clay. 

TYPE LOCATION: Lake County, Oregon; in the Glass Buttes along the access road to the radio tower atop the summit of Glass Butte; approximately 1,400 feet north and 2,400 feet west of the southeast corner of section 27, T. 23 S., R. 22 E.; USGS Glass Butte 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 43 degrees 32 minutes 43 seconds N and longitude 120 degrees 03 minutes 55 seconds W; NAD 83.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cagas, Derallo, Glassbutte, Jacksplace, Roughridge , and Slockey series. 

Cagas soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts. Derallo soils are deep to paralithic contacts. Glassbutte soils are very deep. Jacksplace soils have mollic epipedons less than 50 cm thick and average 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Roughridge soils are 127 to 200 cm deep to paralithic contacts.  Slockey soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and September due to convection storms. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cabinspring soils are on hills and mountains. They typically occur on south and west-facing backslope positions. These soils formed in volcanic ash and colluvium over residuum derived from volcanic rocks such as rhyodacite. Slopes are 20 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 1,435 to 1,955 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Derallo and Jacksplace soils. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; high surface runoff; slow permeability: moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Cabinspring soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The potential native vegetation is mountain big sagebrush, Idaho fescue, and bluebunch wheatgrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Oregon. These soils are not extensive with about 2,600 acres of the series mapped to date. MLRA 23.
