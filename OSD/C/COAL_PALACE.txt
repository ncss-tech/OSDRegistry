COAL PALACE SERIES

The Coal Palace series consists of very deep, well drained, very slowly to slowly permeable soils that formed in reclaimed mine spoils. Slopes range from 1 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 930 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil fragments and isolated peds of relict genetic horizons of pre-mined soils may be present in up to 10 percent of the volume; randomly distributed throughout and are disordered relative to any plane in the profile.
Soil fragments: with identifiable properties such as redoximorphic features, higher chroma, clay films, or coatings that are characteristic of their previous formation. Particle-size control section: averages 35 to 50 percent clay.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. The Foyil, Hollybrook and Talala soil are in the same subgroup but are nonacid. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Coal Palace soils are on slopes of hills and valleys constructed after strip mining operations. Reclamation operations resulted in landforms similar to pre-mining contours. Slopes range from 1 to 18 percent. The soils were excavated and replaced with loamy and clayey material weathered from shale of Pennsylvanian age. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 875 to 1000 mm (34 to 39 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 9 to 11 degrees C (48 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 145 to 230 days. Elevation is 100 to 305 meters above mean sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Keswick, Lindley, Munterville, and Nodaway soils. These soils have not been disturbed by mining activities.
Keswick--are on higher landscape positions on side slopes.
Lindley--are on higher landscape positions on side slopes.
Munterville--are on convex side slopes and escarpment-like areas that parallel major streams.
Nodaway--are on lower landscape positions on flood plains.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Potential for surface runoff is high to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low to moderately high (0.1 - 10 micrometers per second) in the upper part of the series control section. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is very low to moderately low (0.01 - 1.0 micrometers per second) in the lower part.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for pasture and light grazing, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  Vegetation mainly consists of cool season pasture mixes that include alfalfa, clover, redtop, brome, timothy, and a variety of other cool season species. Warm season vegetation consists of a variety of grasses such as Big Bluestem, Indian grass, Canada Wild Rye, and forbs such as coneflowers, asters, and goldenrod among others.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Illinois and Iowa Deep Loess and Drift (MLRA 108) and Iowa and Missouri Heavy Till Plain (MLRA 109). The series is of small extent.

SERIES PROPOSED: Mahaska County, Iowa, 2025. The name is from the Coal Palace Exhibition center that stood in Ottumwa, Iowa from 1890 until 1892.

REMARKS:
These soils are the result of pre-1994 strip mining. The landscape was returned to its original elevation and contour, and topsoil was created by incorporating organic matter into the reshaped mine spoil. The subsurface is formed in replaced soil and pararock fragments from loess, till, shale and sandstone of Pennsylvanian age. The substratum is a mixture of shale and sandstone overburden moved during mining. Any redox features present in the profile are not indicators of modern drainage conditions.

Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: the zone from 25 to 40 cm.
Series control section: the zone from 0 to a depth of 65 cm.
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 12 cm. 
Densic contact: at a depth of 40 cm.
