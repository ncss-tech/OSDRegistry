CROTALUS SERIES

The Crotalus series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in colluvium derived from tuff modified by eolian material. Crotalus soils are on mountain flanks and bases. Slope ranges from 15 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.

REMARKS:

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle size control section:  the zone from 10 to 40 inches (Bk2 and Bk3)

Ochric epipedon:  the zone from 0 to 7 inches (A and Bk1 horizons)

Calcic horizon:  the zone from 27 to 60 inches (Bk3 and Bk4 horizons)

Ustic feature:  soil has aridic moisture that borders on the ustic moisture regime.

The assignment of the cation exchange capacity is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
