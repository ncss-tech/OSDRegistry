COBRE SERIES

The Cobre series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuff and tuffaceous sedimentary rocks.  Cobre soils are on pediments and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  At present, there are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cobre soils are on pediments and hills.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuff or tuffaceous sedimentary rocks, such as siltstone.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,650 to 2,015 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 115 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Izar and Jackpot soils.  Izar soils are shallow to lithic contacts.  Jackpot soils are shallow to paralithic contacts.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Cobre soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, Douglas rabbitbrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive. MLRAs 25 and 28B.
