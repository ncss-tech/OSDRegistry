CAZADERO SERIES

The Cazadero series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium.  Cazadero soils are on mountainous areas and have slopes of 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 72 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, mesic Rhodic Paleudults

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cazadero silty clay loam - cultivated.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap1--0 to 6 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) light silty clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/3) dry; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; 5 percent fine and medium concretions; strongly acid (pH 5.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 7 inches thick)

    Ap2--6 to 12 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) silty clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/3) dry; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine tubular pores; 5 percent fine and medium concretions; moderately acid (pH 6.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 7 inches thick)

    B1--12 to 21 inches; yellowish red (5YR 3/6) silty clay loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) dry; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky; hard, firm, slightly sticky and plastic; many very fine tubular pores; few fine hard concretions; moderately acid (pH 5.9); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 11 inches thick)

    Bt1--21 to 30 inches; yellowish red (5YR 3/6) silty clay, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) dry; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many very fine tubular pores; common moderately thick dark red (2.5YR 3/6) clay films on faces of peds and in pores; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear smooth boundary.  (7 to 11 inches thick)

    Bt2--30 to 41 inches; yellowish red (5YR 3/6) clay, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) dry; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many very fine tubular pores; common moderately thick dark red (2.5YR 3/6) clay films on faces of peds; strongly acid (pH 5.4); gradual smooth boundary.  (7 to 12 inches thick)

    2Bt3--41 to 50 inches; dark red (2.5YR 3/6) heavy clay, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) dry; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, weakly brittle, sticky and plastic; many very fine tubular pores; many moderately thick dark red (2.5YR 3/6) clay films on faces of peds; few medium black stains; strongly acid (pH 5.2); clear smooth boundary.  (7 to 12 inches thick)

    2BCt1--50 to 61 inches; dark red (2.5YR 3/6) heavy clay, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) dry; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, brittle, sticky and plastic; many very fine tubular pores; common moderately thick dark red (2.5YR 3/6) clay films on faces of peds, strongly acid (pH 5.3); gradual smooth boundary.  (9 to 14 inches thick)

    2BCt2--61 to 75 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) heavy clay, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) dry; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, brittle, sticky and plastic; many very fine tubular pores; common fine black stains; few moderately thick dark red (2.5YR 3/6) clay films on faces of peds, strongly acid (pH 5.3).

TYPE LOCATION:  Clackamas County, Oregon; 1,200 feet west and 1,300 feet south of Dunn and Boothroad intersection; northeast 1/4 southwest 1/4 northwest 1/4, sec. 3, T. 2 S., R. 4 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is usually moist and is dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for less than 45 consecutive days during the summer and has a udic moisture regime.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 52 to 54 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Thickness of the solum commonly is 60 inches or more but ranges to 40 inches in some pedons.

The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam or heavy silt loam.

The Bt2 horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  It is silty clay or clay and averages about 45 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon.  Below the upper 20 inches or the 2Bt horizon the clay ranges to 60 percent in individual horizons.  It is underlain by variegated weathered rock fragments of mixed origin and occasionally weathered andesite at depths commonly more than 60 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Drayke and Rapidan series.  Drayke and Rapidan soils have sola of 60 inches or less.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Cazadero soils are on mountainous areas with moderate to strong slopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent.  Aspect is generally west, some northwest, some southwest but dominantly toward the west at 600 to 1,500 feet elevation.  The soils formed in very old mixed alluvium that has been influenced by local mountain glaciers from Mt. Hood.  The climate is characterized by cool moist winters and warm dry summers.  The average July temperature is 65 degrees F; average January temperature is 37 degrees F; average annual temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F; and the average annual rainfall ranges from 60 to 85 inches.  The frost-free season is 140 to 200 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Borges, Cottrell and Mershon soils.  Borges soils are poorly drained, mottled, and lack argillic horizons.  Cottrell soils are moderately well drained, have mottles above depth of 30 inches and have hue yellower than 5YR.  Mershon soils are fine-silty and lack an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The soils are cropped to berries, nursery crops, vegetable crops, hay, pasture and cereal grains.  Other uses are for homesites, recreation and wildlife.  Native vegetation dominantly consists of Douglar-fir, hemlock, western redcedar, alder, vine maple, brackenfern, swordfern, wild blackberry and salal.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Willamette Valley, Oregon.  The series is inextensive.
