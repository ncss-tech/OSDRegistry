COALVALE SERIES

The Coalvale series consists of very deep, moderately well drained and somewhat poorly drained soils on uplands.  These soils  formed in spoils  of  surface mining which have been smoothed.  The spoils contained geologic materials that are less than strongly cemented, soil material and rock fragments.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 42 to 46 inches and the mean annual temperature is 59 to 63 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, spolic, mixed, active, nonacid, thermic Anthroportic Udorthents

Emachaya: less clay, has more fragments that are strongly cemented, more sand, slower permeability.
Ironbridge: less clay, has more fragments that are strongly cemented, more sand, slower permeability.
Latimer: formed in sodic reclamation materials, periodic flooding, has more fragments that are strongly cemented, more sand, slower permeability.
Thermo (tentative): warmer, very slowly permeable, fewer rock and pararock fragments.
Whitefield: moderately deep, less clay, slower permeability.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: native soils in the Cherokee Prairies major land resource area (MLRA 112) and the underlying middle Pennsylvanian geology all of which have been moved by mining and reclamation activities.
Landscape:  Uplands
Landform: summits, shoulders, backslopes, footslopes and toeslopes that have been created and/or altered by earth moving equipment.
Slopes:  0 to 12 percent
Mean annual temperature:  59 to 63 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  42 to 46 inches.
P-E index : 66 to 78.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Brazilton and Kanima soils on surface-mined areas, and the Cherokee, Dennis, Parsons and Zaar soils on adjacent or nearby undisturbed areas. Brazilton soils have less than 15 percent pararock and rock fragments above 40 inches.  Kanima soils are on adjacent non-reclaimed areas.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage: moderately well drained on summits, shoulders and backslopes, somewhat poorly drained on footslopes and toeslopes.
Permeability: moderately slow 
Runoff: medium on gentle slopes and high on steeper slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are typically managed as pasture.  Some areas are used for home sites and recreation.  Common plants managed in pastures are fescue, Korean lespedeza and bermudagrass.  Woody species, annual forbs and annual grasses are common invaders in many areas where managed plants do not survive.  Home sites are often located near water bodies that were created by mining and/or reclamation.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Kansas, southwestern Missouri and northeastern Oklahoma.  LRR M; MLRA 112.  The series is of limited extent.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  the zone from 10 to 39 inches.  (C1 and C2 horizons)
Ochric epipedon: The zone from 0 to 3 inches.  (A horizon)
Diagnostic horizon fragments:  Fragments of argillic horizons are present in random locations in the profile.  While the remnant clay films were not visible under field conditions at the time of sampling, the brown silty clay material appears to be remnant argillic horizon.  Photomicrographs of a pedon 150 feet east (S99KS037001) of the type location shows a clay film.  Many pedons have fragments of mollic epipedons and argillic horizons through the profile. 

The assignment of cation-exchange activity class is supported by lab sample(s) numbers S99KS037001 and S99KS037002.

Taxonomic Version:  Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999 and Keys to Soil Taxonomy Eighth Edition, 1998 (for identification of horizons only)

03/2020 Updated Taxonomic Class based on Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014. 

Formerly these soils were mapped as Kanima soil series.

The multiple, artificially created landform segments on which this soil occurs creates a range of drainage classes and soil moisture regimes.

The parafragments in this soil may cause lab analysis to underestimate the percent clay in the fine earth fraction.  Sample preparation which crushes the parafragments may increase the sand and silt fractions relative to clay.
