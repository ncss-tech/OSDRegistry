COCHETOPA SERIES

The Cochetopa series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and alluvium derived mainly from basalt and rhyolitic tuff.  Cochetopa soils are on mountain slopes, hills, and valley sides.  Slopes range from 5 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Gunnison County, Colorado, 1974.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon: from 0 to 20 inches (A, BAt, and Bt1 horizons)
Argillic horizon: The zone from 12 to 40 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and BCt horizons)
Particle-size control section; The zone from 12 to 32 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)

This revision (10/98) limits the range in characteristics to more closely match the original concept of this series.  Soils without rock fragments or without stones as the dominant fraction are now excluded.  Sandstone and shale are excluded from the parent material.  This series was determined to be mainly in the ustic moisture regime; the upper limit of average annual precipitation was reduced from 30 to 22 inches.  Soils that border a udic regime (and are typically forested) are now excluded from the series concept.

Keys to Soil Taxonomy:  classified according to the 8th edition, 1998.
