CANDELARIA SERIES

The Candelaria series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Candelaria soils are on ballenas and fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Zerk series.  Zerk soils are not moist for 10 to 20 days in the summer and have soil temperatures of less than 11 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Candelaria soils are on fan piedmonts, fan remnants and ballenas.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The climate is cool, arid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Elevations are 1,340 to 2,147 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 11 to 15 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 120 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Izo, Gynelle and Wardenot soils.  These soils all lack a calcic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow or medium runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly shadscale, spiny menodora, kochia, Cooper wolfberry, bud sagebrush and galleta.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  West-central Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 27, 28B and 29.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Esmeralda County, Nevada, 1984.

REMARKS:  As a result of the recent addition of the Duric Calciorthids subgroup, the classification of this soil is being changed from Typic to Duric in 1991. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the surface to 18 cm. A1, A2 and part of Bk horizons).
Calcic horizon - The zone from 10 to 97 cm (Bk, 2Bqk and 3Ck horizons).
Duric feature - The zone from 25 to 41 cm (2Bqk horizon).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (2Bqk, 3Ck and part of the 3C1 horizons).
