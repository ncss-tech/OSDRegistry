CHEMULT SERIES

The Chemult series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils on flood plains of a lava plateau. These soils formed in grassy organic material over diatomaceous earth over alluvium from pumice. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape - lava plateau 

Landform - flood plains 

Elevation - 4560 to 5415 feet 

Slope- 0 to 2 percent 

Parent material - organic grassy material over diatomaceous earth over alluvium from Mt. Mazama ash and pumice 

Climate - cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers 

Mean annual air temperature - 41 to 45 degrees F 

Mean January air temperature - 25 to 27 degrees F 

Mean July air temperature - 57 to 60 degrees F 

Mean annual precipitation - 20 to 36 inches 

Frost free period - 5 to 35 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Lapine, Chinchallo and Cosbie soils. Lapine soils are on adjacent plateaus formed in volcanic ash and pumice, are excessively drained. Chinchallo soils have an ochric epipedon over diatomaceous earth having an n Value of less than 0.7. Cosbie soils are in nearby drainageways and have an ochric epipedon. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage - very poorly drained 

Permeability - very slow 

Flooding - very frequent 

Ponding - frequent 

Water table - an apparent high water table is at its uppermost limit from January to December 

USE AND VEGETATION: Chemult soils are used for wildlife habitat, watershed and recreation. The potential natural plant community is the wet shrublands plant association group (SWXX). A willow/Northwest Territory sedge plant association (SW11-16) is commonly supported. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Klamath County, Oregon; MLRA 6. Series is of small extent.
