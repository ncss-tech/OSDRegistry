CEDARFALLS SERIES


The Cedarfalls series consists of deep, well drained, soils formed in loamy and sandy colluvium at the base of sandstone outcrops on uplands. Permeability is rapid.  Slopes range
from 30 to 70 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, siliceous, mesic Typic Udorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Cedarfalls coarse sandy loam - on a 65 percent concave slope, at an elevation of 996 feet above msl, in forest. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Oi--0 to 1 inch; undecomposed leaf litter.

 A--1 to 6 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) coarse sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many fine and medium roots; 5 percent sandstone fragments; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. (1 to 6 inches thick)

 C1--6 to 12 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) coarse sandy loam; massive; very friable; few fine and medium roots; 5 percent quartzite gravel; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. (6 to 10 inches thick)

 C2--12 to 21 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loamy coarse sand; single grained; loose; few fine and medium roots; 10 percent sandstone fragments; very strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.

 C3--21 to 58 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) coarse sand; single grained; loose; very strongly acid; abrupt irregular boundary.

 R--58 to 60 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) hard sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION: Hocking County, Ohio; near Cantwell Cliffs in Laurel Township; 1600 feet south and 2000 feet east of the northwest corner of sec. 4, T. 12 N., R. 18 W; Rockbridge quadrangle, lat. 39 degrees 32 minutes 34.45 seconds N and long. 82  degrees 34 minutes 26.09 seconds W, NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to bedrock [commonly] ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Rock fragments, mainly quartzite and sandstone gravel, range from 0 to 10 percent in the A horizon and 0 to 30 percent in the C horizon, but include up to 30 percent stones and boulders in the lower part of the C horizon.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR , value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. Textures are sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand. Reaction is strongly acid to extremely acid.

The C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Textures are sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand.  Reaction is strongly acid to extremely acid.

COMPETING SERIES: The Cedarfalls series is the only member in the family. Related series in other families include the Rigley, Schaffenaker, and Vanderlip series. Rigley soils have an argillic horizon. Schaffenaker and Vanderlip soils are Psamments; and in addition, Schaffenaker soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Vanderlip soils contain thin lamellae.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cedarfalls soils formed in loamy and sandy colluvium on foot slopes at the base of sandstone outcrops or escarpments. The slope gradient ranges from 30 to 70 percent. The soils formed in recent colluvium
mainly from sandstone with a minor amount of siltstone. Climate is humid and temperate. The mean annual temperature ranges from about 51 to 53 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from about 39 to 41 inches. However, there is a microclimate within the gorges and canyons that is cooler and more moist than typical for the area.  Frost
free days range from 155 to 165 days per year.  Elevation  ranges from 950 to 1050 feet above sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dekalb, Lily, and Shelocta soils. Dekalb soils are loamy-skeletal and are on very steep back slopes. Lily and Shelocta soils are fine-loamy. However, Lily soils are moderately deep to sandstone and are on summit positions; whereas, Shelocta soils are deep to interbedded sandstone, siltstone, and shale and are on back slopes, benches, and foot slopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. The potential for surface runoff is high to very high.  Permeability is rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION: Nearly all areas of Cedarfalls series are wooded. Hemlock and aspen are predominant tree species because of the cooler and more moist microclimate.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA is 124. Southeastern Ohio. Cedarfalls soils are of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Hocking County, Ohio, 1986.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - the zone from a depth of about 1 to 6 inches (A horizon); lithic contact - at a depth of about 58 inches.

02/2022 revision: Oi had 1 to 0 inch depths, corrected to be 0 to 1 in horizon depths then added 1 inches to all horizon depths throughout the typical pedon. WJN
