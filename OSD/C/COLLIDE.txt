COLLIDE SERIES

The Collide series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian and reworked eolian material derived from sandstone.  Collide soils are on terraces and fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Aridic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Collide loam in irrigated hayland, 4 percent slope, southwest aspect.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap1--0 to 3 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear smooth boundary. 

    Ap2--3 to 10 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear smooth boundary. 

    Bt--10 to 29 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate coarse subangular blocky; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary.

    Btk1--29 to 40 inches; yellowish red (5YR 4/6) clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate coarse subangular blocky; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine seams of calcium carbonate; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary. 

    Btk2--40 to 50 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) clay loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate coarse subangular blocky; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common large soft masses of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. 

    Btk3--50 to 60 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) clay loam, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many large soft masses of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; 13 percent calcium carbonate; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4). 

TYPE LOCATION: Montezuma County, Colorado; about 2,560 feet east, and 1,200 feet south of the northwest  corner of sec. 31, T. 36 N., R. 13 W.; Mancos, Colorado USGS Quad; Lat. 37 degrees 20 minutes 19 seconds N. and long 108 degree 19 minutes 31 seconds W., NAD27

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture regime: ustic bordering on aridic

A horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 4 or 5 dry (2 or 3 moist)
Chroma: 2 or 3

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ashfork, Bethune, Blackpipe, Boneek, Boquillas, Chapin, Collbran, Emigrant, Huggins, Kube, Leyden, Loma, Nuncho, Nunn, Querc, Rednun, Richfield, Ryus, Savo, Showlow, Standley, Thunderbird, Torreon, and Wormser series.  Ashfork, Blackpipe, Bethune, Boquillas, Chapin, Emigrant, Leyden, Querc, Thunderbird, and Wormser soils have either a lithic or paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Boneek, Loma, and Rednun soils have less than 35 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section.  Huggins, Kube, Nuncho, Nunn, Richfield, Ryus, Savo, Standley, and Torreon soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower in the Bt horizons.  Showlow soils appear to have a lithologic discontinuity.  Collbran soils have basalt gravel and have developed from alluvium from sandstone and basalt.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: eolian and reworked eolian material derived from sandstone.  These deposits overlay old alluvial deposits from igneous sources.  Igneous gravel and cobbles may occur in the lower parts of some pedons.

Landform: terraces and fans

Slopes: 0 to 12 percent

Elevation: 7,000 to 7,600 feet

Mean annual temperature: 46 to 50 degrees F

Mean annual precipitation: 15 to 17 inches

Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year with July and August being slightly wetter and June being slightly dryer.

Frost-free period: 100 to 120 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Pogo, Sideshow and Zigzag soils.  Pogo soils have a water table at about 12 inches, and they are in drainageways.  Sideshow soils are on fans and have developed from Mancos shale.  Zigzag soils are on hills and ridges and are forming from Mancos Shale.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: well drained, medium to very high runoff, slow permeability

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used principally for irrigated pasture and hayland.  Alfalfa, orchardgrass and brome are the dominant plants.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwest Colorado.  LRR D, MLRA 36.  This series is of small extent.
