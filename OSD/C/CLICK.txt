CLICK SERIES

The Click series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in residuum weathered from granite of pre-Cambrian age. These gently sloping and moderately sloping soils are on shoulders and summits of ridges and hills. Slope ranges from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 18.9 degrees C (66 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 in).

Landscape: Dissected plateaus
Landform: Backslopes, shoulders and summits of ridges and hills
Slope: 1 to 8 percent, but are mostly 1 to 5 percent

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bauman and Keese series and the competing Lou and Voca series.
Bauman soils: have a natric horizon and occur on lower concave positions
Keese soils: have a paralithic contact with granite at a depth of 25 to 50 cm (10 to 20 in) and occur on higher backslopes, shoulders, and summits of ridges and hills.
Lou soils: are on backslopes, shoulders and summits of ridges and hills
Voca soils: are on undulating plains and footslopes of ridges and hills

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderately rapid. Runoff is low on 1 to 5 percent slopes, and medium on 5 to 8 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for rangeland. Some areas are used for wildlife land and improved pastures. The potential plant community is an open savannah of post oak, blackjack oak, and live oak with mid and tall grasses in thin stands. The dominant grass is little bluestem. Other grasses include sideoats grama, yellow Indiangrass, sandhill lovegrass, Arizona cottontop, fringeleaf paspalum, pinhole bluestem, vine mesquite and purpletop tridens. The dominant forbs include orange zexmenia, sagewort, snoutbean, and heath aster. The woody plants include post oak, blackjack oak and live oak. Continued heavy use causes further deterioration and plants such as mesquite, whitebrush, yucca, Ashe juniper, gummy lovegrass, Texas grama, prairie coneflower, and basin sneezeweed, invade or increase on the ecological site. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Texas. Southwest Plateaus and Plains Range and Cotton Region, LRR-I, MLRA 82A-Texas Central Basin. This series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Gillespie County, Texas; 1970.

REMARKS:
The Click series was described with paralithic contact between 100 and 150 cm (40 to 60 in). The series concept was changed based on a more accurate description of the typical pedon.

Edited 10/2016 (RFG-THW): Updated competing series, geographic setting, and associated soils sections.

Diagnostic horizons or features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 28 cm (0 to 11 in) (A horizon)
Argillic horizon: 28 to 115 cm (11 to 45 in) (Bt horizons)
Lithic contact: The contact with granite at 135 cm (53 in) (top of R layer)

ADDITIONAL DATA: Lab data available from the National Soil Survey Laboratory on pedon 82TX299002 (samples 82P04356-82P04362) and from the type location on pedon 87TX299004 (samples 87P02429-87P02433) from Llano County, TX.
