CESARIO SERIES

The Cesario series consists of deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils over slowly permeable shale.  These soils are on nearly level to gently undulating upland plains and pediments.  They formed in residuum derived from the Cretaceous Pen Clay Formation.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Armesa (NM), Fizzleflat (TX), and Karro (AZ) series. Armesa soils are inactive.  Karro soils do not have a paralithic contact within 60 inches of the soil surface.  Fizzleflat soils have a paralithic contact between 20 and 40 inches of the surface.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cesario soils are on nearly level to gently sloping upland plains and pediments.  These soils formed in residuum derived from the Cretaceous Age Pen Clay Formation.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches, with most occurring in the summer months.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 64 to 68 degrees F.  Frost free period ranges from 210 to 260 days.  Elevation ranges from 3,500 to 5,000 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cheosa, Fizzleflat, Loyplace, Mariscal, and Straddlebug series.  Cheosa soils are very shallow and shallow to a petrocalcic horizon, and are in the skeletal family.  They are on hillcrests capped with the Jeff Conglomerate member of the Pruett Formation.  Fizzleflat soils are on similar upland plains and pediments.  Loyplace soils are very shallow and shallow to a petrocalcic horizon, and have shale within 40 inches of the soil surface.  They are on slightly higher caliche-cemented footslope landforms.  Mariscal soils are in the loamy-skeletal family, and are very shallow and shallow to Boquillas Flag limestone bedrock, and are on adjacent hills.  Straddlebug soils are very deep, loamy soils that do not have a calcic horizon and are on alluvial flats and floodplains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained.  Permeability is moderately slow above slowly permeable shale bedrock.  Runoff is very low on 1 to 3 percent slopes and low on 3 to 5 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for livestock grazing.  Woody species in the overstory include creosotebush, tarbush, mesquite, whitethorn acacia, Warnock condalia, and wolfberry.  Grass species include burrograss, fluffgrass, bush muhly, tobosagrass, and red grama.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Trans-Pecos Texas in the Southern Desertic Basins, Plains, and Mountains (MLRA 42), Desert Grassland vegetative zone.  The soil is of moderately extensive.
