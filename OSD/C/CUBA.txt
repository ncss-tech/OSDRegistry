CUBA SERIES


The Cuba series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in acid, silty alluvium. These soils are on flood plains, flood-plain steps and natural levees. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1067 mm (42 inches).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, active, mesic Fluventic Dystrudepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Cuba silt loam on a nearly level area in a cultivated field at an elevation of 152 meters (500 feet) above sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

	Ap--0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; moderate medium granular structure; friable; many fine roots; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. (15 to 30 cm or 6 to 12 inches thick)

	Bw1--25 to 53 cm (10 to 21 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silt loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; friable; few fine roots; few distinct brown (10YR 4/3) organic coatings on faces of peds; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

	Bw2--53 to 119 cm (21 to 47 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; friable; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bw horizon is 61 to 107 cm or 24 to 42 inches.)

	C--119 to 152 cm (47 to 60 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam; common medium distinct light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) mottles; massive; friable; few fine distinct black (10YR 2/1) iron and manganese concretions; very strongly acid.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Cuba soils formed in acid, silty alluvium on flood plains, flood-plain steps and natural levees along major streams and their tributaries. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The alluvium is derived mainly from areas of loess capped sandstone, siltstone and shale hills, and loess capped till plains of the Illinoian stage. Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.5 to 14 degrees C (51 to 57 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 102 to 119 cm (40 to 47 inches). Frost free period is 170 to 210 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Cuba soils are commonly associated with the moderately well drained Steff, the somewhat poorly drained Stendal, and the poorly drained Bonnie soils. Cuba soils are on natural levees and alluvial fans, Steff and Stendal soils are on slightly lower lying flood-plain steps and Bonnie soils are on backswamps and on abandoned meander belts.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The potential for surface water runoff is very low or low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/s). Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of the soils are used for the production of crops such as corn and soybeans. Native vegetation is mixed hardwood forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Indiana, Kentucky, and southern Ohio. Cuba soils are of moderate extent and are within several MLRA's. The Type Location is in MLRA 120B.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Daviess County, Indiana, 1966.

REMARKS: The type location has been moved to Dubois County, Indiana to more accurately reflect the series concept. The CEC activity class is assigned on data from soils formed in similar parent materials.

The representative component and horizon data is in DMU# 358,279.

Diagnostic features and horizons recognized in this pedon are: 
1) Ochric epipedon: 0 to 25 cm  or 0 to 10 inches (Ap horizon) 
2) Cambic horizon: 25 to 119 cm  or 10 to 47 inches (Bw1, Bw2 horizons)
