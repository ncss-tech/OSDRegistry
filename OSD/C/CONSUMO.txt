TYPE LOCATION: Oeste SCD, Puerto Rico; 8 miles east of the city of Mayaguez; 100 feet west and 50 feet south of kilometer marker 13.5 on Highway 106. Latitude: 18 degrees 12 minutes 30.68 seconds north, Longitude: 67 degrees 2 minutes 15.73 seconds west WGS 84. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Thickness of the solum ranges: from 36 to 61 centimeters (14 to 24 inches)
Thickness of the argillic horizon: varies from 25 to 41 centimeters (10 to 16 inches)
Soil Reaction: very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout. 

Range of Individual Horizons:
A or Ap horizon:
Color - Hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6
Texture - sandy clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay, or clay

Bt horizon:
Color - Hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8
Texture - clay or silty clay
Content of saprolite ranges from 5 to 10 percent, by volume

BC horizon: 
Color - has the same range of colors as the Bt horizon
Texture - silty clay loam, silty clay or clay
Content of saprolite ranges from 40 to 60 percent, by volume

C horizon:
Color - no dominant color and is multicolored in shades of red, yellow, brown and gray
Texture - loam, silty clay loam, silt loam, or clay loam

COMPETING SERIES: The Daguao, Mariana and Naranjito soils are in the same family. All of these soils are on similar positions as Consumo soils but are moderately deep to bedrock. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: Mountains of the Humid Mountains and Valleys (MLRA 270).
Landform: Consumo soils are on summits and side slopes
Parent Material: They formed in fine over coarser textured residuum weathered from basic volcanic rock. 
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 24 to 26 degrees C. (75 to 78 degrees F.).
Mean Annual Precipitation: 1,854 to 2,032 millimeters (73 to 80 inches).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
These are the Anones, Daguey, Humatas, Morado, and Mucara series. All these soils are on similar landscape positions. 
Anones and Morado soils--are moderately deep and do not have argillic horizons
Daguey soils--have more clay in the control section and much thicker B horizons
Humatas soils--have more clay and thicker argillic horizons
Mucara soils--have less clay in the control section and lack argillic horizons

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class: Moderately well drained
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: Moderately high to high.

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major uses: Most areas of Consumo soils are used for coffee, pasture and food crops 
Dominant vegetation: The vegetation consists of native and introduced grasses, shrubs, and trees

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Humid Mountains and Valleys of Puerto Rico (MLRA 270). The series is of large extent. 

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon: 
1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches, Ap horizon). 
2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 15 to 36 centimeters (6 to 14 inches, Bt horizon).
