CARRACAS SERIES

The Carracas series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived from shale. Carracas soils are on hillslopes and mountain slopes. Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm and the mean annual air temperature is approximately 6.1 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, mixed, superactive, frigid, shallow Typic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Carracas clay loam, on a west facing, simple, 12 percent slope in ponderosa pine woodland at an elevation of 2,225 meters. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) When described on June 21, 1984 the soil was moist from 0 to 38 cm.

    A--0 to 8 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak thick platy structure parting to moderate medium granular structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; common very fine roots throughout; common fine and very fine tubular pores; 2 percent cobbles and 5 percent parachanners; slightly effervescent; 3 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 13 cm thick)

    Bk1--8 to 20 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium angular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky, very plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 10 percent parachanners; strongly effervescent; 8 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 30 cm thick)

    Bk2--20 to 38 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) clay, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium angular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky, very plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 14 percent parachanners; strongly effervescent; 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 20 cm thick)

    Cr--38 to 64 cm; weakly cemented shale bedrock, moderately alkaline.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: La Plata County (Piedra Area), Colorado, 1974. The current type location is in the Archuleta soil survey area. The name is from a small community in Archuleta County.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Cambic horizon: 8 to 38 cm (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)
Paralithic contact: 38 cm to unconsolidated shale bedrock (Cr layer)
Particle-size control section: 25 to 38 cm (part of the Bk2 horizon to bedrock)
Series control section: 0 to 25 inches (all horizons and upper 25 cm of the paralithic layer)

Carracas soils are in a frigid temperature regime with an ustic soil moisture class and a typic subclass.
