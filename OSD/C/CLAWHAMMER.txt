CLAWHAMMER SERIES

The Clawhammer series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in loamy and sandy eolian deposits on swales on interdunes on sandhills of the Nebraska Sandhills (MLRA 65). Permeability is moderate. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 46 centimeters (18 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. (48 degrees F.) at the type location.

Crowther, Elsmere, Nenzel, and Valentine soils do not have ESP greater than 15 or SAR of 13 or more.
Crowther soils are on similar or slightly lower swales on interdunes and are poorly and very poorly drained having a seasonal zone of saturation or aquic conditions beginning at the surface and having ponding on the very poorly drained soil up to 15 centimeters (6 inches).
Elsmere soils are on slightly higher swales on interdunes and are sandy in the control section.
Nenzel soils are on higher swales and hummocks on interdunes and are moderately well drained having a seasonal zone of saturation or aquic conditions beginning at 91 centimeters (36 inches).
Valentine soils are on higher dunes and are excessively drained having no seasonal zone of saturation or aquic conditions.
Wildhorse soils are on slightly higher swales on interdunes and are sandy in the control section.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Arthur County, Nebraska, 2009 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 29 centimeters (0 to11 inches) (the Ak horizon) 
Exchangeable sodium percentage: 0 to 200 centimeters (0 to 79 inches) (Ak, ACkg1, ACkg2, Cg1, Cg2, Cg3, and 2Abk horizons).
Sodium adsorption ratio: 0 to 173 centimeters (0 to 68 inches) (Ak, ACkg1, ACkg2, Cg1, Cg2, and Cg3 horizons).

Aquic soil conditions: 29 to 200 centimeters (11 to 79 inches) (ACkg1, ACkg2, Cg1, Cg2, Cg3, and 2Abk horizons). 
Clawhammer series is to replace the Lute soils that were mapped on interdunes on sandhills. Lute soils have been mapped on interdunes of sandhills and on stream terraces and floodplains of valleys in Sheridan and Holt Counties. The Official Series Description type location for the Lute series is not in the Nebraska sandhills and is in Tripp, County,
South Dakota. Lisco soils were considered during mapping for the coarse-loamy alkali soils in the sandhills in Cherry, Sheridan, and Garden Counties. These were correlated to Wildhorse soils. In Cherry County they were located with saline spot symbols on the Crowther and Cullison soils.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Pedon 08NE005041 which is the typical pedon for the series has been sampled for the National Soil Survey Center, Soil Survey Laboratory. Comparison data is also available for the Lute series: pedon 71SD123001 which is the type location for the Lute series and pedon 76NE089005 in Holt County. In Cherry County, Pedon
89NE031039 was sampled as Cullison and the SSL classified it as coarse-loamy, mixed, subactive, mesic Typic Halaquept.
