CEDARWASH SERIES

The Cedarwash series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granitoid. The Cedarwash soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 14 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Cedarwash gravelly fine sandy loam, on a northeast facing, linear, 3 percent slope under rangeland at an elevation of 1598 meters. (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted. 8/24/2012 actual site observation date.) The soil surface is covered by approximately 5 percent fine gravel, 10 percent medium and coarse gravel.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Betonnie, Bijou, Davishat (T), Terro, Terry, and Vonalee series. All these soils receive at least 250 millimeters (10 inches) of precipitation annually.  In addition, Betonnie, Terro, Terry and Vonalee soils are derived from sandstone. Terro and Terry soils are moderately deep (50 to 100 cm, 20 to 40 inches) to soft sandstone bedrock. Betonnie soils are 10 to 38 cm (4 to 15 inches) deep to the top of the argillic horizon. Bijou soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 13 degrees C (47 to 55 degrees C) and are 20 to 40 cm (8 to 16 inches) deep to the top of the argillic horizon. Davishat soils are derived from sandstone and limestone and have visible secondary calcium carbonates starting at a depth of 25 cm (10 inches) and a calcium carbonate equivalent in the substratum of 2 to 5 percent. Vonalee soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 10.5 degrees C (47 to 52 degrees F). 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Cedarwash soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. The soils formed in alluvium derived from granitoid. Elevation ranges from 1540 to 1710 meters. The mean annual precipitation is 175 to 225 mm. The mean annual air temperature is about 10 to 13 degrees C. The frost-free period is 160 to 200 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cetrepas and Midhills soils. The Cetrepas soils are on nearby low hills and are shallow to a paralithic contact with hard granitoid bedrock beneath the weathered bedrock and have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section. Midhills soils are on adjacent hills, have mollic epipedons and a lithic contact.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; low runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Cedarwash soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is big sagebrush, Utah juniper, black grama and big galleta.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Basin and Range of California, U.S.A.; MLRA 30. The series is of moderate extent.
