COMPETING SERIES: These are the Benka, Kashwitna, Shoestring, and Soldatna series. Benka soils have stratified substratums. Kashwitna and Soldatna soils have loess mantels less than 30 inches thick. Shoestring soils have moderately acid or slightly acid soil reactions in the B and C horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: ash influenced loess over glacial fluvial material
Landform: relic glacial lakes, terraces on till plains, and moraines on till plains 
Slope: 0 to 25 percent
Mean annual temperature: about 36 degrees F., (2 C.)
Mean annual precipitation: about 27 inches, (696 mm)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Benka, Kashwitna, Qutal, and Spenard soils. Benka and Kashwitna soils are well drained and occur on similar land forms. Qutal are somewhat poorly and occur on depressions on till plains. Spenard soils are poorly drained and occur on depressions on till plains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, very low to medium runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the solum and high or very high in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for Recreation, wildlife habitat, and woodland.  The native vegetation is Lutz spruce and paper birch.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 224, Cool Inlet Lowlands, South-Central Alaska. The series is of moderate extent.
