MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES PROPOSED: Talbot County, Maryland; 2000.

REMARKS: Crosiadore soils were previously mapped with the Barclay series. Crosiadore soils are different from Barclay by having an argillic horizon with a particle-size control section that is fine-silty rather than coarse-silty and by having a mesic temperature regime rather than thermic.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 10 inches (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 13 to 33 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Btg1, and 2Btg2 horizons)
Aquic conditions--the soil has redox depletions and concentrations within the upper 24 inches of the argillic horizon, with periodic saturation and reduction from January to May

Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Series Control Section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches

ADDITIONAL DATA: This pedon sampled as S00MD-041-021
