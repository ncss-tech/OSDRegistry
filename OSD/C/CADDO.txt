CADDO SERIES

The Caddo series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils. These nearly level soils formed in fluviomarine deposits derived from the Intermediate Terraces Formation of Pleistocene age. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 19.5 degrees C (67 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1549 mm (61in).

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE:  Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Caddo Parish, Louisiana; 1906.

REMARKS:  The series type location was moved to the current location during the Soil Data Join and Recorrelation initiative. The previous location in Beauregard Parish was in a coarse-silty family according to lab data. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 74 cm (0 to 29.1 in). (A and Eg horizons) 
Glossic horizon: 74 to 130 cm (29.1 to 51.2 in). (Btg/E horizon)
Argillic horizon: 74 to 203 cm (29.1 to 80 in). (Btg/E and Btg horizons)

Aquic conditions: 13 to 203 cm (5 to 80 in) during the winter and early spring months

ADDITIONAL DATA:  KSSL Data from type location on pedon 81LA019001.
