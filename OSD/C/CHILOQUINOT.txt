CHILOQUINOT SERIES

The Chiloquinot series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rock, diatomaceous silt and tephra. Chiloquinot soils are on flood plains and terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Aquic Cumulic Haploxerolls

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Raynal (T) series. The Raynal soils have 5 to 15 percent calcium carbonate throughout the profile.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chiloquinot soils are on narrow flood plains and stream terraces at elevations of 4,175 to 4,300 feet. The soils formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rock, diatomite and tephra. The climate is cool subhumid. The average annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 18 inches. The average January temperature is 27 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 62 degrees F.; and the average annual temperature is 43 to 46 degrees F. The frost-free period is 50 to 70 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Wolfbutte, Klamath, and Dilman soils. Wolfbutte soils are on terraces.  They are well drained, have argillic horizons and have a duripan at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Klamath soils are in depressions on floodplains. They have redoximorphic features at the surface and are very poorly drained.  Dilman soils are on floodplains.  They are poorly drained, and have ashy loamy coarse sand textures at a depth of 15 inches

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; moderate permeability. The soils are occasionally flooded for brief durations from February to April.  A seasonal high water table is at a depth of 21 to 33 inches from February to April.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for irrigated and dryland hay and pasture, and wildlife habitat. The series commonly supports silver sagebrush, green rabbitbrush, Idaho fescue, slender wheatgrass, meadow barley, iris and Sandberg bluegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Basins near the southern fringe of the pumice mantled region in south-central Oregon, MLRA 21. The series is inextensive.

SERIES PROPOSED: Klamath County, Oregon, 2005. 

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:
Mollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 21 inches (A1, A2, and A3 horizons)
Irregular decrease in organic carbon - the zone from 0 to 21 inches (A1, A2, and A3 horizons)
Cambic horizon - the zone from 33 to 60 inches (Eg1, Eg2, and Eg3 horizons)
Particle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of the A3, the AE, and part of the Eg1 horizons)
Aquic conditions - the zone from 21 to 60 inches (AE, Eg1, Eg2, and Eg3 horizons) 

Although the series is associated with other series having Vitrandic surfaces, the series is not classified as Vitrandic because the surface has less than 30 percent coarse silt or coarser fine earth material.
