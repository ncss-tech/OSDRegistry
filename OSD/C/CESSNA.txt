CESSNA SERIES

The Cessna series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from limestone and sandstone.  Cessna soils are on stream terraces and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Typic Xerofluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cessna loam - cropland.  (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A1--0 to 3 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) loam; pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, non sticky, non plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine vesicular pores; strongly effervescent, 22 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary.

    A2--3 to 10 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) loam; pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many very fine, and fine roots, many very fine and fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent, 27 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth boundary.

    Bw1--10 to 27 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) loam; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent, 30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.

    Bw2--27 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) loam; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, non sticky, non plastic, common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent, 29 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

TYPE LOCATION:  Millard County, Utah; about 1.5 miles northwest of the town of Fillmore, located 2,000 feet west, 1600 feet south of the northeast corner sec. 18, T. 21 S., R 4.; lat. 38 degrees 59 minutes 28.56 seconds N. and long. 112 degrees 20 minutes 27.56 seconds W., NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 51 to 54 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 65 to 74 degrees F.  The soil moisture regime is Xeric bordering on Aridic.

The particle size control section ranges from 18 to 27 percent clay.  Content of rock fragments is 0 to 15 percent. Reaction is moderately alkaline throughout the profile.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 2 through 4 moist, with chroma of 2 through 4.

The Bw and C horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, with chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is loam or silt loam, but averages more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  Reaction is moderately alkaline.  The Bw horizon doesn't meet the definition of a cambic horizon.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cessna soils are on stream terraces and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  The soil formed in alluvium derived from limestone and sandstone.  Elevation ranges from 4900 to 5300 feet.  The mean annual precipatation ranges from 12 to 14 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 49 to 52 degrees F.  Freeze-free period is about 100 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Beckstrand, Benstot, Deseret, Duggins, Heist and Kanosh soils.  Beckstrand soils have a mollic epipedon, are somewhat poorly drained, and have less than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Benstot soils have a mollic epipedon and are moderately well drained.  Deseret and Kanosh soils are influenced with gypsum and are somewhat poorly drained.  Duggins soils contain more than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Heist soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to very slow runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally for irrigated cropland, hayland and rangeland.  Potential vegetation consists of big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass and bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The Cessna soils are located in west central, Utah.  MLRA 28A.  The series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Millard County, Utah; Millard County, Eastern Part Soil Survey, 1995.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to about 10 inches (A1, A2 horizons)

Particle size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches. (A2, C1, C2 horizons)

Fluventic feature - it is assummed that there is 0.2 percent or more organic carbon at a depth of 125 cm below the surface.

The classification is based on the "Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eighth Edition, 1998".
