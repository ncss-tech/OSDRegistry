7/2017--The type location of this official series description was changed from Marion County, Oregon, in the NW1/4SE1/4 of section 6, T. 8 S., R. 2 W., to reflect more recent data and a more geographically central location. The competing series were updated also. The description was updated according to SSR01 Technical Note 11--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 11/2017). Most of the changes were in formatting. No major technical changes were made.
