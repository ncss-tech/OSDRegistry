COLLEGIATE SERIES

The Collegiate series consists of deep, poorly to somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium or glacial outwash.  These soils are on flood plains, low terraces, and old glacial outwash channels.  The mean annual precipitation is about 310 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Cumulic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Collegiate loam - grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 5 cm; an organic mat consisting primarily of undecomposed grass roots and remains.  (3 to 8 cm thick)

    A--5 to 28 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) light loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular or crumb structure; soft, very friable; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 36 cm thick)

    Ag--28 to 97 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) light loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist, many medium prominent mottles, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) moist and dark gray (5Y 4/1) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak granules; slightly hard, very friable, 10 percent gravel; noncalcareous; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (30 to 100 cm thick)

    2Cg--97 to 158 cm; noncalcareous very gravelly and cobbly sand.

TYPE LOCATION:  Chaffee County, Colorado; about 80 meters east and 65 meters north of the gate in the SW 1/4 of Sec. 26, T. 14 S., R. 78 W.; Buena Vista East Quadrangle; lat. 38 degrees, 47 minutes, 52 seconds N; long. 106 degrees, 4 minutes, 55 seconds W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Mollic epipedon thickness--60 to 100 cm; typically extending to the 2C horizon, but mottled Bw horizons of low chroma occur in some pedons.  
Depth to sandy-skeletal 2C horizon--60 to 100 cm
Collegiate soils are typically noncalcareous to depths of more than 150 cm; however, depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 100 to more than 150 cm in some pedons. 

Particle-size control section:
Texture of upper part--light loam or very fine sandy loam
Clay content--5 to 18 percent
Silt content--10 to 60 percent
Sand content--22 to 75 percent, with less than 50 percent fine or coarser sand
Rock fragment content--0 to 35 percent, typically less than 75 mm in diameter, but can range up to 250 mm in diameter
Reaction (pH)--6.6 to 7.8

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform--flood plains, low terraces, and old glacial outwash channels
Elevation--2275 to 2600 meters
Slope--0 to 6 percent
Parent material--alluvial or glacial outwash derived from various sources
Mean annual precipitation--280 to 380 mm, with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer
Mean annual air temperature--6 degrees C
Mean summer air temperature--16 degrees C

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly to somewhat poorly drained; low runoff; moderate permeability.  They have a permanent to fluctuating water table.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally as native pastureland or as native hay meadow.  Principal native vegetation is water-tolerant grasses and sedges.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Collegiate soils are moderately extensive in the high mountain valleys of central Colorado; MLRAs 48A and 49
