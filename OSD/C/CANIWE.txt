CANIWE SERIES

The Caniwe series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  These soils are on inset fans within mountain valley fans.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degree C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Duridic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Caniwe silt loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 10 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate thin platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to 15 cm thick)

    A2--10 to 23 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate thin platy; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.3); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 25 cm thick)

    A3--23 to 43 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 20 cm thick)

    2Cq1--43 to 74 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 40 percent 5 to 15 mm weakly cemented durinodes; slightly alkaline (pH7.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (15 to 30 cm thick)

    2Cq2--74 to 102 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 55 percent 5 to 15 mm weakly cemented durinodes; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.  (15 to 70 cm thick)

    3Ck--102 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam,  brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; very few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; common strongly effervescent fine carbonate seams and filaments; noneffervescent matrix; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Lander County, Nevada; approximately 35 miles south of Battle Mountain, about 600 feet north and 1,200 feet east of the southwest corner of section 8, T. 25 N., R. 46 E.; USGS Wood Spring Canyon 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; longitude 40 degrees 2 minutes 37 seconds N and latitude 116 degrees 49 minutes 48 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.0436111 latitude, -116.8300000 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in winter and spring, dry from late June through early October; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 25 to 48 cm.
Depth to Cq horizon: 36 to 66 cm.
Depth to carbonates: 76 to 117 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  20 to 35 percent.
Rock fragments:  Less than 5 percent.

A horizon
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.

Cq horizons
Value:  3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4.
Texture:  Stratified silt loam or silty clay loam, with thin
strata of clay loam or loam common in some pedons.
Reaction:  Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.
Durinodes:  25 to 60 percent weakly silica cemented in a very
friable or friable matrix.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Caniwe soils occur on inset fans within mountain valley fans.  These soils formed in loess and alluvium derived from mixed rock sources.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 1,770 to 2,075 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with hot, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 230 to 300 mm; mean annual temperature is 6 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Handy, Grina, Stampede, and Zoesta soils.  Handy and Zoesta soils have a fine textured particle-size control section.  Grina soils are shallow to a paralithic contact.  Stampede soils have a mollic epipedon and a fine textured particle-size control section over an indurated duripan.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow or medium runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Indian ricegrass, and bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Nevada.  These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28B.
