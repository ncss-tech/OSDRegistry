CRAIGEN SERIES

The Craigen series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils formed in sandy alluvium derived from strand plain deposits of the Beaumont Formation. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1473 mm (58 in).

Glossic horizon-81 to 203 cm (24 to 80 in) (Bt/E1,2,3, Btg/E1,2 horizons).

Additional Comments: The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data number S93TX-245-003 from Jefferson County, Texas. The redox features are considered both relic and contemporary and occur during abnormally wet conditions.
