COBEY SERIES

The Cobey series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over glacial till on foothills and mountains. Slopes are 8 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy, glassy, frigid Humic Vitrixerands

TYPICAL PEDON: Cobey silt loam, in forestland (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

 A1--0 to 5 inches, black (10YR 2/1) ashy silt loam, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; moderate fine granular structure; soft, friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; many fine, medium, and coarse roots; few fine gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 8 inches thick)

 A2--5 to 11 inches, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) ashy silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common fine and medium roots; few fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick)

 A3--11 to 15 inches, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) ashy silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common fine and medium roots; few fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 8 inches thick)

 AB--15 to 26 inches, dark brown (10YR 3/3) ashy silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common medium roots; few fine tubular pores; 8 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 14 inches thick)

 Bw--26 to 42 inches, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) ashy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common medium roots; few fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (12 to 18 inches thick)

 2C--42 to 48 inches, brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly fine sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic; common medium roots; few fine tubular pores; 50 percent cobbles and gravel; neutral (pH 6.6).

Parent material: Volcanic ash over glacial till
Mean annual precipitation: 18 to 24 inches
Mean annual air temperature: 44 degrees F
Frost-free period: 90 to 120 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:

Merkley (ID) is loamy-skeletal; has an ochric epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well-drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderate permeability

USE AND VEGETATION: Cobey soils are used mainly for woodland. The potential native vegetation is mainly ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, western larch, and lodgepole pine with an understory of willow, strawberry, Idaho fescue, pinegrass, and common snowberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Cobey soils are of moderate extent in northeastern Washington.
