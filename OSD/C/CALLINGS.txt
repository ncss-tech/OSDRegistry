CALLINGS SERIES

The Callings series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium, residuum, and glacial till derived from intermediate volcanic materials.  Slopes range from 1 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 18 to 35 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 34 to 40 degrees F.

TYPE LOCATION:  Garfield County, Utah; Winnemucca Flats; center of sec.  6, T. 32 S., R. 3 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is about 37 to 42 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 50 to 55 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick. The depth of bedrock ranges from 6 to 10 feet.  The rock fragments average 35 to 60 percent in the argillic horizons.  The solum is medium acid to mildly alkaline.

The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 dry, 1 to 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.

The E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist,  and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, gravelly fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, gravelly and cobbly loam.

The upper part of the B horizon has hue of 2,5YR, 5YR or 7.5YR (usually 5YR), value of 4 to 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist.  It is very gravelly and very cobbly clay loam or very gravelly and very cobbly clay.

The lower B and C horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry and moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  They range from extremely gravelly and extremely cobbly loam to extremely gravelly and extremely cobbly clay loam or clay.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Sunshine (CO) series.  Sunshine soils have a fragmental substratum with interstices 1 to 2 inches wide between the rocks not filled with fines and have stony clay argillic horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Callings soils are on convex hillsides, ridgetops and gently rolling to steep mountain tops and sideslopes at elevations of 9,300 to 10,500 feet.  In Colorado elevation is as low as 7,500 feet.   Slope gradients are 1 to 65 percent.  The soils formed in glacial till,  alluvium and residuum from intermediate volcanic materials, The average annual precipitation is 18 to 35 inches and the freeze-free period ranges from 50 to 60 days.  The mean annual air temperature is 34 to 40 degrees F. and the average summer temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Behanin and Ess soils.  Behanin and Ess soils have less than 35 percent clay in the B horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Timber, grazing by livestock and wildlife; Native vegetation is aspen, creeping juniper, mountain brome, slender wheatgrass; subalpine needlegrass, vetch, holly, and widely spaced fir and spruce.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  These soils are on the Sevier Plateau in the south central part of Utah and Western Colorado.  They are inextensive to moderately extensive.  MLRA 47 and 48A.
