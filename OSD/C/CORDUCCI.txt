CORDUCCI SERIES

The Corducci series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sedimentary and igneous sources. Corducci soils are on alluvial fans, low stream terraces and floodplains. Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 382 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 15 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, thermic Typic Xeropsamments

TYPICAL PEDON: Corducci, on a 2 percent slope at an elevation of 118 meters (387 feet). When described the soil was moist throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

  A--0 to 13 centimeters; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3), moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (7 to 21 cm thick)

  C1--13 to 90 centimeters; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy, dark brown (10YR 3/3), moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine roots; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. 

  C2--90 to 115 centimeters; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. 

  C3--115 to 200 centimeters; pale brown (10YR 6/3) coarse sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3), moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; 2 percent fine and 3 percent medium and coarse gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0). 

TYPE LOCATION: Monterey County, California, along Arroyo Seco River, 14 kilometers east of Greenfield, California. 330 meters south west of Arroyo Seco Road. 36 degrees North latitude, 16 minutes, 2.54 seconds and 121 degrees, 20 minutes, 21.1 seconds West longitude, WGS84 - U.S.G.S Quad: Van Nuys. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil moisture: The soil becomes moist below a depth of about 30 centimeters some time from October to December and remains moist in some part between depths of about 30 to 90 centimeters until April or May. 
Mean annual soil temperature: 16 to 18 degrees C. The soil temperature usually does not go below 8 degrees C. 

Textures in the particle size control section: coarse sand, sand, fine sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sandy; thin strata with silt sized particles are lacking. 
Rock fragments: dominantly 0 to 15 percent throughout; individual horizons may have up to 35 percent fragments. 
Reaction: slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline. 

A horizons: 
Dry color: hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 2 or 3 
Moist color: hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, chroma of 2 or 3 
Texture: fine sand, sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy fine sand fine sandy loam or loam. Some pedons have gravelly texture modifiers. 

C horizons: 
Dry color: hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, chroma of 2 or 3 
Moist color: hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 2 to 5, chroma of 2 or 3 
Texture: coarse sand, sand, fine sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sandy. Some pedons have gravelly texture modifier. 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Abaft, Arnold, Briones, Corralitos, Delhi, Monoridge, Monvero, Toags and Tujunga soils. 
Abaft soil: are found on stabilized sand dunes or beaches and are excessively drained. 
Arnold soils: have a paralithic contact at a depth of 100 to 150 cm. 
Briones soils: have a paralithic contact at a depth of 50 to 100 cm. 
Corralitos soils: are formed in materials weathered from acid sandstones and are not restricted to fluvial systems. 
Delhi soils: have less than 35 percent coarse and very coarse sand and are on wind modified ed surfaces. 
Monoridge soils: have a paralithic contact at a depth of 50 to 100 cm. 
Monvero soils: are formed in eolian deposits on dune fields on mountains from calcareous sandstone. 
Toags soil: have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section. 
Tujunga soil: greater than 35 percent combined medium to very coarse sand in the control section and formed in alluvium from granitic sources. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Setting: alluvial fans and floodplains on alluvial pains and valleys
Slopes: 0 to 9 percent. 
Parent materials: mixed alluvium weathered from sedimentary and igneous sources. 
Elevation: 21 to 756 meters. 
Mean annual precipitation: 226 to 609 millimeters. 
The mean annual temperature: 14.4 to 16.2 degrees C. 
Frost free season: 219 to 346 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Corralitos, Elder, Metz, Mocho and Tujunga soils. 
Corralitos soils: are on similar landscape positions and formed in alluvium from acid sandstone. 
Elder soils: have an irregular decrease in organic carbon and occur on similar landscape positions. 
Metz soils: are derived from sedimentary sources, have thin lenses of loamy material and occur on floodplains. 
Mocho soils: are on similar landscape positions, have mollic epipedons and are fine loamy
Tujunga soils: are on similar landscape positions, and have greater than 35 percent combined medium to very coarse sand in the control section and formed in alluvium from granitic source. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat excessively drained; negligible to low runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity. Flooding is none to occasional. 

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat and watershed. Native vegetation is shrubs, annual grasses and forbs and scattered willow, cottonwood and sycamore trees. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central California coastal valleys in MLRA 14. These soils are of moderate extent.
