CARACARA SERIES

The Caracara series consists of moderately deep to a hardpan, well drained soils that formed in mixed fan alluvium from conglomerate.  Caracara soils are on pediments and hills.  Slopes are 3 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 68 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic Argic Petrocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Caracara extremely gravelly sandy loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 1 inch; brown (7.5YR 4/4) extremely gravelly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak thin platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; 65 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 5 inches thick)

    Bt--1 to 9 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) cobbly sandy clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; many distinct reddish brown (5YR 4/4) continuous clay films on rock fragments; 20 percent cobble and 10 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick)

    Btk--9 to 19 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) extremely gravelly clay, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; strong fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; many distinct continuous clay films and calcium carbonate coatings on rock fragments; 5 percent cobble and 65 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (5 to 15 inches thick)

    Bk--19 to 32 inches; mixed light brown (7.5YR 6/4) and white (7.5YR 8/1) very gravelly sandy clay loam, yellowish red (5YR 5/6) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; common fine roots; common very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; many distinct continuous calcium carbonate coatings on rock fragments; common fine and medium hard irregular calcium carbonate masses; 50 percent gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick)

    Bkm--32 to 40 inches; massive; indurated petrocalcic; violently effervescent. (6 to 20 inches thick)

    R--40 inches; conglomerate.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Nahda (AZ) series.  Nahda soils do not have bedrock below the petrocalcic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Caracara soils are on pediments and hills.  Slopes range from 3 to 25 percent.  These soils formed in fan alluvium from mixed sources but dominantly derived from conglomerate.  Elevation ranges from 2000 to 3500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 67 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 240 to 260 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Delthorny, Vado, Arizo, and Stagecoach soils.  Vado, Arizo, and Stagecoach soils are very deep.  Delthorny soils do not have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Caracara soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation includes triangle bursage, paloverde, ocotillo, cacti, curly-mesquite, slender grama, bush muhly, threeawn, slender janusia, false mesquite and jojoba.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Arizona.  This series is of moderate extent.  MLRA is 40.
