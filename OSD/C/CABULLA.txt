CABULLA SERIES

The Cabulla series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and/or colluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Cabulla soils are on escarpments, ledges, and structural benches.  Slopes range from 3 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 27 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Lithic Ustic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cabulla cobbly fine sandy loam, on a west facing, convex, 25 percent slope in pinyon-juniper woodland at an elevation of 1,890 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The surface is covered by 2 percent basalt stones.

      A--0 to 8 cm; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) cobbly fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4), moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common medium, fine and very fine roots; 1 percent stones, 10 percent cobbles, 15 percent gravel; very slightly effervescent (6 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are finely disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 10 cm thick)

   C--8 to 20 cm; reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) channery fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4), moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common medium, fine and very fine roots; 2 percent cobbles, 15 percent channers; strongly effervescent (10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are finely disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary.

    R--20 to 30 cm; indurated calcareous sandstone bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bigmon (T)(CO), Hideout (UT), Lazear (CO), Redspear (WY), Rizno (UT), Rizozo (NM), Skyvillage (NM), Travessilla (NM), Travson (WY), and Zukan (UT)series. 
Bigmon, Hideout, Lazear, Skyvillage, Travessilla, and Travson soils: have hue of 7.5YR or yellower in the C horizon.
Bigmon soils: have a paralithic contact above the lithic contact.
Lazear soils: have greater than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section
Redspear soils:  have less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser in the particle-size control section and soil moisture control section is affected by peak periods of precipitation in April, May and June

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium and/or colluvium derived from sandstone and shale; some areas have subrounded basalt volcanic bombs on the surface and in the soil matrix; bedrock includes the Summerville, Moenkopie and Entrada Formations
Landform:  escarpments, ledges, structural benches
Slopes:  3 to 40 percent
Elevation:  1,554 to 2,195 meters
Mean annual temperature:  7.2 to 10.0 degrees C.
Mean annual precipitation:  229 to 305 cm

Frost-free period:  120 to 160 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the McCarty, Sinbad, Skos and Strych series.  The McCarty soils have both a calcic and gypsic horizon and are deep over a paralithic contact with gypsiferous sedimentary rock on fans and pediments.  The Sinbad soils are shallow over a paralithic contact with gypsiferous sedimentary rock.  The Skos soils have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and are on escarpments intermixed with the Cabulla soils.  The very deep Strych soils have a calcic horizon and formed in colluvium and alluvium on bench escarpments.  All of these soils are under Utah juniper and pinyon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, moderate or moderately rapid permeability; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Existing vegetation includes Utah juniper, pinyon, black sage, Bigelow sage, Torrey's jointfir, galleta, Indian ricegrass, and salina wildrye.  Utah correlates this soil to Semidesert Shallow Sandy Loam (Utah Juniper-Pinyon) RO34XY239UT ecological site.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Utah, Warm Central Desertic Basins and Plateaus; LRR D, MLRA 34B; small extent; about 2,300 hectares (5,700 acres) in Sevier and Emery counties, Utah.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Sevier County, Utah, Emery Area, Utah, 2011.  Parts of Emery, Carbon, Grand, and Sevier soil survey area. The Ute Indians called Ferron Creek the Cabulla. This series was proposed as a warmer counterpart of the Rizno series.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 20 cm.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 0 to 20 cm.  (A and C horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 8 cm.  (A horizon)
Lithic contact:  The contact with calcareous sandstone at 20 cm.  (R horizon)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
