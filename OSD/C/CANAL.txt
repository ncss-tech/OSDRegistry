CANAL SERIES

The Canal series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in stratified silty and clayey glaciolacustrine deposits on lake plains and terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Lauer, Lieber, Taggart, Tiro, and Westboro series. Lauer, Lieber, Taggart, and Westboro soils are more than 127 cm (50 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Tiro soils have till in the lower part of the series control section and are not laminated or stratified.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Canal soils are on lake plains and terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in stratified silty and clayey glaciolacustrine deposits. Climate is humid and temperate. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 1067 mm (32 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 12 degrees C (48 to 54 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 178 days. Elevation is 265 to 277 meters (870 to 910 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Glenford, McGary, and Montgomery soils. The moderately well drained Glenford soils are on higher landscape positions. The somewhat poorly drained McGary soils are on nearby dissected slopes. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Montgomery soils are in shallow, wet depressions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm (0.5 to 1.5 feet) between November and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low. Permeability is slow. 
USE AND VEGETATION: Most of the Canal soils are cultivated. Principal crops are corn, oats, wheat, soybeans, and mixed hay. Some areas are still wooded. Red maple, beech, red oak, pin oak, elm, and hickory are the main tree species. Native vegetation is hardwood forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South central Ohio; MLRA 111E. The series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Fairfield County, Ohio, 1998.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 23 cm (Ap horizon).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 23 to 91 cm (Btg, Bt horizons).
Aquic conditions: redoximorphic features present in all horizons below a depth of 23 cm.

These soils were previously mapped as Fitchville clayey substratum.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data are available for FA-36, the typical pedon, from the Soil Characterization Laboratory at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH. Additional data is available for the following profile: MD-21.
