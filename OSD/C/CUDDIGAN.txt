CUDDIGAN SERIES

The Cuddigan series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived from igneous and metamorphic rock. Cuddigan soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes are 3 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 457 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Cuddigan very fine sandy loam on a 6 percent slope in native range at an elevation of 2,530 meters. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 15 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/3) very fine sandy loam, very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/3) moist; weak fine and medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and non-plastic; many very fine and fine roots and common medium and coarse roots; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 60 cm thick)

    Bt1--15 to 53 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/3) very fine sandy loam, very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/3) moist; weak fine, medium and coarse subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots and few medium and coarse roots; few faint clay films on face of peds and on bottom of rock fragments; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 40 cm thick)

    Bt2--53 to 91 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/3) very fine sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots and few medium and coarse roots; few faint clay films on faces of peds and on bottom of rock fragments; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (30 to 70 cm)

    C--91 to 152 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/3) very fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and non-plastic; few fine and medium roots; 15 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8).
