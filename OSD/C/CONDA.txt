CONDA SERIES

The Conda series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in mineral spring deposits.  They are on low stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Coarse-loamy, carbonatic Cumulic Cryaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Conda loam, native cover (colors are for dry soil unless noted).

	A1--0 to 7 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate medium and fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; strongly effervescent total calcium carbonate 76 percent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

	A2--7 to 18 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate medium and fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; strongly effervescent total calcium carbonate 77 percent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

	A3--18 to 26 inches; gray (2.5Y 5/1) loam; very dark gray (2.5Y 3/1) moist; few medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist redox concentrations; moderate coarse granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; strongly effervescent total calcium carbonate 81 percent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

	Bw--26 to 34 inches; white (2.5Y 8/1) silty clay loam, gray (2.5Y 6/1) moist; few medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) redox concentrations; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; strongly effervescent total calcium carbonate 94 percent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (5 to 15 inches thick)

	BK--34 to 41 inches; white (2.5Y 8/1) loam, gray (2.5Y 6/1) moist; massive; hard, firm and brittle; slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; strongly effervescent total calcium carbonate 97 percent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (5 to 15 inches thick)

	C--41 to 60 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 8/4) sandy loam, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and irregular pores; strongly effervescent total calcium carbonate 99 percent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  Caribou County, Idaho; 600 feet south and 1,200 feet east from the center of section 21, T. 7 S., R. 42 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 35 to 43 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 45 to 55 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick.  The soils are frequently flooded for very long duration in April to June.  An apparent high water table is at 1.0 to 2.0 feet from April to June.  The A horizon has total calcium carbonate of 70 to 85 percent.  The total clay is 40 to 65 percent of which 35 to 40 percent is carbonate clay.

The B and C horizons have total calcium carbonate of 85 to 100 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Conda soils are on low stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevation is 5,600 to 6,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 16 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 40 to 47 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Lanark and Robin soils.  Lanark and Robin soils are well drained and are on adjacent mountain slopes and fans.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained, moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Pasture and meadow hay.  Native vegetation consists of redtop, tufted hairgrass, Nebraska sedge, lupine and silver sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Conda soils are inextensive.  MLRA 13.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Soda Springs-Bancroft Area, Idaho, 1925.

REMARKS:  The description was drafter in 1969 but was not entered into the OSED file until 2003.  The series was inactivated in 2003.  Range of Characteristics were derived from the SCS-SOI-5 dated 8/90 (ID8825).

The series was previously classified as fine-loamy, mixed, calcareous.  Based on laboratory data from Idaho, the soil ranges from 76 percent CaCO3 in the surface to 99 percent in the C horizon.  After removal of the carbonate clay, the remaining clay values in the A horizon are 9, 7, and 8 percent respectively thus the change to coarse-loamy particle-size class and carbonatic mineralogy.
