CLARESON SERIES

The Clareson series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from limestone.  These soils are on uplands.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1143 mm (45 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 14 degrees C (57 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Argiudolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Clareson stony silty clay loam, convex, 2 percent slope in native grass on a summit of an interfluve at an elevation of 290 meters (951 feet) above mean sea level.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   A--0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 inches); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) stony silty clay loam; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; hard, friable; many fine roots; 5 percent limestone flagstones and 15 percent limestone stones; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary. [15 to 30 centimeters (6 to 12 inches) thick]

   BA--20 to 36 cm (8 to 14 inches); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silty clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; hard, firm; common fine roots; 5 percent limestone channers; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary. [0 to 20 centimeters (0 to 8 inches) thick]

   Bt--36 to 64 cm (14 to 25 inches); dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) very flaggy silty clay, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm; few fine roots; few fine iron-manganese concretions; 15 percent limestone channers and 30 percent flagstones; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary. [15 to 43 centimeters (6 to 17 inches) thick]

   BC--64 to 76 cm (25 to 30 inches); dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) very flaggy silty clay, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm; common medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) iron-manganese masses; common small black concretions; flaggy limestone fragments comprise 55 percent of volume; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary. [0 to 30 centimeters (0 to 12 inches) thick]

   R--76 cm (30 inches); hard limestone bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Clareson soils are on uplands that have a convex surface.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in material weathered from hard limestone that is jointed and thinly bedded.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 940 to 1200 mm (37 to 47 inches).  Mean annual temperature ranges from 14 to 17 degrees C (57 to 63 degrees F).  Frost-free period is 175 to 255 days.  Elevation is 230 to 395 meters (755 to 1295 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Catoosa, Aliceville (Lula), Ringo, Sogn, Summit, and Zaar soils.  Catoosa, Aliceville (Lula), and Sogn are on similar topographic positions as Clareson soils.  Aliceville, Ringo and Summit are moderately well drained.  Sogn is somewhat excessively drained and Zaar is somewhat poorly drained or moderately well drained.  Ringo, Summit, and Zaar soils contain less than 15 percent coarse fragments and are below Clareson soils in the landscape.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained.  Potential for surface runoff is high to very high.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high (1 to 4 micrometers per second) in the surface and moderately low (0.4 to 1.4 micrometers per second) in the subsoil.  Permeability is moderately slow or slow.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Soils are mostly in native grass pasture.  Most common grasses are big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, indiangrass, and sideoats grama.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  MLRA 76, MLRA 84A, MLRA 112, and MLRA 116A in southeastern Kansas, southwestern Missouri and northwestern Arkansas.  The series is of large extent.
