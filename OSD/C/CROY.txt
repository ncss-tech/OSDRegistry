CROY SERIES

The Croy series consists of moderately deep over a hardpan, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in lake sediments derived from a mixture of rocks.  Croy soils are on lake terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Natric Durixeralfs
  Keys to Soil Taxonomy:  Eighth Edition, 1998

TYPICAL PEDON:  Croy loam, rangeland, in a slight depression. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 4 inches, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) when moist; weak, thin, platy structure that breaks to moderate, fine, granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; abundant medium roots; common fine pores; moderately calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary; horizon 2 to 4 inches thick.

    Btn1--4 to 10 inches, brown (7.5YR 5/2) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) when moist; weak prismatic structure that breaks to moderate, medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and slightly plastic; plentiful fine and medium roots; common fine pores; common thin clay films; moderately calcareous; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8) clear, smooth boundary; horizon 3 to 8 inches thick.

    Btn2--10 to 18 inches, brown (7.5YR 5/3) sandy clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) when moist; weak prismatic structure that breaks to moderate, medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; common fine and medium pores; common thin clay films; moderately calcareous; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.4); clear, wavy boundary; horizon 6 to 12 inches thick.

    Bk1--18 to 24 inches, brown (7.5YR 5/3) sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) when moist; weak, medium subangular blocky structure that breaks to weak, medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; common fine and medium pores; moderately calcareous; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.5); clear, wavy boundary; horizon 4 to 8 inches thick.

    Bk2--24 to 32 inches, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) when moist; single grain loose non-sticky and non-plastic; few medium roots; few fine pores; moderately calcareous; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.5); abrupt, smooth boundary; horizon 5 to 10 inches thick.

    Bqm--32 to 35 inches, light gray to gray (10YR 6/1) indurated hardpan, dark gray (10YR 4/1) when moist; moderately calcareous; few fine and medium pores.
