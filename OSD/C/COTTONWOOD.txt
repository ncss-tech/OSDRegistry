COTTONWOOD SERIES

The Cottonwood series consists of very shallow and shallow to gypsum bedrock, well drained soils that formed in loamy residuum overlying gypsum bedrock of Permian age. These very gently sloping to steep soils are on summits and side slopes of hills and ridges. Slope ranges from 1 to 45 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 16.7 degrees C (62 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 584 mm (23 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, thermic Lithic Ustorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Cottonwood silt loam, on a northeast facing, 3 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 503 m (1,650 ft).

R horizon 
This horizon consists of massive crystalline gypsum or alabaster bedrock 1.5 m to 5 m (5 to 15 ft) thick that is strongly to very strongly cemented. The gypsum is interbedded with reddish-brown mudstone and thin layers of dolomite and greenish-gray mudstone. The upper boundary of the R horizon is a lithic contact and is root restrictive. This material has very high to extremely high excavation difficulty.

COMPETING SERIES: 
There are no series in the same family. Similar soils are the Burson, Cornick, Harmon, Knoco, and Spikebox series. 
Burson soils: are very shallow to soft sandstone.
Cornick soils: have a mollic epipedon.
Harmon soils: are loamy-skeletal in the particle-size control section and have carbonatic mineralogy.
Knoco soils: are clayey in the particle-size control section and are formed from reddish-brown mudstone.
Spikebox soils: are formed from soft sandstone.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loamy residuum weatherd from and overlying massive gypsum bedrock, which is mostly alabaster, of the Blaine Formation of Permian age.
Landscape: Dissected plains
Landform: summits and side slopes of hills and ridges
Slope: ranges from 1 to 45 percent, but is mainly less than 20 percent

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
These are the Aspermont, Harmon, Knoco, La Casa, Nipsum, Quanah, Talpa, and Vinson series. 
Aspermont soils: are deep to Permian redbed sediments and are on slightly lower side slopes.
Harmon and Talpa soils: are formed from dolomite limestone on similar positions.

Vinson soils: have a mollic epipedon, are moderately deep to gypsum beds, and are on slightly lower side slopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage class: Well
Permeability class: Moderate in the solum and very slow to moderate in the gypsum bedrock
Runoff: low on less than 1 percent slopes, moderate on 1 to 5 percent slopes, and high on slopes more than 5 percent

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Used primarily for livestock grazing. Cover is sparse short grasses where grazing is continuous, but some tall grasses grow in protected areas. Where the soil is intermingled with deeper and more productive soils, small areas are cultivated.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas. 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: 
Childress County, Texas; 1910 in the Reconnaissance Survey of the Panhandle Region, Texas. 

REMARKS: 
The original series concept included soils that are shallow to a paralithic contact with massive gypsum bedrock and soils that have a gypsic horizon mapped in a complex with the Acme series. In 1999, the series concept was revised and restricted to shallow or very shallow to massive gypsum bedrock on upland positions. This revision retains the Cottonwood series with the largest acreage of these soils. The soils mapped in lacustrine sediments that have a gypsic horizon, on nearly level to very gently sloping positions, in a complex with Acme soils will be included with the Childress series. 

Edited 01/2017 (RFG-ROG): Updated competing series, geographic setting, and associated soils sections.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle size control section: 0 to 31 cm (0 to 12 in) (A horizons). 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 31 cm (0 to 12 in) (A horizons). 
Paralithic contact: The contact with weakly cemented gypsum bedrock is at 31 cm (12 in). (Cr horizon)
Lithic contact: The contact with strongly cemented gypsum bedrock is at 48 cm (19 in). (R horizon).
