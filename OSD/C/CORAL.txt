CORAL SERIES

The Coral series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in sandy loam till on till plains and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, semiactive, frigid Argic Endoaquods

TYPICAL PEDON: Coral fine sandy loam, on a 1 percent slope in a cultivated field on a till plain. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 20 cm (8 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) fine sandy loam; weak fine granular structure; friable; 2 percent gravel and cobbles; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [15 to 23 cm (6 to 9 inches) thick]

 E--20 to 30 cm (8 to 12 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam; weak medium granular structure; friable; 6 percent gravel and cobbles; moderately acid; abrupt irregular boundary. [2.5 to 13 cm (1 to 5 inches) thick]

 Bs--30 to 56 cm (12 to 22 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) sandy loam; weak coarse granular structure; friable; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; 4 percent gravel and cobbles; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. [8 to 25 cm (3 to 10 inches) thick]

 E'--56 to 69 cm (22 to 27 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam; weak coarse granular structure; friable; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; 1 percent gravel and cobbles; moderately acid; abrupt irregular boundary. [5 to 15 cm (2 to 6 inches) thick]

 Bt--69 to 122 cm (27 to 48 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) sandy clay loam; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; firm; common medium faint light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) masses of oxidized iron; common medium faint light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) iron depletions; 2 percent gravel and cobbles; moderately acid grading to slightly acid in the lower 8 cm (3 inches); abrupt irregular boundary. [46 to 76 cm (18 to 30 inches) thick]

 C--122 to 152 cm (48 to 60 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy loam; massive; friable; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) and brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) masses of oxidized iron; 6 percent gravel and cobbles; slightly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Osceola County, Michigan; 720 feet north and 200 feet east of the southwest corner of sec. 32, T. 19 N., R. 7 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Thickness of the solum: 91 to 140 cm (36 to 55 inches)
Rock fragment content: 1 to 14 percent gravel and cobbles throughout
Mean annual soil temperature: 6.7 to 8.3 degrees C (44 to 47 degrees F)

E horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR

Some pedons have a B/E or E/B horizon with the E part occurring as coatings on the surfaces of peds of the Bt part.

Bt horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: sandy loam or sandy clay loam
Reaction: strongly acid to slightly acid

C horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 5 or 6
Chroma: 2 or 3
Reaction: neutral to moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Charlevoix and Richter series. Charlevoix soils have an argillic horizon (Bt horizon) that is thinner than 46 cm (18 inches). Richter soils have stratified textures in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Coral soils are on till plains and moraines of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. The Coral soils formed in sandy loam till. The climate is continental. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 660 to 838 mm (26 to33 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 to 7.8 degrees C (43 to 46 degrees F). Mean summer temperature ranges from (61 to 66 degrees F). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The moderately well drained or well drained McBride soils and poorly drained Ensley soils form a drainage sequence with Coral soils. The well drained Montcalm soils and somewhat excessively drained Graycalm soils are common associates.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION: A large proportion is under cultivation. Small grains, legume-grass hay, corn, and navy beans are the principal crops. Other areas are in permanent pasture or woodland. Tree species include soft maple, elm, aspen, oak and swamp oak. 
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 94A, 98, and 99 in the northern half of the lower peninsula of Michigan. This series is of moderate extent.
