CAYO SERIES

The Cayo series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately rapid permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy sediments of Holocene and Pleistocene age.  These nearly level soils are in interdunes on the Sandsheet Prairie of the South Texas Coastal Plain.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm (26 in).

REMARKS:  Classification changed from Typic Ustochrepts to Typic Haplustepts based on application of the eighth edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy.  Classification changed from Typic Haplusteps to Typic Calciustepts based on application of the tenth edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 31 cm (0 to 12 in) (A horizons)
Cambic horizon: 31 to 38 cm(12 to 51 in) (Bk, Bknz, and 2Bknz3 horizons)
