REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon
*Ochric epipedon
*Particle-size control section--zone from the surface to a depth of 100 cm; zone from the surface to a depth of 81 cm classifies as medial (andic soil properties); zone from 81 to 100 cm classifies as clayey

9/1993-Classification changed from fine, mixed, nonacid, frigid Mollic Fluvaquents to medial over clayey, mixed, frigid Thaptic Endoaquands based on Amendment 16 of Soil Taxonomy.

1/1998-Classification revised to include amorphic mineralogy based on laboratory data from the associated Guler series (National Soil Survey Laboratory pedon number 87P064)

12/2005-The Conboy series was in the Klickitat County soil survey area until the boundary with the Yakima Indian Reservation soil survey area was changed in 2003.
