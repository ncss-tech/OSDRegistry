CANEADEA SERIES

The Caneadea series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, nearly level to strongly sloping soils on slackwater terraces of lake plains and valley floors of depressional landscapes. They formed in clayey Wisconsin age glaciolacustrine sediments. Permeability is very slow. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 914 millimeters, and the mean annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, illitic, mesic Aeric Endoaqualfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Caneadea silt loam, 3 percent slope, in a cultivated field. Elevation is 305 meters msl. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

TYPE LOCATION: Portage County, Ohio; about 4 miles southwest of Aurora, in Aurora Township, 1,500 feet east of the Summit County line and 200 feet south of Old Mill Road, T. 5 N., R. 9 W.; USGS Twinsburg, OH topographic quadrangle; Latitude 41 degrees, 17 minutes, 8 seconds N. and Longitude 81 degrees, 23 minutes, 13 seconds W., NAD 1927. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 100 to 150 centimeters. The control section averages between 35 and 60 percent clay, but typically is 42 to 60 percent. Stratification is usually evident within the series control section. The soils are typically free of rock fragments, but some pedons contain a few pebbles. 

The Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Some pedons have A horizons 3 to 4 inches thick with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Structure is weak to strong, fine to coarse, granular. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid. Areas that have been limed range to neutral. 

An E or BE horizon with redoximorphic features is present in some pedons. It has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium, subangular blocky. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid. 

The Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, or is neutral, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 0 to 6; chroma of 0 to 2 is restricted to the lower part. Texture commonly is silty clay or clay, and less commonly silty clay loam. Structure is weak to strong, fine to coarse, subangular or angular blocky, or medium to very coarse prismatic, or very thin to thick platy. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid in the upper part, and ranges to slightly alkaline in the lower part. 

The BC horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, or is neutral, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 0 to 6. Texture is silty clay or silty clay loam. Structure is weak or moderate, medium to very coarse, subangular blocky or prismatic, or very thin to thick platy. Reaction is slightly acid to moderately alkaline. 

The C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 0 to 4. Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay. Some pedons are stratified with thin layers of silt loam. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline. 

COMPETING SERIES: The Brockport, Churchville, Lockport, Odessa, Remsen, and Rhinebeck series are in the same family. Brockport and Lockport soils have bedrock within depths of 100 centimeters. Churchville soils have a lithologic discontinuity and 10 to 35 percent rock fragments in the series control section. Odessa soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the Bt horizon. Remsen soils formed in till and have a higher sand and rock fragment content in individual layers. Rhinebeck soils have sola less than 100 centimeters thick. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Caneadea soils are on plane or convex slopes on lake plains. The soils formed in calcareous, Wisconsin age, glaciolacustrine sediments. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Elevations are from 174 to 396 meters msl. The mean annual precipitation is 950 to 1200 millimeters. The mean annual air temperature is 7.1 to 10.5 degrees C. The frost free period is 130 to 195 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Canadice, Cardinal, Ellsworth, Fitchville, Geeburg, Glenford, Lorain, Mahoning, Remsen and Sebring soils. Caneadea soils are in a toposequence with the poorly drained Canadice soils, the moderately well drained Cardinal soils, and the very poorly drained Lorain soils. These soils typically occupy lower landscape positions and depressions. The moderately well drained Ellsworth and Geeburg soils and the somewhat poorly drained Mahoning and Remsen soils are on adjacent till plains. The moderately well drained Glenford soils, the somewhat poorly drained Fitchville soils and the poorly drained Sebring soils are medium textured soils associated soils on similar landscape positions. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is very low. Depth to an intermittent perched water table is 15 to 30 centimeters from November to May in most years. 

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used mainly for pasture or woodland. Some areas are in cropland with the major crops being corn, small grains and hay. The native vegetation was mixed hardwood forest with oaks, sugar maple, hickory and beech as principal species. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York. MLRA's 124, 139, and 140. The series is of moderate extent. 

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia. 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Livingston County, New York, 1908. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon - from a depth of 0 to 10 inches (Ap and BE horizon).
Aquic conditions - begin at a depth of 7 inches.
Argillic horizon - from a depth of 10 to 36 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Btg1 and Btg2 horizons). 

New surface runoff class names are used and are not comparable or the same definitions as the old names. 

It is anticipated that soils correlated as Caneadea in MLRA's other than MLRA 139, and on slopes greater than 15 percent, will be correlated as other series in future MLRA updates. 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data are available for the following profiles: PG-1 (the typical pedon), AB-49, AB-90, AB-94 and GA-S14. Samples analyzed by Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory, Columbus, Ohio.
