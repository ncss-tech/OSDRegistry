CALAMUS SERIES

The Calamus series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in sandy alluvium on valley flood plains. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (49 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 51 centimeters (20 inches).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Oxyaquic Ustifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Calamus loamy fine sand with a slope of less than 2 percent in rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless stated otherwise.)

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: sandy alluvium 
Landscape: valley
Landform: flood plain 
Slopes: 0 to 3 percent
Elevation: 610 to 1067 meters (2000 to 3500 feet)
Mean annual temperature: 8 to 12 degrees C (47 to 53 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 43 to 61 centimeters (17 to 24 inches)
Frost-free period: 120 to 150 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Almeria; Bolent; Fluvaquents, sandy; Inavale; and Ipage soils.
Almeria soils: are lower on the floodplain and are poorly and very poorly drained having a seasonal zone of saturation beginning at the surface and having ponding on the very poorly drained up to 15 centimeters (6 inches) 
Bolent soils: are slightly lower on the floodplain, and are somewhat poorly drained having a seasonal zone of saturation beginning at 46 centimeters (18 inches) Almeria soils are lower on the floodplain and are poorly and very poorly drained having a seasonal zone of saturation beginning at the surface 
Fluvaquents, sandy soils: are lowest on the floodplain and are very poorly drained having a seasonal zone of saturation beginning at the surface and having ponding up to 61 centimeters (24 inches)
Inavale soils: are higher on the floodplain and are excessively drained, not having a seasonal zone of saturation above 183 centimeters (72 inches) 
Ipage soils: are higher on a terrace, lack fluventic properties, and are moderately well drained having a seasonal zone of saturation beginning at 91 centimeters (36 inches)
 
DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage: Moderately well drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: very high
Runoff: negligible 
Seasonal zone of saturation: 91 to 183 centimeters (36 to 72 inches) 
Flooding frequency: rare, occasional on the channeled phase 
Flooding duration: very brief on the rarely flooded and brief on the occasionally flooded
 
USE AND VEGETATION: The major use is livestock grazing. A few areas are cultivated or hayed. The native plant community for the sandy lowland ecological site (R065XY029NE) is mostly sand bluestem, little bluestem, prairie sandreed, needle and thread, and switchgrass. Some areas are dominated by trees and shrubs. 
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North-central and southwest Nebraska. The Calamus series is mostly in LRR G, MLRA 65 and LRR H, MLRA 72 and 73. The series is of small extent.

OSD Modification
 
5/2002 RRZ: moved redox section, added concentration and depletion statement; Added 7.5 YR color to concentrations; added depletion of 2.5Y and reduced matrix statement; increased range of redox concentration and depletions from 20 to 40 to 80 inches; added competing series of Yaggy soils; Moved Ipage and Saxman to geographic associated soils; Sandy loam added to the A horizon; Fine sand texture added to C horizon.
12/2003 WAW: added fine sandy loam as texture in A horizon based on Roger Hammer's project Revision of Interdunal soils mapped on flood plains. Revised Geographically Associated Soils section. 
10/12/2006 RRH: TYPICAL PEDON: Changed C3 and C4 horizons to Cg1 and Cg2; RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: AC horizon added loamy sand; C and Cg horizons added 2.5Y hue, added loamy fine sand and loamy sand and gravelly coarse sand to matrix, and following strata added of finer textured material including mucky mineral and organic layers; COMPETING SERIES: revised. GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: revised and deleted Blackloup (associated with Boel & Barney), Loup, (interdunes of sandhills) Platte, Wann, Saxton (not associated with at type location) and added Fluvaquents, sandy (associated with at type location). DRAINAGE: corrected. USE AND VEGETATION: corrected.
