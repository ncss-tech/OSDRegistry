The Coburg soils are on high and low Winkle geomorphic surfaces as recognized in the Willamette Valley of Oregon. The soils associated with the low Winkle surfaces are subject to flooding.

2/2000--Classification changed from Pachic Ultic Argixerolls to Oxyaquic Argixerolls based on revision of Soil Taxonomy that included addition of the Oxyaquic subgroup.

8/2017--This official series description was updated according to SSR01 Technical Note 11--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 11/2017). Most of the changes were in formatting; some involved an update of competing series. No major technical changes were made.
