CRESENT SERIES

The Cresent series consists of very deep soils that formed in 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) of loamy sediments over sandy outwash on outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cresent soils are on outwash plains near the south and west edge of the Wisconsinan Age glacial moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent. Cresent soils formed in 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) of loamy sediments over sandy outwash. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8.9 to 11.1 degrees C (48 to 52 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 1016 mm (32 to 40 inches).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dakota, Dickinson, Onarga, Plainfield, Plano, Raddle, and Sparta soils. Dakota soils contain sandy textures within depths of 102 cm (40 inches). Dickinson, Onarga, Plainfield, and Sparta soils contain more sand in the upper part of the control section. Plano and Raddle soils contain less sand throughout the control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Soil moisture status wet is greater than 6 feet. Surface runoff is medium or high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/s) in the loamy sediments and high to very high (42.33 to 141.11 micrometers/s) in the underlying sandy outwash. Permeability is moderate in the loamy sediments and rapid in the underlying sandy outwash. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Soils are cultivated. Corn, soybeans, and small grains are the principal crops. Native vegetation is tall prairie grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central and northern Illinois, southwestern Wisconsin, and southeastern Minnesota. The extent is small in LRR M, MLRAs 105, 108B, and 115C.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: particle-size control section - the zone from 18 to 38 inches (46 to 97 cm); series control section - the zone from 0 to 152 cm (0 to 60 inches); mollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 46 cm (the surface to 18 inches) (Ap, A, and AB horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from 46 to 117 cm (18 to 46 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons). Udic moisture regime. Cation exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area. Taxonomic Version: Second Edition, 1999.

These soils were formerly correlated as a sandy substratum phase of the Jasper series.
