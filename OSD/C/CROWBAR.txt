CROWBAR SERIES

The Crowbar series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed fan alluvium. Crowbar soils are on fan terraces.  Slope ranges from 1 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic Aridic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Crowbar fine sandy loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 20 to 50 percent of the surface is covered with gravel.

	A--0 to 1 inch; brown (7.5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; moderate thick platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine vesicular and few tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; noneffervescent; moderately acid (pH 6.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick)

	Bt1--1 to 12 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) gravelly sandy clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; many very fine and fine tubular and common medium tubular pores; few patchy clay films on faces of peds and rock fragments; 25 percent gravel; noneffervescent; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt wavy boundary.

	Bt2--12 to 26 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/3) extremely gravelly sandy clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; moderate very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; common fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and rock fragments; 45 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 20 to 35 inches)

	2Bt--26 to 60 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) extremely gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and medium angular blocky structure; moderately hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic, few very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds and rock fragments; common distinct manganese coatings on faces of peds; common distinct organic coatings on faces of peds; 45 percent gravel and 20 percent cobble; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.0).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Crowbar soils are in the Chihuahuan desert on fan terraces at elevations of 4,600 to 6,200 feet.  Slope ranges from 1 to 15 percent.  These soils formed from mixed fan alluvium. The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December and January.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 62 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 160 to 210 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Terrarossa, Blacktail, and Cherrycow soils.  These soils have greater than 35 percent clay and less than 35 percent rock fragments.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation includes sideoats grama, plains lovegrass, green sprangletop, cane beardgrass, Arizona cottontop, blue grama, and black grama.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Arizona portion of the Chihuahuan desert. MLRA is 41. Crowbar soils are of moderate extent.
