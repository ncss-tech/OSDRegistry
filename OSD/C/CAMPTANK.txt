CAMPTANK SERIES

The Camptank series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks. Camptank soils are on escarpments of plateaus. Slopes are 15 to 45 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are currently no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Camptank soils are on escarpments of plateaus. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks such as welded tuff or basalt. Slopes are 15 to 45 percent. Elevations range from 1,465 to 1,650 meters. The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brace, Lonegrave, and Reallis soils. Brace soils are fine-loamy, moderately deep to duripans, and are on plateaus and hills. Lonegrave soils are loamy-skeletal, moderately deep to lithic contacts, and are on escarpments. Reallis soils are coarse-loamy, very deep, have cambic horizons and horizons with durinodes, and are on lake terraces. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; very high surface runoff; slow permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity in the upper part over moderately rapid permeability; high saturated hydraulic conductivity in the strongly contrasting lower part. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Camptank soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is mainly black sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, and Sandberg's bluegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Oregon. These soils are not extensive with about 250 acres of the series mapped to date. MLRA 23.
