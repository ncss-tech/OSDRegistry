TYPE LOCATION: Dare County, North Carolina; approximately 6,100 feet southeast of the base of the Oregon Inlet Bridge as it enters Rodanthe on NC Highway 12, 750 feet west of Highway 12 in a tidal marsh; USGS Oregon Inlet topographic quadrangle; latitude 35 degrees 45 minutes 12.85 seconds N. and longitude 75 degrees 30 minutes 48.68 seconds W. WGS84.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Solum Thickness ranges from 8 to 48 centimeters (3 to 19 inches)
Depth to Bedrock:  Greater than 200 cm (80 inches)
Soil Reaction: Moderately acid to moderately alkaline, throughout the profile.  Moist incubated soil reactions range from extremely acid to slightly alkaline.
Shell Fragments: 0 to 35 percent, by volume throughout with their shelly analogs.

RANGE OF INDIVIDUAL HORIZONS:
Oase, Oese, Oa, or Oe horizons (where present): 
Some pedons have organic horizons <20 cm in total thickness at the soil surface.

Texture--muck or mucky peat. 

Ase or A horizon:
Color--hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3. 
Texture--sandy loam, loamy sand, or sand with mucky analogs.

ACse or ACseg horizon (where present):
Color--hue of 10YR to 5GY or is neutral, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2. 
Texture--loamy sand or sand.

Cseg or Cg horizons:
Color--hue of 10YR to 5BG or is neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2. 
Texture--loamy sand or sand. In some pedons thin intermittent layers of clay loam, silty clay loam, or layers of shell are present.

Aseb or Ab horizons (where present):
Some pedons have buried surfaces within 200 cm of the modern soil surface.
Color--hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3. 
Texture--sandy loam, loamy sand, or sand. Some Aseb or Ab horizons have mucky modified textures. 

COMPETING SERIES:
Camocca soils--are slightly higher on the landscape with better drainage with less frequent flooding
Dello and Lang soils--are in floodplains and do not receive daily tidal flooding
Duckston and Osier soils--have siliceous mineralogy and are not flooded daily by tides.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape:  Coastal Plain
Landform: Back barrier island tidal marshes (Atlantic Coast)
Elevation: 0.3 meters below sea level to 1 meter
Parent Material: Sandy marine deposits (some locations do have a thin eolian sand deposits on the surface)
Frost Free Period: 200 to 270 days
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 14 to 21 degrees C. (58 to 70 degrees F.)
Mean Annual Precipitation: 1,143 to 1,524 millimeters (45 to 60 inches)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
Bohicket and Capers soils--have more than 35 percent clay throughout
Corolla soils--occur slightly higher on the landscape and do not contain sulfides within the particle size control section
Currituck soils--are on similar landscapes and contain thick organic soil materials
Fripp and Newhan soils--occur higher on the landscape, have very deep water tables, and do not contain sulfides

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage Class (Agricultural): Very poorly drained
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: High to very high
Internal Free Water Occurrence: Very shallow, 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 inches) continuously
Flooding: Very frequently flooding for extremely or very brief durations (daily high tides)

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major uses: Natural habitat for fish and shellfish production; a few areas are used for grazing and some areas have been diked and filled for use as water-front homesites. Dominant vegetation: Black needlerush, with lesser amounts of big cordgrass, and marsh hay. The needlerush vegetation often is immediately adjacent to the upland eolian sand dune areas on the Outer Banks.
