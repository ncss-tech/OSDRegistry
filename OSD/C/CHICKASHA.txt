CHICKASHA SERIES

The Chickasha series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone of Permian age.  These soils are on nearly level to sloping broad ridgetops and side slopes of convex hills in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A).  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 16.1 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 864 mm (34 in). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, thermic Udic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Chickasha loam--on 2 percent slope--in rangeland, at an elevation of 325 m (1065 ft) (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A--0 to 30 cm (0 to 12 in); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (Thickness of the A horizon is 18 to 41 cm [7 to 16 in])

     Bt1--30 to 61 cm (12 to 24 in); reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) sandy clay loam, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; hard, firm; thin clay films on faces of peds; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.  

     Bt2--61 to 112 cm (24 to 44 in); reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8) sandy clay loam, strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; hard, firm; thin clay films on faces of peds; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 25 to 102 cm [10 to 40 in])

     BC--112 to 147 cm (44 to 58 in); reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/8) sandy clay loam, reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; few coarse fragments of sandstone less than 3 inches in diameter in lower part; moderately acid; abrupt wavy boundary. (Thickness of the BC horizon is 0 to 51 cm [0 to 20 in])

     Cr--147 to 165 cm (58 to 65 in); light gray (10YR 7/2) weakly cemented sandstone; common medium distinct reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8) redoximorphic concentrations; hard when dry, slightly acid, can be augured when moist.

Navina, Teller and Teval soils: have a solum more than 152 cm (60 in) thick and do not have bedrock  
Stoneburg soils: have a solum less than 102 cm (40 in) thick 
Teval soils: have hues of 5YR or redder in the Bt horizon

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Coyle, Doolin, Grainola, Grant, Huska, Ironmound, Lucien, Mulhall, Renfrow and Zaneis series.   Coyle, Doolin, Huska, and Grant soils: are usually on landscapes above the Chickasha soils.  In addition, Doolin and Huska soils have a fine control section and have a natric horizon.  
Grainola and Renfrow soils: are on landscapes below the Chickasha soils.  In addition, these soils have a fine control section.
