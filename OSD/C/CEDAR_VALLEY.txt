CEDAR VALLEY SERIES

The Cedar Valley series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in sandy eolian deposits. These soils are on dunes on glacial lake plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 670 millimeters. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Oxyaquic Eutrudepts 

TYPICAL PEDON: Cedar Valley very fine sandy loam, on a convex slope of 3 percent, on a dune, on a glacial lake plain, in a cultivated field, at an elevation of about 400 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated).

    Ap--0 to 18 centimeters; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) very fine sandy loam, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) dry; moderate fine and medium granular structure; friable; many very fine and fine roots; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (10 to 23 centimeters thick)

    Bw1--18 to 74 centimeters; olive yellow (2.5Y 6/6) very fine sand; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to single grain; very friable; common very fine and fine roots; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary.

    Bw2--74 to 124 centimeters; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) very fine sand; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to single grain; very friable; few fine faint pale yellow (5Y 7/3) redoximorphic depletions and few fine distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) redoximorphic concentrations; neutral; clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bw horizon is 51 to 152 centimeters)

    Cg--124 to 203 centimeters; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) very fine sand; single grain; friable; few fine faint light gray (10YR 7/1) nodules of calcium carbonate; common fine distinct pale olive (5Y 6/4), many medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) and common fine and medium prominent yellow (10YR 7/8) redoximorphic concentrations; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) 88-Northern Minnesota Glacial Lake Basins; St. Louis County, Minnesota; about 11 miles northwest of Floodwood; located about 1800 feet south and 1700 feet west of the northeast corner of section 15, T. 53 N., R. 21 W.; USGS Toivola SW topographic quadrangle; latitude 47 degrees 4 minutes 46 seconds N., and longitude 92 degrees 58 minutes 49 seconds W., NAD 83.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--sandy eolian deposits
Landform--dunes on glacial lake plains
Slope--1 to 5 percent
Elevation--350 to 490 meters above sea level
Mean annual air temperature--3 to 5 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation--635 to 711 millimeters
Frost-free period--95 to 125 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Wawina, Cowhorn, Onega and Kapla soils. These soils formed in the same parent material as Cedar Valley soils and form a hydrosequence with the Cedar Valley soils.
Wawina--are on more convex positions
Cowhorn--are on less sloping positions and are lower in the landscape
Onega--are on flats  
Kapla--are in depressions

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--moderately well drained--these soils have a frequently saturated zone within a depth of 1 meter below the surface during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--4.23 to 141.14 micrometers per second 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cropped for hay. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Physiographic Division--Interior Plains or Laurentian Upland
Physiographic Province--Central Lowland Province or Superior Upland
MLRA--Northern Minnesota Glacial Lake Basins (88)
LRR--K; northern Minnesota
Extent--small
