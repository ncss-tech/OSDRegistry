CURTIS SIDING SERIES

The Curtis Siding series consists of somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in noncalcareous sandy alluvium containing a moderate amount of gravel. Curtis Siding soils are on alluvial fans and margin of terraces. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches. The mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, mesic Ustic Torripsamments

TYPICAL PEDON:  Curtis Siding gravelly loamy sand, rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A1--O to 8 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly loamy sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft, very friable; many very fine and fine, common medium roots; 20 percent gravel; mildly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual wavy boundary. (6 to 10 inches thick)

     C--8 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly loamy saint, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; single grained; loose; common very fine ant fine, few medium roots to 14 inches; few roots to 20 inches; 30 percent gravel; mildly alkaline (pH 7.7).

TYPE LOCATION:  Platte County, Wyoming; approximately 150 feet north of the road and 660 feet north of the railroad crossing in the SE1/4 of the SE1/4 of sec. 36, T.24N., R.68W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is about 49 degrees to 52 degrees F. The mean summer soil temperature is about 67 degrees to 74 degrees F. The control section is gravelly loamy sand or gravelly sand. Gravel is 15 to 35 percent.

The A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR; value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist; and chroma of 2 or 3. It is neutral or mildly alkaline.

The C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR. It is neutral or mildly alkaline .

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Dwyer, Mespun, Pinavetes, Tullock, Valent, and Wigton series. Dwyer soils are calcareous. Mespun soils have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR. Pinavetes, Valent and Wigton soils have less than 15 percent coarse fragments. Tullock soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Curtis Siding soils are on nearly level to moderately steep alluvial fans and margins of terraces. Slopes are O to 15 percent. The soils formed in noncalcareous sandy alluvium containing a moderate amount of gravel. Elevation is 4,200 to 5,200 feet. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 to 14 inches and occurs mainly in the winter and spring. The mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees to 51 degrees F. The mean summer temperature is about 65 degrees to 72 degrees F. The frost-free season is 120 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Larimer and Phiferson soils.  Larimer soils have argillic horizons. Phiferson soils are coarse-loamy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; slow runoff; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for range. The native vegetation is sand bluestem, green needlegrass, and snakeweed.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Wyoming. The series is of moderate extent.
