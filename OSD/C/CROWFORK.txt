CROWFORK SERIES

The Crowfork series consist of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in glacial outwash. These soils are on nearly level to moderately steep convex slopes on stream terraces and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 775 millimeters. Mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

(37 to 102 centimeters thick) 

 Bt and E--114 to 193 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 4/4) loamy sand (Bt); lamellae about 10 centimeters apart and 2 to 5 centimeters thick; weak medium subangular blocky structure; brown (10YR 5/3) sand (E); single grain; about 5 percent shale fragments; slightly acid; clear irregular boundary. (0 to 90 centimeters thick) 

 C--193 to 203 centimeters; brown (10YR 5/3) sand; single grain; loose; neutral.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--glacial outwash, Late Wisconsin age
Landform--nearly level to moderately steep convex slopes on stream terraces and outwash plains
Slope--1 to 35 percent
Elevation--200 to 400 meters above sea level
Mean annual air temperature--6 to 10 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation--585 to 965 millimeters
Frost-free period--145 to 205 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Biscay, Klossner, Litchfield, Medo, Muskego, and Suckercreek soils.
Biscay--are at lower landscape positions and are frequently saturated at the surface of the soil during the wettest periods of normal years
Klossner--are at lower landscape positions and have organic horizons 41 to 127 centimeters thick over loamy materials
Litchfield--are at lower landscape positions and have a frequently saturated zone at a depth of 0.75 meters during the wettest periods of normal years
Medo--are at lower landscape positions and have organic horizons 41 to 127 centimeters thick over sandy materials
Muskego--are at lower landscape positions and have organic horizons 41 to 127 centimeters thick over coprogenous materials
Suckercreek--are at lower landscape positions on flood plains and have carbonates in all parts between depths of 25 to 50 centimeters

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--excessively drained--these soils do not have a frequently saturated zone within a depth of 1.8 meters during the wettest periods of normal years
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--10.00 to 100.00 micrometers per second
Surface runoff potential--negligible to medium

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are cultivated. The principal crops are corn, soybeans, small grain, and hay. Some areas are in pasture and woodland. The native vegetation is tall grass prairie and mixed deciduous hardwood forest-mostly oaks. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Physiographic Division--Interior Plains
Physiographic Province--Central Lowland
Physiographic sections--Western lake section, Wisconsin driftless section and Dissected till plains
MLRAs--Central Iowa and Minnesota Till Prairies (103),
 Eastern Iowa and Minnesota Till Prairies (104), and
 Northern Mississippi Valley Loess Hills (105)
LRR M; south-central and southeastern Minnesota
Extent--small

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Wright County, Minnesota, 1998. 

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 51 to 101 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 193 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 28 centimeters;
argillic horizon--lamellae with combined thickness of 15 centimeters within a depth of 193 centimeters (E and Bt and Bt and E horizons);
udic moisture regime.

This soil was previously correlated as Rasset. However, this soil did not fit the proper classification of what is presently called Rasset. Also, most of the lamellae, identified previously as sandy loam and sandy clay loam, is now loamy sand or loamy fine sand due to reevaluation of texture of lamellae. 1/12/2011-TYPE LOCATION error corrected.
