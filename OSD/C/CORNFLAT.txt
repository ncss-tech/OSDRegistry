CORNFLAT SERIES

The Cornflat series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in marsh deposited alluvium derived from limestone. The Cornflat soils are on alluvial flats. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 125 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 17 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Cornflat soils are on alluvial flats. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. These soils formed in marsh deposited alluvium derived from limestone. Elevation is 880 to 935 meters (2,890 to 3,070 feet). The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 150 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is 16 to 18 degrees C. The frost free season is 230 to 300 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Bluepoint and Threelakes soils. Bluepoint soils are on sand dunes and are very deep. Threelake soils are on fan remnants over lacustrine sediments and have a loamy-skeletal control section. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very high runoff.The saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high above the bedrock, very low within the bedrock and moderately high below the bedrock. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly shadscale saltbush, creosote bush, and burrobush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southern Nevada, U.S.A.; MLRA 30. These soils are not extensive.
