CONNAH SERIES

The Connah series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till derived from glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on till plains.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, illitic, frigid Typic Haploxeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Connah silt loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

(15 to 25 cm thick)

    Bt/E--21 to 39 cm; B part (70 percent) is light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silty clay, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; E part (30 percent) is very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silty clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist that interfingers into the B part; color mixed is yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 5 percent cobbles, 5 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear wavy boundary.

(Combined thickness of Bt1, Bt2 horizons - 40 to 55 cm thick)

    Bk--90 to 123 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) silty clay, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; common fine soft threads and seams of lime; strongly effervescent; 5 percent cobbles, 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary.
