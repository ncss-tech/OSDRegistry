CABARTON SERIES

The Cabarton series consists of deep, poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium from acid igneous and basic igneous rock sources.  Cabarton soils are on low alluvial fans and drainageways and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic Typic Cryaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cabarton silty clay loam - meadow.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 12 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) silty clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; strong very fine and fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (10 to 14 inches thick)

    2C--12 to 16 inches; light gray (10YR 7/1) silt, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak thick platy structure parting to moderate fine granular; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine vesicular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 7 inches thick)

    3Agb--16 to 26 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay, black (N 2/) moist; strong medium prismatic and moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; coating of 2C material on peds; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual smooth boundary.  (10 to 25 inches)

    3Cg1--26 to 40 inches; gray (5Y 6/1) clay; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; coatings of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) and black (10YR 2/1) moist; massive or moderate medium angular blocky structure; very hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual smooth boundary.  (10 to 25 inches thick)

    3Cg2--40 to 60 inches; gray (5Y 6/1) clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; coatings of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2); massive or moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4 and 4/4) fine and medium mottles; neutral (pH 6.8).  (10 to 20 inches thick)

TYPE LOCATION:  Adams County, Idaho; about 1 mile south of New Meadows; about 2,590 feet south and 1,450 feet east of the northwest corner of section 25, T. 19 N., R. 1 E.

3Cg horizons

Value - 6 or 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist
Chroma - 1 or 2 dry and moist
Reaction - neutral or slightly acid
Texture - C, CL

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Saladon and Sawtelpeak series.  Saladon and Sawtelpeak soils lack ashy layers.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cabarton soils are on low alluvial fans and drainageways.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  The soils formed in mixed alluvium from acid igneous and basic igneous rocks.  Elevations are 3,800 to 5,200 feet.  The climate is humid continental, cool summers (Trewartha's modified Koppen system) with moist, cold winters and dry summers.  Average annual precipitation is 20 to 24 inches.  Average January temperature is 20 degrees F; average July temperature is 64 degrees F.  Mean annual temperature is 36 to 43 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 60 to 75 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Archabal, Blackwell, Gestrin, and Melton soils.  Archabal soils are well drained.  Blackwell soils have a moderately fine textured subsoil.  Gestrin soils are moderately well drained.  Melton soils formed in medium or moderately coarse textured glacial material.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; slow to medium runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for pasture, but drained areas are also used for hay, clover, and oats.  Vegetation is mainly sedges, rushes, redtop, and willows.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Distributed in the cold, high mountain valleys, mainly in Valley County, Idaho.  The soil is inextensive.
