CYGNET SERIES

The Cygnet series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are deep to dense till. They formed in loamy glaciolacustrine material 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) thick and in the underlying till. These soils are on beach ridges and longshore bars on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).

Williamstown soils have less than 27 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. No OSD on file for Vallonia series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cygnet soils are on low beach ridges and longshore bars on lake plains of late Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Cygnet soils formed in loamy glaciolacustrine material 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) thick and in the underlying till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 914 mm (27 to 36 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 165 days. Elevation is 183 to 244 meters (600 to 800 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aurand, Haskins, Hoytville, and Shawtown soils. The somewhat poorly drained Aurand soils are mainly on footslopes of beach ridges and longshore bars. The somewhat poorly drained Haskins soils are on slight rises. The very poorly drained Hoytville soils are on flats and in depressions on lake plains. The well drained Shawtown soils are on backslopes of more sloping beach ridges and longshore bars.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 30 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) between January and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part of the solum, moderately low in the lower part of the solum, and low in the dense till. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum, moderately slow or slow in the lower part of the solum, and slow or very slow in the dense till. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Cygnet soils are cultivated. Corn, soybeans, small grains and hay are the principal crops. A small proportion is in woodland. Native vegetation is deciduous forest, primarily ash, beech, elm, and maple.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Ohio and possibly eastern Indiana and southern Michigan; MLRA 99. The series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Hancock County, Ohio, 1997.

REMARKS: Cygnet soils are being converted from Haney and Digby soils during modernization projects in MLRA 99.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 30 cm (Ap1, Ap2 horizons).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 30 to 127 cm (Bt horizon).
Densic contact: at 142 cm (top of the 2Cd1 horizon).
Aquic conditions: redox features visible between the depths of 30 and 142 cm.

Supporting laboratory data is needed to confirm the presence of densic materials in the 2Cd horizon.

Representative DMU ID number is 129484.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory characterization data from The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory is available for AL-128, the typical pedon.
