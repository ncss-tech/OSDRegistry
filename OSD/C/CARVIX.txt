CARVIX SERIES

The Carvix series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Carvix soils are on high stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Haploxerolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Carvix silt loam--on a 2 percent slope at an elevation of 1,290 meters--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted) 

    A--0 to 15 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium and thick platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, many fine, and few medium roots; few very fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; disseminated lime on faces of peds; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 18 cm thick) 

    BA--15 to 48 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine, medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and few very fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 5 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary. (18 to 33 cm thick) 

    Bt1--48 to 99 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; few faint clay films lining pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (38 to 50 cm thick) 

     Bt2--99 to 152 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; few faint clay films lining pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6). 

TYPE LOCATION: Harney County, Oregon; about 0.5 miles north of Zoglmann Butte in Dick Miller Canyon; about 4,830 feet west and 1,800 feet south of the northeast corner of section 17, T. 23 S., R. 27 E.; USGS Riley 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 43 degrees 34 minutes 42 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 30 minutes 50 seconds W; NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: Usually moist from November through May, dry from June through October; aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric. 
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C. 
Mollic epipedon thickness: 25 to 50 cm; includes the BA horizon. 
Depth to base of cambic horizon: Greater than 150 cm. 
Depth to bedrock: Greater than 150 cm. 

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 18 to 30 percent. 
Rock fragments: 0 to 10 percent, mainly gravel. Lithology of fragments is volcanic rock such as basalt or tuff. 

A and BA horizons 
Chroma: 2 or 3 moist.
Reaction: Neutral througho moderately alkaline.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 2 percent
Salinity (EC):  0 to 2 mmhos/cm
Organic matter content: 1 or 2 percent. 

Bt1 and Bt2 horizons
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 2 through 4, dry or moist.
Texture: Loam or clay loam.
Reaction: Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.
Salinity (EC):  0 to 2 mmhos/cm
Other features: These horizons have a marginal clay increase that was considered insufficient for an argillic horizon. 

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Carvix soils are on high stream terraces adjacent to intermittent streams. These soils formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevation ranges from 1,220 to 1,650 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Carryback, Lonegrave, Lambring, Ninemile, Swalesilver, and Westbutte soils. Carryback soils are on adjacent uplands and are moderately deep to bedrock. Lonegrave soils are on steep south slopes and are moderately deep to bedrock. Lambring soils are on steep north slopes and are deep to bedrock. Ninemile soils are on adjacent uplands and are shallow to bedrock. Swalesilver soils are in depressions and are somewhat poorly drained. Westbutte soils are on steep north slopes and are moderately deep to bedrock. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low or medium surface runoff; moderate permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Carvix soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is basin wildrye, bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, basin big sagebrush, Thurber's needlegrass, and prairie junegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Oregon. These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 23.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Harney County, Oregon, 1997. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 48 cm (A and BA horizons). 
Cambic horizon - The zone from 48 to 152 cm that lacks sufficient clay increase for an argillic horizon (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons). 
Particle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Bt1 horizon and parts of the BA and Bt2 horizons).
