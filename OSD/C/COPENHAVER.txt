COPENHAVER SERIES

The Copenhaver series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from mixed rock sources.  These soils are on hills, mountains and ridges.  Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 36 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Lithic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Copenhaver gravelly loam, in grassland (colors are for dry unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 5 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots, many very fine pores; 25 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 7 inches thick)

    Bt--5 to 14 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) very gravelly clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots, many very fine and fine pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds and on coarse fragments; 40 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6) clear smooth boundary. (6 to 12 inches thick)

    R--14 inches; andesite bedrock.
