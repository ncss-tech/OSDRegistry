CLASOIL SERIES 

The Clasoil series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or outwash derived from granitic and other coarse grained igneous rocks.  These soils are on mountains, hills, fan remnants, alluvial fans, stream terraces and outwash fans.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 4.5 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Sawbuck and Sawicki soils. These soils are loamy-skeletal and are on similar landform positions. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderate permeability in the argillic horizon and moderately rapid below. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Clasoil soils are primarily used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The potential native vegetation is Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, rough fescue, Sandberg bluegrass, mountain big sagebrush, and rubber rabbitbrush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Clasoil soils are of limited extent in southwestern Montana. MLRAs 43B, 44B.
