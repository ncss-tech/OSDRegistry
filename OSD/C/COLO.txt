ADDITIONAL DATA:
Complete physical and chemical data on Colo soils is available in Dr. M. E. Collins' Ph.D. dissertation, Iowa State University Library, Ames, Iowa. Forty-seven profiles from Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, and Nebraska were sampled and described. This pedon from Tama County is identified in the study as Soil 86.
