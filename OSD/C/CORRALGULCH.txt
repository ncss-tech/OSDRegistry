CORRALGULCH SERIES

The Corralgulch series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or slope alluvium derived from igneous and metamorphic rock. These soils are on mountain slopes, structural benches and escarpments. Slopes are 8 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 8.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Argiustolls
