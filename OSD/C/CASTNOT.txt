COMPETING SERIES: This is the Kuzitrin and Tigaraha series in the same family.  Tigaraha soils are paramicaceous and both soils have a continental climate in the winter and a maritime climate in the summer, resulting in a mean summer soil temperature less than 2 degrees C. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: silty eolian deposits over gravelly colluvium and/or till
Landform: mountains
Slope: 20 to 65 percent 
Mean annual temperature: 25 degrees F (-4 degrees C)
Mean annual precipitation: 28 to 37 inches (712 to 940 mm)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Basaltlake, Minya, and Petrokov soils on similar landforms. Basaltlake soils contain more sand and are somewhat excessively drained. Minya soils have spodic horizons. Petrokov soils have mean summer soil temperatures above 40 degrees F. (5 degrees C.)
 
DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, high runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat and recreation.  The native vegetation is shrub birch-bog blueberry.
 
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 228, Interior Alaska Mountains, Alaska. The series is of small extent.
