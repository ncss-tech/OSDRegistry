CHACUACO SERIES

The Chacuaco series consists of moderately deep to sandtone bedrock, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in eolian sediments, slope alluvium, and residuum derived dominantly from sandstone and shale. Chacuaco soils are on ridges and interfluves of plains and on valley sides of plateaus. Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Calcidic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Chacuaco loam - range. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 5 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear smooth boundary (5 to 7 inches thick).

    AB--5 to 10 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granules; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); clear smooth boundary (0 to 5 inches thick).

    Bt--10 to 20 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common continuous distinct clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent pebbles; violently effervescent; few fine  masses of calcium carbonate; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary (10 to 18 inches thick).

    Bk--20 to 30 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) and very pale brown (10YR 8/4) very gravelly loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 30 percent pebbles, 10 percent sandstone channers; violently effervescent; 37 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); abrupt wavy boundary (3 to 10 inches thick).

    R--30 inches; very strongly cemented Dakota sandstone.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Asparas (NM), Capulin (NM) Rosebud (NE), Ryegate (CO) and Wapiti (CO) series.

Asparas soils:  deep to limestone bedrock.
Capulin soils: 40 to 60 inches deep to a lithic contact. 
Rosebud soils: paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.
Ryegate soils: 35 percent or more fine or coarser sand; deeper than 12 inches to secondary carbonates.
Wapiti soils: very deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: eolian sediments and residuum derived dominantly from sandstone. 
Landform: ridges and interfluves in the plains. 
Slope: 0 to 10 percent. 
Elevation: 5,000 to 8,000 feet. 
Mean annual precipitation: 14 to 16 inches.
Mean annual air temperature: 46 to 53 degrees F.
Frost free period: 120 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Capulin, Dalerose, and Torreon series. 
Capulin soils: greater than 40 inches to bedrock and are on slightly higher ridges and knolls. 
Dalerose soils: less than 20 inches to a lithic contact and are on summits and shoulders. 
Torreon soils: do not have bedrock above 60 inches, are in the fine family, and are on more gently sloping areas.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; runoff is negligible on slopes less than 5 percent and low on 5 to 10 percent slopes; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for livestock grazing. Principal native vegetation is blue grama, galleta, sideoats grama, and western wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Chacuaco soils occur in southeastern Colorado. LRR G, MLRA's 67 and 70. The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES PROPOSED: Las Animas County, Colorado, 1986. The name is from a major drainage in the area.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon: 0 to 10 inches. (A and AB horizons)
Argillic horizon: 10 to 20 inches. (Bt horizon)
Calcic horizon: 20 to 30 inches. (Bk horizon)
Lithic contact: bedrock at 30 inches. (top of R layer)

Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Tenth Edition, 2006.

The soil was previously mapped within the Ryegate soil, but was determined to average less than 45 percent fine and coarser sand in the particle size control section. This soil is pronounced Cha-kwock. Laboratory data S87CO-071-003.

The assignment of cation-exchange activity class is supported by lab samples S87CO-071-003.
