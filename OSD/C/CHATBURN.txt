CHATBURN SERIES

The Chatburn series consists of very deep, well drained soils that are formed in silty alluvium with some loess influence.  They are on coalesced fan terraces and valley floors.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes are 1 to 4 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the average annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Argixerolls

slope at 1,435 meters elevation.  When described on August 24, 1982 the soil was dry from the surface to 5 cm and moist below.  (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bancroft and Thatcher series.  All of
these soils lack Bkz horizons and platy structure in the subsoil.
Bancroft soils have secondary carbonate at 48 to 100 cm.  Thatcher soils have greater than 25 percent clay in horizons immediately below the Bt and have electrical conductivity of less than 2 mmhos below the Bt.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chatburn soils are on nearly level to gently
sloping coalesced fan terraces and valley floors.  Slopes range from 1
to 4 percent.  Elevation ranges from 1,405 to 1,495 meters.  The soil formed in silty alluvium with some loess influence.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 41 cm, the average annual air temperature is 6.1 to 7.2 degrees C., the frost free season is 85 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Downata, Heglar, and
Rexburg series.  Downata soils have a Pachic mollic epipedon, lack an argillic horizon and have a water table at 0 to 61 cm.  Heglar soils lack a mollic epipedon and an argillic horizon and are mesic. Rexburg soils lack an argillic horizon and platy structure in the
subsoil.  Downata soils are on floodplains and low stream terraces.
Heglar soils are on gently to strongly sloping south facing
hillsides.  Rexburg soils are on gently to strongly sloping east and
north facing slopes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained.  Slow runoff.  Moderately slow  saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Chatburn soils are used for irrigated crops, range
and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is Basin big sagebrush,
bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, and rabbitbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South central Idaho.  The soils of this series
is of small extent. MLRA 25.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Cassia County, Idaho, 1986.

REMARKS: This pedon was sampled by the NSSL, Lincoln, NB.  Sample
#S82ID-031:  The SAR exceeds 13 in the lower part of the argillic, but
does not qualify for a natric because it lacks prismatic structure or
tongues of E material.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 28 cm (Ap1 and Ap2 horizons).
Argillic horizon - The zone from 28 to 48 cm (Bt1 and Btz2
horizons).
Calcic horizon - The zone from 48 to 127 cm (Bkz1, Bkz2, and Bkz3
horizons).

Particle-size control section - The zone from 28 to 48 cm (Bt1 and
Btz2).

The superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.
