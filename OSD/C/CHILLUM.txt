TYPICAL PEDON:  Chillum silt loam, in a woodland. (Colors are for moist soil.)

     A--0 to 1 inch; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam; weak fine granular structure; friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic; many medium roots; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. (1 to 6 inches thick)

     E--1 inch  to 8 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam; weak fine granular structure; friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many medium roots; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick)

     Bt1--8 to 16 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) silt loam; very weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common roots; few faint clay films on peds; very strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.

     Bt2--16 to 28 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) silty clay loam; moderate fine, medium, and coarse subangular blocky structure; firm; moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few medium roots; many distinct clay films; very strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 15 to 40 inches.)

     2C1--28 to 32 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly sandy loam; common medium distinct brown (10YR 5/3) and yellowish red (5YR 4/6) mottles; massive; very firm; brittle; 20 percent, by volume rounded quartz pebbles; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.

     2C2--32 to 96 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly sandy loam; common medium distinct brown (10YR 5/3), dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) and yellowish red (5YR 4/6) mottles; massive; very firm; brittle; 65 percent, by volume rounded quartz pebbles; few thin seams of ironstone; very strongly acid.
