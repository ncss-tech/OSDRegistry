CHUBBS SERIES

The Chubbs series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Chubbs soils are on crests and side slopes of hills.  Slopes range from 5 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm (13 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 2.8 degrees C (37 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy, mixed, superactive Lithic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Chubbs sandy loam, on a south facing, 9 percent slope in grassland at an elevation of 2734 meters (8970 feet).  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  Described on September 26, 1984.

     A--0 to 10 cm (0 to 4 inches); reddish brown (5YR 4/3) sandy loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (6.1); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 15 cm thick)

     Bt--10 to 30 cm (4 to 12 inches); reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) gravelly sandy clay loam, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent gravel; neutral (6.8); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 30 cm thick)

     R--30 to 152 cm (12 to 60 inches); sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION:  Park County, Colorado; about 27 kilometers (17 miles) west of Guffey; located about 300 feet north and 500 feet east of the southwest corner of section 31, T. 15 S., R. 75 W. ; Gribbles Park USGS quad; lat. 38 degrees 41 minutes 43 seconds N. and long. 105 degrees 49 minutes 56 seconds W., NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture:  The soil moisture control section is usually dry in late spring and early summer, moist in some part in late July and August, and intermittently dry in fall; ustic regime bordering on aridic.
Mean annual soil temperature:  2.8 to 5.0 degrees C (37 to 41 degrees F)
Mean summer soil temperature:  10.6 to 14.4 degrees C (51 to 58 degrees F)
Depth to lithic contact:  25 to 51 cm to sandstone or shale (10 to 20 inches)

Thickness of the ochric epipedon:  10 to 15 cm (4 to 6 inches)
Lithology of rock fragments: sandstone

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Scotch and Silex series.  Scotch and Silex soils have a udic moisture regime. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  alluvium derived from sandstone and shale, commonly of the Pennsylvanian age Belden and Minturn Formations.
Landform:  on crests and side slopes of hills
Slopes:  5 to 20 percent
Elevation:  2621 to 2926 meters (8600 to 9600 feet)
Mean annual temperature:  1.7 to 3.9 degrees C (35 to 39 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation:  254 to 356 mm (10 to 14 inches)
Precipitation pattern:  Monthly precipitation is lowest in winter and greatest in July and August. 
Frost-free period:  50 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Glentivar series.  The Glentivar soils are deep and are on side slopes of hills.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, moderate permeability

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation consists mainly of Arizona fescue, Indian ricegrass, blue grama, mountain muhly, needleandthread, and western wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Colorado; LRR E, MLRA 48B; small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Park County, Colorado, Teller-Park soil survey area, Colorado, 2010.  The Chubbs series name was reactivated in 2009 for use in the Teller-Park soil survey. This series was originally established in 1959 in Chaffee County, Colorado, in the Trout Creek Watershed Area, which is now a part of the soil survey of Pike and San Isabel National Forests, Northern Part. The name is from a gulch in Chaffee County.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 30 cm.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 30 cm.  (the argillic horizon)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 10 cm.  (A horizon)
Argillic horizon:  The zone from 10 to 30 cm.  (Bt horizon)
Lithic contact:  The contact with sandstone at 30 cm.  (R layer)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

Taxonomic Version:  Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 11th Edition, 2010.
