COYANOSA SERIES

The Coyanosa series consists of very shallow to shallow, well drained soils that are moderately permeable above moderately slowly permeable sandstone bedrock.  These strongly sloping to very steep upland soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from sandstone bedrock.  Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, nonacid, thermic Lithic Ustic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Coyanosa very gravelly loam on a convex sideslope of hill of about 18 percent slope, in rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A1--0 to 4 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) very gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; common fine roots; 50 percent angular sandstone gravel mostly 1/8 to 3 inches in diameter; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)

     A2--4 to 10 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) extremely gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; common fine roots; 70 percent angular sandstone gravel mostly 1/8 to 3 inches in diameter; moderately alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 7 inches thick)

     R--10 to 60 inches; strongly cemented fractured sandstone bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Pecos County, Texas; from the Fort Stockton city limits on U. S. Highway 385, 30 miles south on U. S. Highway 385, to county road, then 14.45 miles east on a county road, to a private road, then 1.45 miles west on private road, and 225 feet south in rangeland. Latitude: 30 degrees, 19 minutes, 37 seconds North; Longitude: 102 degrees, 48 minutes, 03 seconds West.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July-September and December-February.  Driest during May and June. The soil is moist for less than 90 cumulative days during the growing season in the control section.  Ustic aridic soil moisture regime.

Depth to sandstone bedrock: 4 to 14 inches

Reaction: neutral to moderately alkaline

A horizon
Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR

R horizon
Strongly cemented fractured sandstone bedrock

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Lampshire (AZ), Lingua (TX), and Reduff (TX) series.  Reduff soils average more than 20 percent clay in the control section.  Lampshire soils are on igneous and metamorphic bedrocks and have 1 to 2 percent organic matter.  Lingua soils are on basalt bedrock and average more than 18 percent clay.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Coyanosa soils are on sloping to steep sandstone hills.  Slopes are mainly 5 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered predominantly from sandstone bedrock.  Outcrops of tilted, strongly cemented sandstone and large sandstone boulders are common.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 16 inches and mean annual air temperature ranges from 60 to 67 degrees F.  Frost-free period ranges from 210 to 275 days and elevation ranges form 2,900 to 5,200 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Boracho, Brewster, Ector, Hodgins, Reagan, Sanderson and Upton series.  Boracho and Upton soils have petrocalcic horizons and are in similar positions.  Brewster soils have mollic epipedons and formed in igneous bedrock in mountains at higher elevations.  Ector soils formed in limestone bedrock, have a mollic epipedon and are in similar positions.  Hodgins and Reagan soils are deeper than 80 inches and are on lower, broad alluvial flats.  Sanderson soils are deeper than 80 inches and are along lower narrow drainageways and on foot slopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is moderate above the moderately slowly permeable bedrock.  Runoff is low on 3 to 5 percent slopes, medium on slopes of 5 to 20 percent, and high on slopes greater than 20 percent.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for livestock grazing.  Native vegetation consists of lechuguilla, yucca, pricklypear, sotol, algerita, catclaw, javelinabush, cane bluestem, sideoats grama, plains bristlegrass, and black grama.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  West Texas. MLRA 42.  The series of minor extent.
