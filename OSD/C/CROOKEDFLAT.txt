CROOKEDFLAT SERIES

The Crookedflat series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and loess influenced slope alluvium. These soils are on hillslopes. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 525 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 2.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive Calcic Pachic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Crookedflat silt loam in rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A1--0 to 8 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky, slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt smooth boundary. 

    A2--8 to 33 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt wavy boundary. 

    Bt--33 to 41 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; strong medium angular blocky structure; moderately hard, friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 50 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. 

    Btk1--41 to 63 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; very few very fine roots; common very fine dendritic tubular pores; 20 percent faint clay films on all faces of peds; 5 percent fine threadlike calcium carbonate masses in the matrix; finely disseminated calcium carbonates throughout; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. 

    Btk2--63 to 105 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; strong coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; many very fine dendritic tubular pores; 10 percent faint clay films on all faces of peds; 10 percent fine threadlike calcium carbonate in the matrix; finely disseminated calcium carbonates throughout; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); gradual wavy boundary. 

    Bk--105 to 150 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common very fine tubular pores; 10 percent fine threadlike and irregular shaped calcium carbonate masses in the matrix; finely disseminated calcium carbonates throughout; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).
