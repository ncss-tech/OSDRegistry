CHIVERS SERIES

The Chivers series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly  drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rocks.  Chivers soils are in drainageways.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Oxyaquic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Chivers loam, on a east facing, linear, 3 percent slope in a riparian zone at an elevation of 7,750 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  

    A--0 to 4 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine, few medium roots; many very fine, common fine, few medium tubular pores; 5 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt1--4 to 9 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, few medium roots; common very fine and fine, few medium tubular pores; 5 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; few distinct clay films on ped faces; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.

    Bt2--9 to 14 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine, few fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; common prominent clay films on ped faces; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt wavy boundary.  (The combined thickness of the Bt horizon ranges from 10 to 12 inches)

    Bk1--14 to 25 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4); massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky and plastic; common very fine, few fine and medium roots; many very fine, common fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; strongly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated and segregated as common coarse irregular shaped masses; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.

    Bk2--25 to 45 inches; light reddish brown (2.5YR 6/4) gravelly sandy loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine, few fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated and segregated as common coarse irregular shaped masses; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.

    Bk3--45 to 51 inches; reddish brown (2.5YR 5/4) gravelly sandy loam, reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 25 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated and segregated as few fine irregular shaped masses; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary.

    Bk4--51 to 60 inches; pink (7.5YR 8/3) loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist; massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular and interstitial pores; violently effervescent, carbonates are disseminated and segregated as many coarse irregular shaped masses; common distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) redoximorphic concentrations; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Uintah County, Utah; about 2.5 miles west of Matt Warner Reservoir; located about 1,400 feet east and 1,400 feet south of the northwest corner of sec. 5, T.1S., R.23E.; Jackson Draw, Utah USGS quad; lat. 40 degrees 45 minutes 45 seconds N. and long. 109 degrees 21 minutes 50 seconds W., NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture:  The soil moisture control section is affected by precipitation that is evenly distributed throughout the year with a slight increase in late summer and fall.  Ustic moisture regime, Oxyaquic moisture subclass.
Mean annual soil temperature:  42 to 46 degrees F.
Mean annual summer soil temperature:  60 to 65 degrees F.
Depth to calcic horizon:  14 to 52 inches
Depth to redox concentrations: 40 to 51 inches
Thickness of the mollic epipedon:  9 to 14 inches
Depth to endosaturation:  1.5 to 3.5 feet during the months of January through December.

Particle-size control section (weighted average):  25 to 35 percent clay

A horizon:
Hue:  5YR or 7.5YR
Value:  3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma:  2 or 3 dry or moist

Bt horizon:
Hue:  5YR or 7.5YR
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma:  2 to 4 dry or moist
Rock fragments:  0 to 10 percent gravel and cobbles
Reaction:  slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline 

Bk horizon:
Hue:  2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  alluvium derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rocks
Landform:  drainageways
Slopes:  1 to 8 percent
Elevation: 7,400 to 8,000 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  40 to 43 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  16 to 22 inches
Frost-free period:  70 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cortyzack, Flynncove, and Namlot series.  Cortyzack and Flynncove soils are on mountain slopes and are well drained.  Namlot soils are on mountain slopes and have a lithic contact within 20 inches.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  somewhat poorly drained, low runoff, moderately slow permeability.  These soils are rarely flooded for brief periods during the months of April to June due to snow melt and run-in.

USE AND VEGETATION:  rangeland, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  Potential vegetation consists of bluegrass, western wheatgrass, prairie june grass, sedge, baltic rush, shrubby cinquefoil, Rock Mountain iris, and silver sagebrush.  This soil has been correlated to the Semiwet Fresh Meadow - 047CY004UT range site in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Utah.  LRR E, MLRA 47.  This series is of small extent.
