CINDERHURST SERIES

The Cinderhurst series consists of very shallow, well-drained soils that formed in volcanic tephra.  Cinderhurst soils are on basalt plains, and have slopes of 2 to 15 percent.  The permeability is moderate.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Medial-skeletal, amorphic, frigid Lithic Vitrixerands

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cinderhurst extremely cobbly medial silt loam - on a 3 percent slope at an elevation of 5,700 feet in rangeland.  When described on August 9, 1979, the soil was moist to 3 inches and dry below.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) extremely cobbly medial silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; about 50 percent cobbles and 15 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick)

    Bw--3 to 8 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very cobbly medial silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine medium and coarse roots; common very fine tubular pores; about 35 percent cobbles and 5 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4).  (0 to 9 inches thick)

    2R--8 inches; basalt with vertical fractures 0.5 to 2 cm wide (1 to 3 meters apart) with B material in cracks, few very fine, fine and medium roots in cracks.

TYPE LOCATION:  Blaine County, Idaho about 15 miles east and 6 miles north of Carey; 1,800 feet north and 50 feet west of the SE corner of sec. 19, T. 1 N., R. 24 E.  Latitude 43 degrees, 23 minutes, 04 seconds north; Longitude 113 degrees, 38 minutes, 15 seconds west.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cinderhurst soils are on recent basalt plains and associated with lava flows.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,600 to 6,000 feet.  The soil formed in wind deposited volcanic tephra.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches, most of which falls as snow and early spring rain.  The mean annual air temperature is about 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 60 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bancroft, Deerhorn, McCarey, Molyneux, and the Rehfield soils.  Bancroft, Molyneux, and Rehfield soils are very deep.  Deerhorn soils are moderately deep to a duripan and basalt bedrock.  McCarey soils are moderately deep to basalt bedrock.  All of these soils occur on much older basalt flows on basalt plains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Rapid runoff.  Moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for wildlife and limited rangeland.  Vegetation is mountain big sagebrush, lava fernbush, snowberry, bitterbrush, bluegrass and scattered limber pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Idaho.  This series is moderately extensive.
