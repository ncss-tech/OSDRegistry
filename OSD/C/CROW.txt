CROW SERIES 

The Crow series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and till from Tertiary age sediment.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, mountains, hills, and glacial moraines. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Lubrecht soils and the Bignell and Shooflin soils. Bignell soils are clayey-skeletal. Shooflin soils are very fine.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Crow soils are used for production of timber, woodland, wildlife habitat, and for grazing.  The native vegetation is coniferous forest consisting mainly of ponderosa pine, western larch, and Douglas fir with an understory of common snowberry, pinegrass, and dwarf huckleberry. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Crow soils are of small extent in western Montana.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation records:  MT0563.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 6 inches (Oi, E1 and E2 horizons); albic horizons from 2 to 6 inches (E1 and E2 horizons); an argillic horizon from a depth of 6 to 50 inches (Bt/E, Bt1 and Bt2 horizons); a particle-size control section that is the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon from 6 to 26 inches (Bt/E and part of the Bt1 horizon).  Crow soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on udic.
