CLARKSBUTTE SERIES

The Clarksbutte series consists of moderately deep over duripan, well drained soils that formed in mixed volcanic ash and loess over residuum weathered from basalt. Clarksbutte soils are on lava plateaus. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Vitrixerandic Argidurids

TYPICAL PEDON: Clarksbutte ashy silt loam, rangeland at an elevation of 1,320 meters. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The surface is partly covered by 10 percent cobbles.

(5 to 10 cm thick)

	Bt1--17 to 26 cm; dark brown (10YR 3/3) ashy clay, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium angular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common fine and many very fine interstitial pores; 40 percent distinct pressure faces; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 15 cm thick)

	Bt2--26 to 42 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong medium and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine interstitial pores; 10 percent distinct pressure faces and 20 percent distinct clay films on faces of peds and along surfaces of pores; 10 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 25 cm thick)

	Btk--42 to 54 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure, and weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; 10 percent faint clay films on faces of peds and along surfaces of pores; 10 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 20 cm thick)

	Bkqm1--54 to 70 cm; cemented material; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4); massive; very hard, very firm; moderately cemented by secondary silica and calcium carbonate; 10 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (10 to 20 cm thick)

	Bkqm2--70 to 90 cm; cemented material; massive; extremely hard, rigid; very strongly cemented by secondary silica and calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 25 cm thick)

	R--90 cm; indurated basalt

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Ochoco soils, which is greater than 150 cm to bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Clarksbutte soils are on lava plateaus. These soils are formed in mixed volcanic ash and loess over residuum weathered from basalt. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Elevations are 1,280 to 1,370 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 280 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bogusrim and Wisher soils. Bogusrim soils have greater than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon. Wisher soils are very deep and have a mollic epipedon. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained, slow to very slow permeability, moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeast Oregon; the soil is of large extent. MLRA 25.
