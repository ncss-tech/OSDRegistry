TYPICAL PEDON:  Chekika very gravelly loam on a low rise in cropland. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated)

    Ap--0 to 13 centimeters (0 to 5 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly loam, gray (10YR 6/1) dry; weak fine granular structure; very friable, soft; 45 percent by volume limestone fragments 75 mm or less in diameter; finely disseminated carbonates; strongly effervescent due to the presence of finely disseminated carbon or free carbon ; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt irregular boundary.  [5 to 25 centimeters (2 to 10 inches thick)]

Biscayne soils have bedrock at depths greater than 25 centimeters (10 inches), have less than 35 percent rock fragments, are poorly drained, and occur in lower landform positions.
Krome soils are better drained and occur on similar landform positions.
Pennsuco and Perrine soils have bedrock at depths greater than 51 centimeters (20 inches), lack rock fragments, are poorly drained, and occur on lower landform positions.
