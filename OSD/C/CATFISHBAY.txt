CATFISHBAY SERIES

The Catfishbay series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from igneous and metamorphic rock. The Catfishbay soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 75 millimeters (about 3 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 25 degrees C (77 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Growler (AZ) and Wellton (AZ) soils. Growler soils have salinity of 16 to 30 ds/m and sodium absorption ratio of 31 to over 90. Wellton soils have loamy very fine sand or finer soil textures throughout the lower part of the soil profile. Growler and Wellton soils have mean annual soil temperatures of less than 25 degrees C. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Catfishbay soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. These soils formed in alluvium derived from igneous and metamorphic rock. Elevation is 135 to 210 meters (about 440 to 690 feet). The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, dry winters. The mean annual precipitation is 50 to 100 millimeters (about 2 to 4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 23 to 27 degrees C (about 73 to 81 degrees F). The frost free season is 365 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Rizzo and Havasulake soils. The Rizzo soils are on inset fans and fan aprons, and have a sandy-skeletal particle-size control section. Havasulake soils are on fan remnants and have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; low to medium runoff; moderately high hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Catfishbay soils are used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and irrigated crops. Present vegetation is mainly creosote bush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Lower Colorado Desert of southeastern California, U.S.A.; MLRA 31. These soils are of small extent.
