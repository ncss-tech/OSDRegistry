CRANFILL SERIES

The Cranfill series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy calcareous colluvial sediments containing limestone gravel.  These soils are on foot slopes of ridges on hills. Slopes are dominantly 3 to 8 percent but range from 3 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 864 mm (34 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, carbonatic, thermic Udic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cranfill gravelly clay loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 25 cm(0 to 10 in); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; hard, friable; few fine pores; common fine roots; common films, threads, and concretions of calcium carbonate; 20 percent by volume of limestone fragments from 2 mm to 2.5 cm in diameter; about 80 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline, gradual smooth boundary.  (Thickness is 20 to 38 cm [8 to 15 in])

    Bk1--25 to 56 cm(10 to 22 in); very pale brown (10YR 7/4) gravelly clay loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; moderate medium granular and weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; few fine roots; few fine pores; many films, threads, and concretions of calcium carbonate; 26 percent by volume of limestone fragments from 2 mm to 4 cm in diameter; about 90 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (Thickness is 25 to 58 cm [10 to 23 in])

    Bk2--56 to 137 cm(22 to 54 in); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium granular and moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; few fine roots; few fine pores; many films, threads, and concretions of calcium carbonate; 31 percent by volume of limestone fragments from 2 mm to 4 cm in diameter; about 90 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (Thickness is 56 to 86 cm [22 to 34 in])

    BCk--137 to 203 cm (54 to 80 in); very pale brown (10YR 7/4) gravelly clay loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; many films, threads, and concretions of calcium carbonate; 20 percent by volume of limestone fragments from 2 mm to 4 cm in diameter; about 90 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline.
