COOLBRITH SERIES

The Coolbrith series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium from various sources. The Coolbrith soils are on toeslopes of alluvial fans. Slopes range from 1 to 10 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 535 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Oxyaquic Argixerolls

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Mulecreek series. Mulecreek soils lack sand textures in the subsoil.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Coolbrith soils are nearly level to gently sloping and are in margins of basins at elevations of 1,570 to 1,650 meters. They formed in alluvium from mixed sources. The climate is cool semiarid with moist cold winters and warm dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 360 to 650 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 8 to 9 degrees C. The frost free season is 95 to 115 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Beckwourth, Bidwell, Bieber, Correco, and Ramelli soils. Beckwourth soils have less than 18 percent clay in the argillic horizon. Bidwell soils have calcareous horizons at depths of less than 100 cm. Bieber soils have duripans at a depth of less than 50 cm. Correco and Ramelli soils have clay texture in the argillic horizon. Ramelli soils lack argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; moderately high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity, slow or very slow runoff.

USE AND VEGETATION: Coolbrith soils are used for growing hay, improved pasture, and alfalfa. The vegetation in uncultivated areas is silver sagebrush, perennial and annual grasses, and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern California in MLRA 26 (Carson Basin and Mountains). The soils are of small extent.
