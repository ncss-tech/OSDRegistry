SERIES ESTABLISHED: Boise Area, Idaho; 1901

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features in this pedon
*Mollic epipedon--zone from surface to a depth of 99 cm
*Cumulic feature--zone from surface to a depth of 80 cm; assumed irregular decrease in organic carbon content as depth increases
*Cambic horizon--zone from 99 to 137 cm; evidence of oriented clay but does not meet required criteria for clay increase
*Oxyaquic feature--saturated zone from 75 to 100 cm; aquic conditions; chroma of 2 or less with redoximorphic concentrations
*Particle-size control section--zone from 25 to 100 cm

1/22/2015--The official series description was updated as part of a soil data join recorrelation project. The updates include the following--
*Lowered reaction class by one class (moderately alkaline to slightly alkaline) for lower part of subsoil and for substratum in range in characteristics.
*Revised vegetation to include plants associated with LOAMY BOTTOM (R009XY402WA) ecological site.
*Revised "Geographic Setting" paragraph.

Further MLRA-wide investigation needed to--
*Determine degree and extent of influence of volcanic ash from Mount St. Helens, Glacier Peak, and Mount Mazama in loessal alluvium.
*Document depth and duration of apparent water table related to current ecological site assignment; original concept from 1975 for WET MEADOW ecological site that included rushes and cattails.
*Evaluate and document condition for higher reaction class (moderately alkaline) in range in characteristics for lower part of subsoil and in substratum in original 1975 concept.

6/2016--This official series description was updated as part of the final correlation of the Spokane County, Washington, soil survey. The formatting was updated according to SSR1 Technical Note 11--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015).
