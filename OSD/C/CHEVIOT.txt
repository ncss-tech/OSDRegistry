SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Douglas County, Washington; 1998

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon
*Mollic epipedon--zone from the surface to a depth of 43 cm
*Cambic horizon--zone from 43 to 81 cm
*Particle-size control section--zone from 25 to 100 cm

The Cheviot soils were included in the Kiona series in some older soil surveys.

The official type location has been moved from Kittitas County, Washington, to Douglas County, Washington, because the original pedon of the type location was not in a map unit of Cheviot soils. In addition, secondary carbonates were described as present above a depth of 112 cm.
