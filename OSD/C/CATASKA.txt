MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Monroe County, Tennessee; 1974. 

REMARKS:
The 3/99 revision updates classification to the 8th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy. The 4/00 revision represents the movement of the official type location from Monroe County, TN to Carter County, TN. 11/13 revision verifies classification --11th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy.  Note-mineral surface layers typically 3-5 inches thick

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
a. Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 13 cm, 0 to 5 inches  (Oi, A, BA horizons)
b. Cambic horizon--the zone from 13 to 48 cm, 5 to 19 inches  (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)
c. Paralithic contact--the occurrence of fractured, partially weathered bedrock at 48 cm (19 inches).
