CAMPANILE SERIES

The Campanile series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from shale. Campanile soils are on mesas and hills and have slopes of 1 to 6 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches. The mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Chromic Haplotorrerts

TYPICAL PEDON: Campanile clay - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)
 A1--0 to 2 inches; reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) clay, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate thin platy structure parting to strong very fine angular blocky; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; many pressure faces; many very fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent, lime disseminated; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick)
 A2--2 to 5 inches; reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) clay, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate thin platy structure parting to strong very fine angular blocky; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; many pressure faces; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 5 inches thick)
 ACss--5 to 32 inches; reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) clay, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) moist; strong coarse prismatic structure parting to strong medium and coarse angular blocky; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; many intersecting slickensides; slightly effervescent, lime disseminated; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 30 inches thick)
 Ckss--32 to 44 inches; reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) clay, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) moist; strong fine and medium angular blocky structure; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; few slickensides; many pressure faces; slightly effervescent, few fine lime filaments and threads; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 30 inches thick)
 Css--44 to 60 inches; reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) clay, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) moist; strong fine and medium subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; few slickensides; many pressure faces; slightly effervescent, lime disseminated; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).

TYPE LOCATION: Mohave County, Arizona; about 8 miles northeast of Moccasin; 800 feet north, 200 feet west of the southeast corner of Section 22, T. 41 N., R. 4 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture - Intermittently moist in some part of the moisture control section during July-September and December-March. Driest during May and June. Ustic aridic soil moisture regime.
Soil Temperature - 52 to 57 degrees F
Clay content -  35 to 60 percent
Cracks- 6 to 36 inches apart and 1/2 to 2 inches wide
Rock fragments - 0 to 5 percent gravel
Reaction - slightly to strongly alkaline
Intersecting slickensides - few to many

A and AC horizons
Hue: 2.5YR, 5YR
Value:  3 to5 dry, 3 to 5 moist. Moist values of 3 make up more than 50 percent of the upper 12 inches in the pedon.
Chroma:  2 to 4, dry or moist

C horizon
Hue: 2.5YR, 5YR
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Moriarty (NM) series. Moriarty soils are moist in the soil moisture control section during May and June. Moriarty soils are also located within MLRA 70 and LRR G.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Campanile soils are on hills and mesas. These soils formed in alluvium from shale. Slopes are 0 to 6 percent. Elevation is 4,800 to  6,600 feet. Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches. Mean annual air temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F. The frost-free period is 135 to 165 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Begay, Bidonia, Bond, Mespun, Padilla and Penistaja soils. Bidonia and Bond soils are shallow to bedrock. Mespun soils are sandy. Begay soils are coarse-loamy and Penistaja soils are fine-loamy. Padilla soils do not have vertic properties.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Campanile soils are used for livestock grazing. Present vegetation is western wheatgrass, black grama, blue grama, and big sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Arizona. The series is of small extent. MLRA 35.
