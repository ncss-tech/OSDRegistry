COLONVILLE SERIES

The Colonville series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy and sandy calcareous alluvium on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, active, calcareous, frigid Fluvaquentic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Colonville fine sandy loam, on an east-facing, concave, 1 percent slope in an area of permanent pasture on a flood plain. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 A1--0 to 25 cm (10 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) fine sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; friable; many fine roots; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.

 A2--25 to 43 cm (10 to 17 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) fine sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; friable; common fine roots; common medium faint grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. [Combined thickness of the A horizon is 28 to 61 cm (11 to 24 inches).]

 Bw--43 to 74 cm (17 to 29 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) fine sandy loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; many medium faint grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions; many medium faint brown (7.5YR 4/4) masses of oxidized iron; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.

 C1--74 to 96 cm (29 to 38 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sand; single grain; loose; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) organic staining; many medium distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions; many medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.

 C2--96 to 112 cm (38 to 44 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) sand; single grain; loose; common fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.

 C3--112 to 142 cm (44 to 56 inches); strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) sand; single grain; loose; common fine prominent brown (10YR 5/3) masses of oxidized iron; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.

 C4--142 to 152 cm (56 to 60 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sand; single grain; loose; 10 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Clare County, Michigan; 5 miles east and 1 mile north of Clare; 120 feet south and 1056 feet east of the northwest corner of sec. 27, T. 17 N., R. 3 W., Sheridan Township; USGS Loomis, Michigan 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; lat. 43 degrees 50 minutes 37 seconds N. and long. 84 degrees 39 minutes 46 seconds W., NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Thickness of the mollic epipedon: 28 to 61 cm (11 to 24 inches)
Particle-size control section: averages finer than loamy fine sand
Reaction: the upper 25 cm (10 inches) is neutral in some pedons; remainder of the profile ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline 

A horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 2, 2.5, or 3
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loam, very fine sandy loam, or silt loam
Redoximorphic features: distinct or prominent redoximorphic features are present in the lower part of the mollic epipedon

Bw horizon, where present:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 3 to 6
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam

C horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 3 to 6
Chroma: 2 to 6
Texture: very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or sand; strata of finer textures are below 127 cm (50 inches) are in some pedons
Rock fragment content: 0 to 15 percent 

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Colonville soils are on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The Colonville soils formed in loamy and sandy calcareous alluvium. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 889 mm (29 to 35 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 4.4 to 7.2 degrees C (40 to 45 degrees F). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Evart, Kawkawlin, Nester, and Sims soils. Evart soils are on similar topographic positions but have sand textured control sections. Kawkawlin, Nester, and Sims soils are fine textured and are on adjoining upland landscapes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Depth to the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from 30 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) between September and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high. Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION: Almost all areas are in forest or permanent pasture. Red maple, swamp white oak, northern white cedar, and quaking aspen are the principal trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 94A, 94C, and 98 in northern Michigan. The series is of small extent.
