COWD SERIES

The Cowd series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Cowd soils are on remnant terraces.  Slopes range from 8 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, smectitic Ustic Glossocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cowd loam, on a north facing, 9 percent slope in coniferous forest at an elevation of 9,000 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) Described on June 6, 1989.

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; slightly decomposed needles and twigs. (1 to 3 inches thick)

    E--2 to 9 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 8 inches thick)

    B/E--9 to 14 inches; 70 percent pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay (Bt), brown (10YR 5/3) moist; strong medium angular blocky structure; common faint clay films on faces of peds; extremely hard, firm, very sticky, very plastic; 30 percent light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam (E), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; many very fine and fine pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.1); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

    Bt1--14 to 20 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; strong medium angular blocky structure; extremely hard, firm, very sticky, very plastic; common very fine and fine pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary.

    Bt2--20 to 31 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; strong medium angular blocky structure; extremely hard, firm, very sticky, very plastic; few very fine and fine pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; 4 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.1); clear wavy boundary.

    Bt3--31 to 40 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky, very plastic;  few very fine and fine pores; many faint clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of Bt horizons is 30 to 40 inches)

    BC--40 to 50 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky, very plastic; few very fine and fine pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 12 inches thick)

    C--50 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; very hard, firm, very sticky, very plastic; few very fine and fine pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4)
