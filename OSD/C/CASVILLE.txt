MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Rockingham County, North Carolina, 2009.

REMARKS: Casville soils were previously mapped as Vance soils. The creation of a mesic region within the southern Piedmont necessitated a new series be established as a counterpart to the Vance Series. Casville is a small community in western Caswell County near the Rockingham County line.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 9 inches (Ap and BA horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 9 to 24 inches (Bt horizon)
Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches
