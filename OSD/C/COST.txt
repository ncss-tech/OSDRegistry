TYPE LOCATION: Gonzales County, Texas; from the intersection of U.S.  Highway 87 and Farm Road 1116 about 4 miles southeast of Smiley; 6.6 miles north on Farm Road 1116; 0.2 miles west; 1000 feet north in rangeland.  (Latitude: 29N, 19, 09; Longitude: 97W, 32, 38).

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTIC: Solum thickness ranges from 60 to 80 inches.  Electrical conductivity ranges from 12 to 35 dS/m throughout the pedon.  Exchangeable sodium percentage is more than 75 throughout the control section.  Sodium Absorption Ratio is more than 100 throughout the pedon.

Strongly contrasting particle size classes occur within the control section of these soils.  Weighted average clay content of the upper part of the particle size control section ranges from 35 to 50 percent.  Weighted average clay content of the lower part ranges from 5 to 25 percent.  Reaction ranges from moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.  The soil has aquic conditions in most years within 20 inches of the soil surface.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Clay content ranges from 4 to 15 percent.  Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sandy loam.  Iron and manganese accumulations range from none to few in shades of brown, red or yellow and iron depletions in shades of gray.

The Btnzg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less.  Texture is clay loam or clay with clay content ranging from 35 to 45 percent.  Iron accumulations in shades of brown, red, or yellow range from none to common.  Iron depletions range from none to few and are in shades of gray.  Iron-manganese in the form of stains and concretions range from none to common.  Calcium carbonate concretions range from none to few.  The horizon contains a few silica concretions.

The 2Bnzg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less.  Texture ranges from fine sand in the upper part to loam in thick, stratified layers.

Iron manganese and silica concretions range from none to common.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  Similar soils are the Brundage, Casa Grande, Crot, Dietrich, Gothard, Imogene, Orelia, Palobio, and Willamar series.  Brundage and Casa Grande soils are dry in the moisture control section for longer periods.  Crot and Gothard soils are in the thermic family.  Dietrich and Willamar soils have clay content of more than 20 percent throughout the subsoil.  Imogene soils have darker surfaces and less saturation with sodium in the upper 40 inches.  Orelia soils have Bt horizons that have less than 15 percent saturation with sodium.  Palobio soils have sola 60 to more than 80 inches and have less sodium saturation.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cost soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping low stream terraces.  Slopes are dominantly plain or slightly concave and are mostly less than 1 percent but range to 2 percent.  The soils formed in saline, stratified sandy and loamy sediments presumed to be alluvium of Pleistocene age.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 36 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 70 to 74 degrees F.  Frost free days ranges from 260 to 300 and elevation ranges from 200 to 500 feet.  Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 44 to 48.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Degola, Imogene and Meguin soils.  Degola and Meguin soils have a mollic epipedon and are on similar landscape positions.  Imogene soils have lower salinity levels and on slightly higher landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  Permeability is very slow.  Runoff is negligible on slopes less than 1 percent, and very low on slopes of 1 to 2 percent.  Flooding by stream overflow for brief duration may occur at intervals of 1 or more times a year.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used as rangeland. Native vegetation is salt flat grass, gulf cordgrass, salt lavender and alkali sacaton.  Woody invaders are mesquite, bushy sea-oxeye, and cactus.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: In the Northern Rio Grande Plain of Texas (83A).  The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES PROPOSED: Gonzales County, Texas, 1995.  The name is derived from a small town in Gonzales County.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - 0 to 3 inches (A horizon)

Natric Horizon - 3 to 30 inches (Btnzg horizons)

Redoximorphic features - From 3 to 80 inches

Aquic feature - Aquic conditions within 20 inches of the soil surface (reduced matrix {10YR 5/1 and 2.5Y 6/2, 7/2} from 9 to 80 inches, saturation, and reduction in most years; and redox concentrations within peds.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Particle size family and textures within horizons based on NSSL data (S93TX-177-005) using the following formula: Clay % = 2.5(% water retained at 1500 kPa tension - % organic carbon).
