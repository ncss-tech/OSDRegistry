COLDENT SERIES

The Coldent series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks with a component of volcanic ash.  Coldent soils are on alluvial flats and beach plains.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 130 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Beryl, Blimo, Bubus, Nyak, Okan, and Valmy series.

Beryl, Blimo, Nyak, and Okan soils have an aridic soil moisture regime that borders on xeric.  Bubus soils do not have horizons with firm, brittle matrix, have horizons with 20 to 70 percent durinodes, and have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 12 degrees C.  Valmy soils have subhorizons with 20 to 85 percent durinodes and have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 12 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Coldent soils are on alluvial flats and beach plains.  These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks with a component of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 1,160 to 1,310 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 150 mm, mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Isolde and Swingler soils. Isolde soils are sandy and occur on dunes.  Swingler soils are fine-silty.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high or very high surface runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Coldent soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly shadscale, bud sagebrush, Bailey greasewood, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 27.
