CEDARFLAT SERIES

The Cedarflat series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from serpentine. Cedarflat soils are on mountains and have slopes of 5 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1780 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, magnesic, thermic Pachic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Cedarflat gravelly loam on a northeast-facing slope of 40 percent under Idahoe fescue, California melicgrass, scattered Jeffrey pine and incense cedar, incense cedar seedlings, Indian's dream, and other grasses and forbs at an elevation of 720 meters. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.) When described on 4/18/2007 the soil was moist throughout.

 Cd2--120 to 200 cm; light greenish gray (10GY 7/1) and gray (N 5/0) very cobbly loam, dark gray (N 4/0) and  greenish gray (10GY 5/1); massive; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 20 percent paragravel, 20 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.8). (Combined thickness of the Cd horizons is 100 to 150 centimeters)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section, in normal years, is dry in all parts for 45 or more consecutive days in the 4 months following the summer solstice and moist in all parts for 45 or more consecutive days in the 4 months following the winter solstice. The soils have a xeric soil moisture regime.

Soil Temperature: The mean annual soil temperature at 50 centimeters is 15 to 16 degrees C and the difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 6 degrees or greater. The soils have a thermic soil temperature regime.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Bearvalley series.  Bearvalley soils do not have densic materials within 190 centimeters.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cedarflat soils are on convex positions on mountain slopes and ridges. Slopes are 5 to 50 percent. Elevations are 300 to 900 meters. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from serpentinite. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1500 to 2030 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is 13 to 15 degrees C. Frost free season is about 240 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Salmonfalls (CA) and Yorknorth (CA) soils. Salmonfalls soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section and are on convex positions. Yorknorth soils are not in the magnesic mineralogy class, have more than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section, and are on concave positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; high runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used mainly for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed. Natural vegetation includes Idahoe fescue, California melicgrass, scattered incense cedar and Jeffrey pine, prostrate ceanothus, Indian's dream, Tolmie star-tulip, creamcups, goldfields, blue dicks, and popcorn flower.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Siskiyou-Trinity Area, MLRA 5. The series is not extensive.
