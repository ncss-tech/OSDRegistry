CEDARPASS SERIES

The Cedarpass series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in sodium-enriched silty alluvium on uplands, terraces, and fan remnants. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Torrifluventic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Cedarpass silt loam, on a southwest-facing slope of 2 percent in native grass. When described the soil was moist to 8 cm. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 8 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; many fine and medium roots; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. (5 to 13 cm thick)

    Bw1--8 to 18 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) and pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) crushed; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak fine and medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; slightly effervescent; neutral; clear wavy boundary.

    Bw2--18 to 43 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bw horizon is 20 to 50 cm)

    C1--43 to 89 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

    C2--89 to 114 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) stratified silt loam, very fine sandy loam and silty clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

    C3--114 to 129 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) and very pale brown (10YR 8/3) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) and pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; thin bedding planes evident; hard, friable nonsticky and nonplastic; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

    C4--129 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) stratified silt loam and silty clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; hard, friable; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Jackson County, South Dakota; about 1 mile southeast of Interior; 460 feet north and 1,030 feet west of the southeast corner of Sec. 4, T.4S., R.18E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Depth to bedrock:  typically greater than 150 cm; weakly cemented claystone may occur between 100 and 150 cm in some pedons.  Depth to continuous accumulations of calcium carbonate:  0 to 25 cm

Particle-size control section (weighted average):  
Clay content:  18 to 30 percent
Sand content:  5 to 15 percent fine and coarser sand; 10 to 50 percent very fine sand
Sodium Adsorption Ratio:  10 to 30

A horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist 
Chroma: 1 to 3
Texture: VFSL, L, SIL, or SICL
Sodium Adsorption Ratio: 1 to 10
Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline

Bw horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y
Value: 5 to 8, 3 to 6 moist 
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: typically SIL, or SICL; less commonly VFSL or L

COMPETING SERIES:
There are no competing series in this taxonomic class.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: sodic alluvium derived primarily from White River formation sedimentary rock
Landform: uplands, terraces, and fan remnants
Slopes: 0 to 6 percent
Mean annual air temperature: 6 to 10 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation: 355 to 455 mm

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Denby, Interior and Whitewater soils.
Denby soils are fine textured.  They occur on similar landscape positions, usually in micro-lows.
Interior soils are less developed and more highly stratified than Cedarpass soils.   They occur on lower parts of the landscape where occasional and frequent flooding occurs.
Whitewater soils are fine textured and have bedrock between 50 and 100 cm.  They occur on higher parts of the landscape.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; moderately-high saturated hydraulic conductivity; low to medium runoff.

USE AND VEGETATION: Cedarpass is used primarily for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is western wheatgrass, green needlegrass, blue grama, buffalograss, sedges and forbs. Winter wheat, oats, and alfalfa are locally-grown crops.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Badlands pediment physiographic area of the Sandy and Silty Tablelands and Badlands of southwest South Dakota; LRR G, MLRA 64.  The Cedarpass series is of moderate extent.
