CETRACK SERIES

The Cetrack series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvium.  They have sands and gravel at moderate depths. These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, and glacial outwash plains.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cetrack loam, irrigated pasture (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 6 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; neutral (pH 7.1); abrupt smooth boundary. (4 to 6 inches thick)

    Bw--6 to 12 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 5 percent pebbles; few wormcasts; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); gradual smooth boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick)

    Bk1--12 to 16 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 5 percent pebbles; few medium threads and nodules of lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); gradual smooth boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

    Bk2--16 to 32 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 10 percent pebbles; many fine lime nodules; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 18 inches thick)

    2C--32 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly loamy sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 40 percent pebbles and 20 percent cobbles; common distinct lime coatings on rock fragments; strongly effervescent in upper part; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Powell, County, Montana, 1995.  Series proposed:  Upper Clark Fork River area, Montana, 1978.  

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations records:  MT0619, MT8130.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 12 inches (Ap, Bw horizon); accumulation of lime from 12 to 32 inches (Bk1, Bk2 horizons);  a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bw, Bk1, Bk2 horizons).  Cetrack soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
