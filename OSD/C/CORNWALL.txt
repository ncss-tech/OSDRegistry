CORNWALL SERIES

The Cornwall series consist of very deep, moderately well drained, soils that formed in loess or silty sediments and valley fill materials.  These soils are on high terraces, valley footslopes, sinkholes, and intravalley ridge points.  Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 44 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-silty, mixed, active, mesic Fragiaquic Paleudults

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cornwall silt loam - on the summit of an intravalley ridge point with 3 percent slope in fescue pasture at an elevation of 625 feet.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

  Bt--5 to 17 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) silty clay loam; weak fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; strongly acid (pH 5.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (12 to 23 inches thick)

  2Btx1--17 to 27 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) silt loam; weak very coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium platy and weak fine subangular blocky; firm; common fine roots in vertical pale brown seams; common medium and coarse prominent pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay depletions and common medium prominent yellowish red (5YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation along seam exteriors; common fine black masses of iron and manganese accumulation; few distinct clay films on faces of peds; 2 percent chert gravel; 30 percent brittleness; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); clear smooth boundary.

  2Btx2--27 to 39 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) silt loam; weak very coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; firm; many medium and coarse prominent light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) iron depletions and common medium and coarse prominent yellowish red (5YR 4/6) masses of iron accumulation along seam exteriors; common very fine black masses of iron and manganese accumulation; few distinct clay films on faces of peds; 2 percent chert gravel; 40 percent brittleness; strongly acid (pH 5.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the 2Btx horizon is 10 to 28 inches)

  3Bt--39 to 60 inches; red (2.5YR 4/6) very gravelly silty clay loam; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very firm; few medium prominent brown (10YR 5/3) iron depletions and few fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) masses of iron accumulation; common prominent clay films on ped faces; 42 percent chert gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.1).

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Sowcoon series. Sowcoon soils are somewhat poorly drained.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cornwall soils are on high terraces, valley footslopes, intravalley ridge points, and in sinkholes.  These soils formed in loess or silty sediments and loamy valley fill materials. Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 54 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 40 to 47 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Aslinger, Bearthicket, Britwater, Clarksville, Marquand, Roselle, and Tilk soils. Aslinger and Britwater soils are fine-loamy and are on lower terrace levels. Bearthicket soils are well drained and are on lower terrace levels.  Clarksville soils are loamy-skeletal and are on adjacent side slopes.  Roselle soils are fine-loamy and are at higher elevations.  Marquand soils have a decrease in clay in the lower part of the control section, and are on similar landscape positions. Tilk soils are loamy-skeletal and are on flood plains. In addition, none of these soils except Aslinger have a brittle (2Btx) layer.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Runoff potential is low to medium.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The saturated hydraulic conducivity is moderately high.   A perched high water table is present in most years at a depth of 2 to 3 feet.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are planted to grasses and legumes and used for pasture and hay crops.  The remaining acreage is mainly forested, with a small portion in small grain production.  The native vegetation was mixed hardwoods and shortleaf pines.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The Ozark Highland region (MLRA 116A) and the St. Francois Mountains region (MLRA 116C) of southeastern Missouri.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Madison County, Missouri 1998.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
1) Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 5 inches (Ap horizon);
2) argillic horizon - the zone from 5 to more than 60 inches (Bt, 2Btx1, 2Btx2, 3Bt horizons). 
3) fragic feature - compaction and brittleness from 17 to 39 inches (2Btx1, 2Btx2 horizons)
