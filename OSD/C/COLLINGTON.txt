MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Prince Georges County, Maryland, 1901

REMARKS:
01/2002.  Pedon relocated to Gloucester County, New Jersey. This revision restricts the range of glauconite pellet content to a weighted average of 10 to 20 percent, by volume within the mineralogy control section, and maintains the series in a mixed mineralogy family. It also changes the classification from Humic Hapludults to Typic Hapludults based on more current field observations throughout the MLRA area in which the soil is found. It also revises colors, textures, geographic setting, parent materials, and other RIC and properties of the soil.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 9 inches (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 9 to 30 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
