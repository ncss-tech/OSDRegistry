COWCAMP SERIES

The Cowcamp series consists of very deep, well-drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  These soils are on fan remnants, stream terraces, alluvial fans and outwash plains. These soils are subject to prolonged saturation from flood irrigation.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Oxyaquic Argicryolls

Mean annual precipitation - 14 to 20 inches
Mean annual air temperature - 34 to 39 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Beaverslide, Bighole, Mooseflat, Shewag and Wisdom soils.  The Beaverslide soils have greater than 35 percent clay in the control section and occur on remnant terraces and fans, Bighole soils are fine-loamy and occur on remnant terraces and fans, Mooseflat soils are very poorly drained and occur on floodplains and drainageways, Shewag soils are 10 to 20 inches to sand and gravel and occur on outwash plains, and Wisdom soils are fine-loamy over sandy skeletal and occur on outwash plains. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained (Oxyaquic moisture subclass due to prolonged saturation from flood irrigation); moderately slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Cowcamp soils are used for irrigated grass hay and irrigated pasture.  The vegetation is mainly Garrison creeping foxtail, meadow foxtail, timothy, tufted hairgrass, and other miscellaneous sedges, rushes and forbs.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Cowcamp soils are not extensive in the intermountain valleys of southwestern Montana. MLRAs - 43B, 44B.
