COZAD SERIES

The Cozad series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in silty alluvium on stream terraces along the Platte River system in Nebraska.  Slope is typically 0 to 5 percent, but ranges up to 11 percent on the terrace riser.  Mean annual precipitation is 58 centimeters (23 inches) at the type location.   Mean annual temperature is 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cozad silt loam on a 1 percent slope in a cultivated field.  When described, the soil was moist throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  Ap--0 to 20 centimeters (0 to 8 inches); gray (10YR 5/1) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.

  A--20 to 30 centimeters (8 to 12 inches); gray (10YR 5/1) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of A horizon ranges from 7 to 20 inches.)

  Bw--30 to 46 centimeters (12 to 18 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 12 inches thick)

  C1--46 to 122 centimeters (18 to 48 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very fine sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable; thin stratification; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.

  C2--122 to 203 centimeters (48 to 80 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very fine sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable; thin stratification; slight effervescence; slightly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Buffalo County, Nebraska; one mile north and one mile west of Odessa, Nebraska; 30 meters (100 feet) west and 64 meters (210 feet) north of the southeast corner, sec. 29, T. 9 N., R. 17 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section is moist in some part from April to September;
Moisture regime: ustic
Depth to secondary carbonates: 25 to 122 centimeters (10 to 48 inches)
Thickness of mollic epipedon: 18 to 51 centimeters (7 to 20 inches)
Thickness of solum: 36 to 81 centimeters (14 to 32 inches)
Comment: buried soils are common

Particle size control section (weighted average)
Clay: 10 to 18 percent

A horizon:
Hue; 10YR
Value: 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: typically is silt loam, but range from loam, fine sandy loam, silty clay loam, or very fine sandy loam
Reaction: slightly acid or neutral

Bw horizon: (BC horizon if present)
Hue of 10YR
Value: 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam
Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline

C horizon:
Hue of 10YR
Value: 5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: silt loam or very fine sandy loam stratified with coarser and finer textured material.  Some pedons have layers of stratified clayey to sandy material below a depth of 40 inches
Reaction: neutral to moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Kenesaw and Lowry soils.   
Kenesaw and Lowry soils are on uplands and formed in loess.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent Material: alluvium 
Landform: stream terraces typically along streams or drains which have received recent sediments.  Slopes: 0 to 5 percent, but the extreme range is 0 to 11 percent.  
Mean annual precipitation: 48 to 74 centimeters (19 to 29 inches).
Mean annual temperature: 10 to 13 degrees C (49 degrees to 56 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Gosper, Hall, Hobbs, Hord, and Wood River soils.  
Gosper soils have a fine-loamy control section and an argillic horizon.  
Hall and Hord soils have a thicker mollic epipedon.  
Gosper, Hall, and Hord soils occur at a higher elevation.  
Hobbs soils are stratified above a depth of 10 inches and occur at a lower elevation.  
Wood River soils have a fine control section and an argillic horizon and occur at a lower elevation.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage: well  
Runoff: low or moderate  
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: moderately high

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are cultivated and much of it is irrigated.  
The main crops are corn, alfalfa, and sorghums.  
The native grasses are big bluestem, switchgrass, little bluestem, and western wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Nebraska and north central Kansas.  The series is moderately extensive.  

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Buffalo County, Nebraska, June 1970.

REMARKS:  
The diagnostic horizons and characteristics recognized in this soil are:  
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 30 centimeters (0 to 12 inches) (Ap and A horizons). 
Cambic horizon: 30 to 46 centimeters (12 to 18 inches) (Bw horizon). 
Organic carbon: irregular decrease in content.
OSD Modification: C horizon some pedons have layers of stratified clayey to sandy material below 102 centimeters (40 inches). 

Phases of this series that have been correlated include saline-alkali and wet substratum.  
Cozad was in the fine-silty family, but laboratory data showed it to be coarse-silty.  

10/3/02 PRF
Modified the classification to "Typic".  This soil formed on stable stream terraces and no evidence of stratification is identified.  Lab data supports a "regular" decrease in organic matter.
