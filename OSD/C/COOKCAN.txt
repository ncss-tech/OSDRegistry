COOKCAN SERIES

The Cookcan series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils on flood plains. They formed in stratified alluvium. Permeability is moderate. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the  Cowbone, Fram, and Wyndmere series. Cowbone soils do not have secondary carbonate accumulation below 23 inches. Fram soils have accumulations of gypsum in the lower part of the control section and occur on ground moraines. Wyndmere soils are somewhat poorly drained, have a water table at two to five feet and occur on delta and glacial lacustrine plains.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cookcan soils are on flood plains. They have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. They formed in stratified alluvium. The average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches, and the average annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is about 70 to 100 days. Elevations are 4,900 to 6,250 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the  Bear Lake,  Blackotter (T),  Millerditch (T), and  Nuffer (T) series. Bear Lake soils have a fine-silty particle-size control section. Blackotter soils have a coarse-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal particle-size control section. Millerditch soils are somewhat poorly drained and have a xeric soil moisture regime. Nuffer soils have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section and a mollic epipedon greater than 20 inches thick. Bear Lake soils are on flood plains and in concave positions on wider valley bottoms. Blackotter soils are on similar landscapes as Cookcan. Millerditch and Nuffer soils are on similar landscapes but on slightly higher areas.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained; slow or very slow runoff; moderate permeability; rare flooding for brief periods April through June.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for hayland or meadow pasture. Vegetation is mainly Nebraska sedge, sedges, tufted hairgrass, and slender wheatgrass

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: This soil is of small extent in southern Idaho.
