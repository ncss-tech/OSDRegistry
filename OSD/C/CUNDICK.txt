CUNDICK SERIES

The Cundick series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived from limestone. These soils occur on mesas, ridges and buttes.  Slopes are 1 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 3.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON: Cundick gravelly loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated).

     A--0 to 15 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine, and few medium roots; few fine and common very fine irregular pores; 15 percent subangular limestone gravel; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 20 cm thick)

     Btk--15 to 42 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine and few fine dendritic tubular pores; 20 percent faint clay films on vertical faces of peds; 20 percent subangular limestone gravel; 1 percent fine faint irregular carbonate masses in the matrix, and finely disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); clear smooth boundary. (20 to 40 cm thick)

     Bk--42 to 68 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; few very fine and fine dendritic tubular pores; 25 percent subangular limestone gravel and 5 percent limestone flagstones; 3 percent fine faint irregular carbonate masses in the matrix, and finely disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); gradual smooth boundary. (15 to 45 cm thick)

     BCk--68 to 84 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine dendritic tubular pores; 25 percent subangular limestone gravel and 10 percent subangular limestone flagstones; 2 percent fine faint irregular carbonate masses in the matrix, and finely disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 25 cm thick)

     R--84 cm; strongly cemented limestone bedrock
