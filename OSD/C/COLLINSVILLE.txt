COLLINSVILLE SERIES

The Collinsville series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained to somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapid permeable soils that formed in residuum weathered from sandstone of Pennsylvania age.  These very gently sloping to steep soils are on prairie uplands mainly in the Cherokee Prairies (MLRA 112).   Slopes are 1 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 40 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is 61 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, siliceous, superactive, thermic Lithic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Collinsville fine sandy loam--rangeland.
         Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A--0 to 7 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 14 inches thick)

     C--7 to 9 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; massive; slightly hard, very friable; 40 percent soft and hard fragments of sandstone by volume; moderately acid abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 6 inches thick)

     R--9 to 20 inches; yellowish brown sandstone; hard; fractured at intervals from 1 foot to 3 feet with small amount of soil material in the cracks.

TYPE LOCATION:  Rogers County, Oklahoma; about 2 miles north and 1.5 miles east of Inola; 1,000 feet east and 45 feet south of the northwest corner of sec. 27, T. 20 N., R. 17 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to lithic contact with sandstone bedrock ranges from 4 to 20 inches.  The weighted average content of coarse fragments in the control section is less than 35 percent.

The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, gravelly fine sandy loam, gravelly loam, cobbly fine sandy loam, cobbly loam, stony fine sandy loam, or stony loam.  Content of coarse fragments of sandstone make up from 0 to 35 percent by volume.  About 0 to 30 percent by volume is less than 76 mm in diameter, 0 to 30 percent by volume is 76 mm to 250 mm in diameter, and 0 to 30 percent is more than 250 mm in diameter.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.

Where present, a thin Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, gravelly fine sandy loam, gravelly loam, cobbly fine sandy loam, cobbly loam, stony fine sandy loam, or stony loam.  Content of coarse fragments of sandstone make up from 0 to 35 percent by volume.  About 0 to 30 percent by volume is less than 76 mm in diameter, 0 to 30 percent by volume is 76 mm to 250 mm in diameter, and 0 to 30 percent is more than 250 mm in diameter.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.

The C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.    Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, gravelly fine sandy loam, gravelly loam, cobbly fine sandy loam, cobbly loam, stony fine sandy loam, or stony loam.  Content of coarse fragments of sandstone make up from 0 to 50 percent by volume.  About 0 to 30 percent by volume is less than 76 mm in diameter, 0 to 30 percent by volume is 76 mm to 250 mm in diameter, and 0 to 30 percent by volume more than 250 mm in diameter.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.

The R layer is brownish hard sandstone that cannot be augered.  The sandstone does not break down upon overnight shaking in calgon.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Collinsville soils are on very gently sloping to steep uplands mainly in the Cherokee Prairies (MLRA 112).  Slope gradients are between 1 and  35 percent. They formed in residuum weathered from sandstone.  The climate is subhumid to humid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 37 to 45 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 57 to 62 degrees F. Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 64 to 80.  Frost free days range from 200 to 220.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Barco, Barden, Bates, Choteau, Dennis, Eram, and Talihina series.  All of these soils except Talihina soils have a solum thickness of more than 20 inches and have an argillic horizon.  Talihina soils are clayey, and formed in residuum weathered from shale.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained to somewhat excessively drained; medium to very high runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The soil is used mainly for native range. Small amounts are used for tame pasture on non-stony phases.  The native vegetation is tall grass prairie.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mainly in the Cherokee Prairies of Oklahoma, Kansas, and Missouri.  The series is extensive.

REMARKS:  Data on mineralogy are lacking, but data for the related and associated Bates soil has siliceous mineralogy.

Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 7 inches (the A horizon).
Lithic contact - hard sandstone bedrock at a depth of 9 inches ( the R layer).
Moisture Regime - Udic
