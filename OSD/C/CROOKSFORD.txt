CROOKSFORD SERIES

The Crooksford series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of glacial lacustrine sediments or loess and in the underlying till. These soils are on slightly concave to convex slopes on ground moraines and lake plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 735 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Oxyaquic Hapludolls

(Combined thickness of the 2Bk horizon is 25 to 50 centimeters.)

    2C--109 to 203 centimeters; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) loam; massive; friable; carbonates in few light gray (10YR 7/2) medium and coarse soft masses; common medium distinct grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) iron depletions and common fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) iron concentrations; about 6 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

Leen--are on lower landscape positions on footslopes or in drainageways and are frequently saturated at the surface to a depth of 0.45 meter during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Louris--are on lower landscape positions on low knolls and have a frequently saturated zone between depths of 0.45 and 0.75 meter during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Okoboji--are on lower landscape positions in depressions and have a mollic epipedon 60 to 150 centimeters thick
Seaforth--are on landscape positions similar to those of the Crooksford soils and have a sand content that averages 20 to 35 percent in the particle-size control section

udic moisture regime.

Oxyaquic subgroup based on saturation above a depth of 1 meter and is supported by the presence of redoximorphic features.
