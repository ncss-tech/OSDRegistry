MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Alexander County, North Carolina, 1988. 

REMARKS:  Cowee soils were previously mapped with Saluda and Evard.  The Cowee Series recognizes soils that are moderately deep, 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches), to weathered bedrock.  Saluda soils are shallow and Evard soils are very deep.
The 1/98 revision places the Cowee series in a fine-loamy, parasesquic, mesic Typic Hapludults family. The series was formerly in a mixed mineralogy family. CEC activity class placement is based on sample pedon S85-NC-099-003 and on similar soils such as Brevard and Evard.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
a. Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 18 cm, 0 to 7 inches (Oi and A horizons)
b. Argillic horizon--the zone from 18 to 74 cm, 7 to 29 inches (Bt horizons)
c. Paralithic contact--the contact with weathered rock at 74 cm, 29 inches (upper boundary of the Cr horizon).
d. Parasesquic mineralogy class - total iron oxide, by weight (DCB Fe multiplied by 1.43) plus percent, by weight, gibbsite of more than 25 cm, 10 in the fine-earth fraction. 
e. Series control section--the zone from 18 to 69cm, 7 to 27 inches
