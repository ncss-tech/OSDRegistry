CANADICE SERIES

The Canadice series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed dominantly in clayey glaciolacustrine sediments on Wisconsinan age lake plains, slackwater terraces and valley floors. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is very low. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 9.5 degrees C., and the mean annual precipitation is about 965 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, illitic, mesic Typic Endoaqualfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Canadice silty clay loam, on a 1 percent slope in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

   Ap -- 0 to 23 centimeters; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silty clay loam, gray (10YR 6/1) dry; moderate coarse blocky structure; friable, slightly plastic; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (20 to 30 centimeters thick.)

   Btg1 -- 23 to 61 centimeters; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay; strong very coarse prismatic structure parting to weak and moderate medium angular blocky; firm, plastic, sticky; many faint gray (2.5Y 5/1) clay films on faces of peds; common fine and medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6 and 5/8) masses of iron accumulation in the matrix; neutral; gradual wavy boundary.

   Btg2 -- 61 to 81 centimeters; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay; strong very coarse prismatic structure parting to weak and moderate coarse and very coarse angular blocky; firm, plastic, sticky; many faint gray (2.5Y 5/1) clay films on faces of peds; many fine and medium prominent yellowish brown(10YR 5/6 and 5/8) masses of iron accumulation in the matrix; neutral; gradual wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Btg horizon is 30 to 91 centimeters.)

   BCg -- 81 to 102 centimeters; gray (2.5Y 5/1) silty clay; weak very coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium angular blocky; firm, plastic, sticky; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/4 and 5/6) masses of iron accumulation in the matrix; slightly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 35 centimeters thick.)

   Cg -- 102 to 183 centimeters; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay; few medium distinct dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) and prominent gray (N 5/0) mottles; massive; firm; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Chautauqua County, New York; 1 1/2 miles north of VanBuren, about three miles southwest of Dunkirk near road corner. USGS Brockton, New York topographic quadrangle; Latitude 42 degrees, 27 minutes, 44 seconds N. and Longitude 79 degrees, 23 minutes, 04 seconds W., NAD 1927.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 71 to 147 centimeters. Depth to bedrock is greater than 150 centimeters. Rock fragments, mainly gravel and channers, range from 0 to 2 percent throughout the soil, but are commonly absent.

The A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4, with value of 4 or 5 restricted to Ap horizons. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Structure is weak or moderate, fine to coarse, granular, subangular blocky or angular blocky. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid. Areas that have been limed range to neutral.

The Eg or Bg horizon, where present, has hue of  10YR, 2.5Y or neutral, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.

The Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or is neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2. Faces of peds have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or neutral, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 0 to 2 above 76 centimeters, and 0 to 4 below 76 centimeters. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay. Structure is weak to strong, medium to very coarse prismatic, or medium to coarse, angular blocky or subangular blocky. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly alkaline.

The BC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, or is neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 4. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay. Structure is weak, coarse or very coarse, prismatic, angular blocky or subangular blocky. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly alkaline.

The C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or is neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 4. Texture is silty clay or clay. Some pedons may have strata of silt loam, loam, silty clay loam or clay loam. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: The Wetzel series is the only other series in this family. The Wetzel soils have a rock fragment content ranging from 2 to 15 percent in the lower part of the B and C horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Canadice soils are on broad concave flats and depressions on Wisconsinan age lake plains, slackwater terraces and valley floors. These soils formed dominantly in clayey glaciolacustrine sediments. In some areas the lake sediments are underlain by Wisconsinan age till substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Elevations range from 174 to 396 meters msl. The climate is humid temperate. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 735 to 1168 millimetes. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.5 to 11.5 degrees C. The mean growing season ranges from 110 to 198 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Caneadea, Canadaigua, Fonda, Lorain, Rhinebeck, Stanhope, Teel, Wallkill, Wayland and Wick soils. The somewhat poorly drained Caneadea soils on higher landscape positions and the very poorly drained Lorain soils on lower landscape positions are in a toposequence with Canadice soils. The Canandaigua and Fonda soils have mollic epipedons and are on lower landscape positions. The somewhat poorly drained Rhinebeck soils are on higher landscape positions. The Stanhope, Teel, Wallkill, Wayland and Wick soils are coarser textured and are on nearby flood plains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low to low. Depth to an intermittent apparent water table is 0 to 60 centimeters from November to June in normal years. Some areas have frequent brief ponding occurs during periods of heavy rainfall and spring snowmelt.

USE AND VEGETATION: The soil was originally covered with mixed hardwoods, however, at present, about 30 percent is cropped, 30 percent is pastured, and the remainder is in farm woodlots or is idle.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western New York, northeastern Ohio, and northern Pennsylvania. MLRA's 101, 124, 139, and 140. The soils of this series are moderately extensive, about 52,000 acres in size.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Crawford County, Pennsylvania, 1946.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typifying pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 23 centimeters (Ap horizon). 
Argillic horizon - the zone from 23 to 81 centimeters (Btg1 and Btg2 horizons).
Aquic conditions - begin at a depth of 23 centimeters.
Typic subgroup - the zone to 75 centimeters below the soil surface is dominated by more than 60 percent with chroma of 2 or less (Btg1 and Btg2 horizons).
