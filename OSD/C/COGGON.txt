COGGON SERIES

The Coggon series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in 36 to 56 centimeters (14 to 22 inches) of silty or loamy sediments and the underlying glacial till. These soils are on interfluves and side slopes on dissected till plains. Slopes range from 1 to 9 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C (47 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 81 centimeters (32 inches).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 28 centimeters (0 to 11 inches) (A and E horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 43 to 157 centimeters (17 to 62 inches) (2Bt1,2Bt2, 2Bt3, and 2Bt4 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Some pedons have vertical seams or wedges of sand or loamy sand about 5 to 15 centimeters (2 to 6 inches) wide and about 0.9 to 1.2 meters (3 to 4 feet) deep extending downward from the stone line into the glacial till.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

Oxyaquic subgroup based on a zone of saturation within 100 centimeters (39 inches) for 20 or more consecutive days or 30 or more cumulative days in normal years.
