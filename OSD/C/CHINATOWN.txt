CHINATOWN SERIES

The Chinatown series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from interbedded shale, siltstone and sandstone.  These soils occur on hills.  Slopes are 4 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Chinatown loam, in rangeland on a 5 percent slope at an elevation of 1850 meters (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

 A--0 to 8 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 10 cm thick)

(0 to 18 cm thick)

 Bk--36 to 56 cm; light reddish brown (2.5YR 7/3) gravelly loam, light reddish brown (2.5YR 6/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 20 percent gravel; finely disseminated calcium carbonate, and 30 percent fine and medium soft masses and threads of calcium carbonate throughout; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (15 to 35 cm thick)

 BCk--56 to 71 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly loam, reddish brown (2.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 55 percent gravel; finely disseminated calcium carbonate and 30 percent fine and medium soft masses and threads of calcium carbonate throughout; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 20 cm thick)

 R--71 to 152 cm; siltstone bedrock.
