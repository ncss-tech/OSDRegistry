CLEAVER SERIES

The Cleaver series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from igneous rocks.  Cleaver soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 130 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Typic Argidurids

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Corder, Laped, Shoofly, Silent, Spanel, and Tumtum series. 

Corder and Laped soils have lithic contacts at depths of 50 to 76 cm.  Shoofly soils have duripans less than 15 cm thick.  Silent soils are calcareous throughout.  Spanel soils are moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and September and October due to convection storms.  Tumtum soils have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 9 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cleaver soils are on fan remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium derived primarily from igneous rock.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,220 to 1,520 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 180 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Bluewing and Theon soil. Bluewing is sandy-skeletal and lacks a duripan. Theon soils are shallow over bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Cleaver soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Bailey greasewood, shadscale, Nevada ephedra, and cheatgrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western and north-central Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRAs 26 and 27.
