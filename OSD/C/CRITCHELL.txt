CRITCHELL SERIES

The Critchell series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium derived from reddish brown sedimentary rocks. Critchell soils are on fans, terraces, strike valleys and valley sideslopes. Slopes of 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:Critchell gravelly sandy loam, nonirrigated cropland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap--0 to 15 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky; 15 to 20 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 20 cm thick)

    BA--15 to 23 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly sandy clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky; very thin clay films on faces of peds; 15 to 25 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 13 cm thick)

    Bt2--38 to 66 cm; reddish gray (5YR 5/2) gravelly sandy clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; very hard, friable, sticky; moderately thick continuous clay films on faces of peds; 15 to 25 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of Bt horizons - 30 to 65 cm)

    BC--66 to 89 cm; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) gravelly sandy clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak moderate prismatic structure parting to weak moderate subangular blocky; very hard, friable, sticky; few thin clay films on the faces of peds; 20 to 30 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 25 cm thick)

    C1--89 to 132 cm; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) gravelly sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak coarse subangular blocky; hard, friable; 30 to 35 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 56 cm thick)

    C2--132 to 152 cm; pink (5YR 7/4) gravelly coarse sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) moist; massive; hard, very friable; 30 to 40 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).
