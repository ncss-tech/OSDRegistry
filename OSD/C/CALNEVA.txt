CALNEVA SERIES

The Calneva series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed igneous rocks.  Calneva soils are on lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

Uzona soils formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale, have visible soluble salts, and are more moist in the summer months.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Calneva soils are on lake terraces and usually occur with small, irregularly shaped playas.  These soils formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed igneous rocks such as andesite, basalt, and granodiorite.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  Low hummocks are a common microfeature on these soils.  Elevation ranges from 4,000 to 4,010 feet.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 49 to 52 degrees F., the mean January temperature is about 30 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is about 68 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Epot and Wespac soils.  Epot soils are fine-silty.  Wespac soils are fine-loamy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; low surface runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Calneva soils are used for rangeland.  The vegetation is mainly shadscale, black greasewood, spiny hopsage, and bud sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern California.  These soils are not extensive with about 6,500 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 23, 27.
