CROT SERIES

The Crot series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in old lake and fan deposited alluvium from mixed sources, including rhyolite, andesite, quartzite, granite and limestone. Crot soils are on alkali flats bordering playas with slopes of 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Ustic Natrargids

(3 to 7 inches thick)

     Btkng2--17 to 20 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) coarse sandy loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist, few medium faint light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) mottles, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic; few coarse roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; few thin clay films in root channels; strongly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.6); abrupt wavy boundary.

TYPE LOCATION:  Cochise County, Arizona; 400 feet S. and 2,550 feet E.  of the NW corner of sec. 23, T.14S., R.24E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  


Depth to the Btkn horizon: 5 to 30 inches.

The argillic horizon has 15 to 30 percent saturation with exchangeable sodium.  

Mean annual soil temperature: 59 degrees to 68 degrees F.

Soil moisture: Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July-September and December-February and for less than 90 days cumulative in some part of the epipedon. Driest during May and June. Ustic aridic moisture regime

A horizon (present in some pedons) 
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR
Value: 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3

E horizon
Value: 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 1 through 3
Texture: silt loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam and clay loam.
Reaction: moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.

B horizon
Hue: 5Y through 10YR (dominantly 10YR and 2.5Y)
Value: 5 through 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 1 through 3
Reaction: strongly to very strongly alkaline
The gleyed horizon occurs at depths of less than 20 inches
The soil may have a buried Bt horizon at depths of 36 inches or more

The C horizon
Hue: 2.5Y or 5Y but ranges to 10YR with some 5YR mottles
Texture: sandy clay loam, clay loam, clay, loamy sand, gravelly loamy sand, gravelly sand, silt loam, loam or sandy loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Gothard (AZ) and Sikes (NM) series.  Gothard soils are moderately well-drained and lack gleyed mottles.  Sikes soils have a watertable. Sikes would classify as an Epiaquolls or an Endoaquolls. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Crot soils are on level to nearly level alkali flats bordering playas at elevations of 3,800 to 4,300 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent but may have uneven microrelief due to wind shifting of the surface soil.  These soils formed in old lake and fan deposited alluvium from mixed sources, including rhyolite, andesite, quartzite, granite and limestone.  The climate is warm semiarid continental.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 58 degrees to 66 degrees F.  The frost-free period ranges from 155 to 220 days.  The annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 12 inches and occurs as thundershowers from July through September and as gentle fall and winter rains.  The months of May and June are usually dry.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  In addition to the competing Cogswell, Duncan, Gothard, Karro and Stewart soils, these are the McAllister soils.  McAllister soils do not have an A2 or natric horizon and are well drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; slow runoff; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for range and limited irrigated cultivated crops.  Native vegetation is alkali sacaton, saltgrass, tobosa, scattered mesquite, annual weeds and grasses, and up to 50 percent barren areas.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Arizona and possibly southwestern New Mexico adjacent to playas and intermittent streams.  The series is moderately extensive. MLRA 41.
