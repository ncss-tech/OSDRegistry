Brystal, Pryor, and Tonio soils: have an ochric epipedon; occur on a slightly higher landscape position.  
Knippa, Leoncita and Uvalde soils: do not have an argillic horizon; occur on a similar landscape position.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained. Permeability is moderate. Runoff is negligible for slopes less than 1 percent and low on slopes from 1 to 5 percent.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mostly rangeland.  Small areas are dry-farmed to such crops as small grain, grain sorghum, and introduced grasses. Small areas are irrigated to such crops as cotton, corn, grain sorghum, small grain, truck crops, and introduced grasses.  The original plant community was open grassland dominated by mid-grasses with occasional mesquite trees and woody shrubs.  Bundleflower, bushsunflower, and orange zexmania are important forbs.  In early stages of retrogression, such plants as pink pappusgrass and plains bristlegrass increase but decrease with further deterioration.  Other plants which increase or invade are hooded windmillgrass, Hall panicum, curlymesquite, threeawn, red grama, mesquite, whitebrush, blackbrush, condalia, wolfberry, spiny hackberry, guayacan, guajillo, twisted acacia, Texas persimmon, and pricklypear cactus. Ecological site is Clay loam 18-25" PZ; (R083BY416TX).
