EXTENT: Small

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Avery County, North Carolina; 1997

REMARKS: Soils now included with the Crossnore series were previously mapped with Jeffrey soils. Jeffrey soils have hard bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.

The 1/98 revision places Crossnore soils in a fine-loamy, isotic, mesic Umbric Dystrochrepts family. This series was formerly placed in a coarse-loamy, mixed, mesic Umbric Dystrochrepts family.  Laboratory PSA (pipette) method and corresponding field texture estimates (feel method) indicate control section clay contents of generally 12 to 24 percent, with most pedons marginally coarse-loamy.  However, chemical lab data for similar competing series indicate that sufficient amorphous, clay-sized materials occur in the particle-size control section to place this soil in a fine-loamy family.  Average clay contents are generally less than 25 percent.  Additionally, depth to hard bedrock was changed from more than 60 inches to more than 40 inches.

Using the 7th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy (1996), Crossnore soils would classify as fine-loamy, isotic, mesic Andic Dystrochrepts.  However, a proposal has been made to add a acid oxalate-extractable silicon requirement to Andic subgroups, which would exclude Crossnore soils, which lack volcanic glass.

The 2/99 revision updates classification to the 8th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon (umbric-like feature) - the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 7 inches (A horizon)

Cambic horizon - the zone from 7 to 22 inches (Bw and BC horizons)

Paralithic contact - weathered bedrock contact at 30 inches (upper boundary of the Cr horizon)

Isotic mineralogy class - within the PSCS the soil generally has high amorphous materials (high pH-dependent charge) and a high moisture retention (at 1500 kPa) to clay ratio.

Properties that would place the soil in an Andic subgroup--a horizon or horizons with total thickness of 7 inches (18 cm) or more within 30 inches (75 cm) of the mineral soil surface with a fine-earth bulk density of 1.0 g/cm3 or less (at 33 kPa water retention) and ammonium oxalate extractable aluminum plus 1/2 iron percentages totaling more than 1.0.
