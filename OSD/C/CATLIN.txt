CATLIN SERIES

The Catlin series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on till plains. These soils formed in loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy calcareous till. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual temperature is 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is 890 mm (35 inches).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Assumption, Aviston, Barrington, Blackberry, Buckhart, Clare, Dana, Danabrook, Geryune, Graymont, Harrison, Keltner, Saybrook, and Totanang soils. Assumption and Harrison soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Aviston soils have less than 15 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Barrington, Blackberry, and Clare soils have horizons in the middle or lower part of the series control section with sand content greater than 40 percent. Buckhart soils have less than 7 percent sand throughout the series control section. Dana, Danabrook, Geryune, Graymont and Saybrook soils have horizons with more than 15 percent sand within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Keltner soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Totanang soils have more than 10 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Catlin soils are on relatively undissected loess covered till plains. Slopes typically are between 3 and 7 percent, but range from 0 to 15 percent and are convex. Catlin soils formed in 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) of loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy calcareous till. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.8 to 12.8 degrees C (46 to 55 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 864 to 1067 mm (34 to 42 inches), frost free period ranges from 150 to 190 days, and elevation ranges from 180 to 305 meters (590 to 1000 feet) above sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Saybrook soils and the Drummer, Elburn, Flanagan, and Plano soils. The poorly drained Drummer soils and the somewhat poorly drained Flanagan soils are on lower lying parts of the landscape and form a drainage sequence with Catlin soils. The Plano and somewhat poorly drained Elburn soils are on adjacent or nearby outwash plains. Saybrook soils are on similar nearby landscapes where the loess mantle is thinner. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. A perched seasonal high water table is 61 to 107 cm (2.0 to 3.5 feet) below the surface at some time between February and April in most years. The potential for surface runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the solum and moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers per second) in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderately slow in the underlying material. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Almost all areas used to grow corn and soybeans. Native vegetation is prairie grass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Catlin soils are in central and northern Illinois. LRR M, MLRAs 95B, 108A, 108B, 110, and 115C. They are of large extent (more than 305,000 acres are correlated).
