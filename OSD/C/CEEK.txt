CEEK SERIES

The Ceek series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium over residuum both derived from interbedded sandstone and shale.  Ceek soils are on moderately steep to steep mountain slopes.  Slopes are 5 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, frigid Inceptic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ceek very flaggy clay loam - forest.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 1 inch; slightly decomposed pine needles.

    A--1 to 6 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) very flaggy clay loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate fine granular structure; hard, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium pores and roots; 10 percent gravel and 30 percent flagstones; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 7 inches thick)

    E--6 to 14 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) very cobbly clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium pores and roots; 10 percent gravel and 40 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt--14 to 23 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very cobbly clay loam, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few fine pores and roots; 10 percent gravel, 35 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones; few distinct clay films on faces of peds; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (7 to 13 inches thick)

    2Bk1--23 to 32 inches; weak red (2.5YR 4/2) clay, dusky red (2.5YR 3/2) moist; massive; extremely hard, firm, sticky and plastic; 10 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (9 to 20 inches thick)

    2Bk2--32 to 61 inches; reddish gray (5YR 5/2) clay, dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2) moist; massive; hard, very friable, sticky and plastic; 5 percent gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  Soils that were competing series prior to the Seventh Edition of Soil Taxonomy (and may be reclassified to this family) are the Fishers, Ormiston, and Pleioville series.  Fishers soils do not have accumulations of secondary carbonates above 30 inches.  Ormiston soils have a calcic horizon.  Pleioville soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ceek soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 5 to 40 percent.  The soil formed in colluvium over residuum both derived from interbedded sandstone and shale.  Elevation ranges from 7,400 to 9,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 24 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 43 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 65 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Acree, Fivepine, Nortez, Pino, and Zoltay soils.  Acree soils have a mollic epipedon. Fivepine soils have a lithic contact above 20 inches.  Nortez and Pino soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Zoltay soils have a mollic epipedon thicker than 16 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing and timber production. Principal native vegetation is ponderosa pine, Rocky Mountain juniper, Gambel oak, Oregon grape, muttongrass, elk sedge, mountain muhly, and snowberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Colorado. MLRA 34, 48A. The series is of moderate extent.

REMARKS: This revision changes the classification from clayey-skeletal, montmorillonitic Mollic Eutroboralfs to clayey-skeletal, smectitic, frigid Ochreptic Haplustalfs.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon: from 1 to 6 inches (A horizon).
Argillic horizon and particle-size control section: from 14 to 23 inches (Bt horizon).
An ustic soil moisture regime.
