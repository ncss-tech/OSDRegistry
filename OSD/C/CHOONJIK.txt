REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features in this pedon
*Particle-size control section--zone from 35 to 110 cm
*Ochric epipedon
*Free carbonates--Bw, Bkn, and C horizons
*Cambic horizon--Bw horizon
Soils in this series do not meet the criteria for a mollic epipedon due to thickness.
Where secondary carbonates are not visible, pedogenic accumulation of carbonates is inferred from increase in effervescence and pH compared to surrounding horizons. See pedon IDs S2014AK290001 and S2014AK290002 in the NCSS database for supporting calcium carbonate data.
Sodic properties may be present in some horizons with an exchangeable sodium percentage of more than 15 percent, but these horizons do not meet diagnostic criteria for a natric horizon. See pedon IDs S2014AK290001 and S2014AK290002 in the NCSS database for supporting chemical data.
