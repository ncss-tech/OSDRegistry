CULEBRA SERIES

The Culebra series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in gravelly colluvium derived from igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rock. These soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes are 5 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Calciustepts 

TYPICAL PEDON: Culebra very gravelly coarse sandy loam, 5 to 65 percent slope in forestland at an elevation of 8,885 feet (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

   A--0 to 8 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 4/3) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; 12 percent clay; weak fine granular structure; friable, soft, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine and medium roots throughout; calcium carbonate coatings (relict) on rock fragments; 35 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.

   Bk--8 to 28 centimeters; light brown (7.5YR 6/3) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; 12 percent clay; weak fine granular structure; friable, soft, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine and medium roots throughout; common calcium carbonate coatings on bottom surface of rock fragments and few fine threadlike carbonate masses; 45 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent;  slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt irregular boundary.

   R--28 centimeters; fractured sandstone bedrock; calcium carbonate coatings on bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cedarknoll, Hackling, Rencot, Rentsac and Schoonover series. 
Cedarknoll soils have a cambic horizon and depth to calcic horizon is 20 to 28 centimeters.
Hackling soils have hues of 2.5 YR or 5YR throughout. 
Rencot and Schoonover soils have greater than 18 percent clay (weighted average) in the particle-size control section.
Rentsac soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control between four-tenths and five-tenths of the cumulative days per year that the soil temperature at a depth of 51 centimeters is 5 degrees C. or higher.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
