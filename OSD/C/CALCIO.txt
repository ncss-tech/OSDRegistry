COMPETING SERIES: These are the Gravesumit (CA), Onite (NM) and Yucca (NM) series. Gravesumit soils are more than 3 inches to the top of an argillic horizon. Onite and Yucca soils are moist in some part of the moisture control section for more than 20 days, cumulative, between July and September.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Calcio soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. These soils are formed in sandy alluvium from granite. Elevations are 1,880 to 3,140 feet. The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 2 to 6 inches; the mean annual air temperature is 64 to 69 degrees F. and the frost-free season is 240 to 300 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cajon, Desfirex and Edalph series. Cajon and Edalph soils do not have an argillic horizon. Cajon soils do not have a calcic horizon. Desfirex soils have a duripan at 20 to 40 inches and a fine-loamy particle size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; negligible to very low runoff; moderately rapid permeability in the upper part of the profile and rapid or very rapid permeability in the lower part of the profile.

USE AND VEGETATION: Calcio soils are used for military exercises and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly white bursage and creosotebush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southeastern California, U.S.A.; MLRA 30. These soils are of small extent.
