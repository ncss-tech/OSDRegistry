CONGER SERIES

The Conger series consists of soils that are very shallow and shallow to a petrocalcic horizon.  They are well drained soils that are, moderately permeable above and below a very slowly permeable petrocalcic horizon.  They formed in calcareous loamy eolian deposits over alluvium derived from limestone. These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping ridges and divides on dissected plateaus.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm (14 in) and mean annual air temperature is 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic, shallow Ustic Petrocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Conger loam--rangeland.

Thickness is 0 to 38 cm (0 to 15 in)

    Bkkm--43 to 99 cm (17 to 39 in); white caliche plates with a laminar upper surface layer 1/2 inch thick; caliche plates are strongly cemented; abrupt wavy boundary.  Thickness is 13 to 76 cm (5 to 30 in)

    BCk--99 to 203 cm (39 to 80 in); white weakly cemented caliche materials with about 50 percent visible calcium carbonate; massive.
