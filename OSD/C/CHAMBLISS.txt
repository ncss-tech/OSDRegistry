CHAMBLISS SERIES

The Chambliss series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy coastal plain sediments. These soils are on interfluves with concave or plain surfaces of the Willis and Whitsett Formation. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1397 mm (55 inch) and the mean annual temperature is about 19 degrees C (66 degrees F).

Letney, Tehran, Doucette, Boykin, and Shankler soils: have a loamy argillic horizon.
Choates soils:  on toe slope positions, and have a seasonal water table
