MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Perry County, Kentucky; 1978. 

REMARKS:
This revision removes the OSD from the original site in Perry County Kentucky to a site in Harlan County Kentucky where characterization data is available
Diagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are: 

Umbric epipedon: 0 to 19 inches (A, AB) 
Cambic horizon: 19 to 50 inches (Bw1, Bw2) 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization sample 84KY095005 is the OSD site; other samples analyzed include 73KY-019-043; 76KY-025-003; 76KY-025-004; 77KY193004; 82KY195005; 83KY195002; 84KY095004; 84KY095005; 86WV005004; activity class for this series runs the gambit from subactive to superactive with an average 0.46
