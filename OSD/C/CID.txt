CID SERIES


The Cid series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained or somewhat poorly drained soils on Piedmont uplands. These soils formed in residuum weathered from argillite and other fine-grained metavolcanic rocks. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 45 inches and mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F. near the type location.

TYPE LOCATION: Davidson County, North Carolina; 4.2 miles west of Denton on Flat Swamp Road; 0.5 miles north on N.C. Highway 8; 1/3 miles north on Shiptontown Road (State Road 2310); 100 feet west in pine forest.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to hard bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. This soil is extremely acid to strongly acid unless limed.  Content of coarse fragments, mainly channers, is 0 to 35 percent in the A and E horizons, 0 to 15 percent in the BA, BE, and Bt horizons, and 5 to 35 percent in the BC and BCg horizons.

The A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.

The E horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.

The BA or BE horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8. It is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.

The Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8, or is mottled in these colors. Redoximorphic accumulations in shades of red, brown, or yellow may be present. Redoximorphic depletions with chroma of 2 or less are within 24 inches of the upper boundary of this horizon. The Bt horizon is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay loam, or clay.

The BC horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8. Redoximrphic accumulations in shades of red, brown, or yellow and redoximorphic depletions in shades of gray, brown, and yellow are in most pedons. Texture is silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay in the fine earth fraction.

The BCg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Redoximorphic accumulations in shades of red, yellow, and brown are present. Texture is silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay in the fine earth fraction.

The BCtg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Redoximorphic accumulations in shades of red, yellow, and brown are present. Texture is silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay in the fine earth fraction.

The C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8. Redoximorphic accumulations in shades of red, brown, or yellow and redoximorphic depletions in shades of gray, brown, and yellow are in some pedons. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, or loam saprolite in the fine earth fraction.

The Cr horizon is weathered fractured argillite or other fine-grained metavolcanic bedrock.

The R horizon is unweathered, fractured argillite or other fine-grained metavolcanic rock.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Annemaine, Bush River (T), Craven, Creedmoor, Dogue, Eulonia, Gritney, Helena, Lignum, Mandale (T), Nemours, Nevarc, Newco, Prosperity (T), Rosenwall, Sacul, Stapp, Vinita, and Wolftever soils. Annemaine, Craven, Dogue, Eulonia, Gritney, Nemours, Nevarc, and Wolftever soils formed in marine sediments or alluvium and lack bedrock within a depth of 80 inches. Creedmoor soils have higher exchangeable aluminum and does not have bedrock within a depth of 40 inches. Helena soils are very deep. Lignum soils have a depth to soft bedrock of 40 to 60 inches.  Mandale (T) soils have a depth to bedrock of greater than 60 inches.  Newco and Stapp soils have red colors in the Bt horizon. Rosenwall, Sacul, and Vinita soils are underlain by shale or sandstone and contain fragments of those rocks.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cid soils are on undulating to gently sloping interstream divides, on lower side slopes, or on broad flats around the heads of drainageways on the uplands. Slope gradients are commonly 2 to 6 percent but range from 0 to 15 percent. These soils formed in residuum weathered from argillite and other fine-grained metavolcanic rocks. Mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F. near the type location.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Lignum and Mandale (T) series and the Alamance, Badin, Callison, Georgeville, Goldston, Herndon, Kirksey, Misenheimer, Montonia, Nanford, Nason, Oakboro, Secrest, Tarrus, and Tatum soils. Alamance, Badin, Georgeville, Goldston, Herndon, Nanford, Nason, Tarrus, and Tatum soils are well drained. Alamance, Callison, Kirksey, Montonia, and Secrest soils have less than 35 percent clay in the Bt horizon. In addition, Kirksey soils have a depth to hard bedrock of 40 to 60 inches and Secrest soils have a depth to soft bedrock of 40 to 60 inches.  Goldston and Misenheimer soils have loamy horizons less than 20 inches deep over a paralithic contact. Oakboro soils have less clay and are on flood plains.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained and somewhat poorly drained; slow to moderate runoff, slow permeability. This soil has a perched water table, 1.0 to 2.5 feet below the surface in the winter and spring.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mostly for forest with minor acreage in pasture, crops, or idle. Woodland consists primarily of shortleaf pine, loblolly pine, Virginia pine, southern red oak, white oak, willow oak, sweetgum, red maple, flowering dogwood, American holly, blackgum, post oak, black oak, scarlet oak, and eastern red cedar. Crops grown include corn, soybeans, small grains, and hay.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North Carolina, Virginia, and South Carolina. The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Davidson County, North Carolina; 1985.

REMARKS: This series was formerly included with the Lignum series. It differs mainly in having hard bedrock between depths of 20 to 40 inches.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 12 inches (A and E horizons)
Argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 12 to 26 inches below the surface (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Paralithic contact - the occurrence of soft, fractured bedrock at a depth of 29 inches (the upper boundary of the Cr horizon)
Lithic contact - the occurrence of hard fractured bedrock at a depth of 34 inches (the upper boundary of the R horizon)
