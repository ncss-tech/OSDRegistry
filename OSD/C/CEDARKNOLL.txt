CEDARKNOLL SERIES

The Cedarknoll series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits and slope alluvium over residuum derived from siltstone and sandstone.  Cedarknoll soils are on hill slopes and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Calciustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cedarknoll channery loam on a north-facing, convex-concave, 3 percent slope in pinyon pine - Utah juniper rangeland at an elevation of 7,120 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)   The surface is covered by 10 percent subangular gravel and 20 percent angular channers.

    A--0 to 2 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) channery loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak thin platy structure parting to moderate very fine subangular blocky; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; many fine vesicular pores; 10 percent gravel, 5 percent channers; very slightly effervescent, (4 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 3 inches thick)

    Bw--2 to 4 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) channery loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; sightless hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; common fine, few medium tubular pores; 15 percent channers, 10 percent gravel; slightly effervescent, (6 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 8 inches thick)

    Bk1--4 to 11 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very channery loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine, few medium tubular pores; 35 percent channers, 5 percent flagstones; strongly effervescent, (31 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated and segregated as 1 to 3 mm thick coats on undersides of rocks; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt smooth boundary.

    Bk2--11 to 14 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very channery loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots; common very fine, and fine, few medium tubular pores; 40 percent channers, 5 percent flagstones; violently effervescent, (29 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated and segregated as 1 to 3 mm thick coats around rocks; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); clear wavy boundary.  (The combined thickness of the Bk horizon ranges from 7 to 12 inches)

    R--14 inches; fractured unweathered siltstone bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Uintah County, Utah; about 35 miles south of Ouray; located about 500 feet west and 2,200 feet south of the northeast corner of sec. 23, T.14S., R.20E., SLBM; Flat Rock Mesa, Utah USGS quadrangle; lat. 39 degrees 35 minutes 11 seconds N. and long. 109 degrees 38 minutes 17 seconds W., NAD 27

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture:  The soil moisture control section is affected by precipitation that falls evenly throughout the year with a slight increase in late summer and early fall.  Ustic moisture regime, bordering on aridic.
Mean annual soil temperature:  42 to 45 degrees F.
Surface rock fragments:  25 to 35 percent channers and gravel.
Particle-size control section:  18 to 27 percent clay, 35 to 75 percent rock fragments (predominantly shale, siltstone, and sandstone)
Depth to lithic contact:  10 to 20 inches to siltstone bedrock
Depth to calcic horizon:  8 to 11 inches

A horizon:  The combination of thickness and colors does not meet the requirements for a mollic epipedon.
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma:  3 or 4 dry and moist
Texture:  channery loam or channery fine sandy loam
Rock fragments:  15 to 35 percent
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  1 to 10 percent
Reaction:  moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline

Bw horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma:  3 or 4 dry and moist
Texture:  channery loam or very channery loam
Rock fragments:  15 to 60 percent
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  1 to 10 percent
Reaction:  moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline 

Bk horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma:  3 or 4 dry and moist
Texture: very channery loam, extremely channery loam, or extremely flaggy loam
Rock fragments:  35 to 75 percent
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  15 to 40 percent
Reaction:  moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline

COMPETING SERIES:  These are Hackling, Rencot, and Schoonover series.
Hackling soils have hue redder than 7.5YR.

Rencot soils have a calcic horizon within 5 inches of the surface.

Schoonover soils have limestone rock fragments.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  eolian deposits and slope alluvium over residuum derived from siltstone and sandstone
Landform:  hill slopes and mountain slopes
Slopes:  2 to 25 percent
Elevation: 6,000 to 7,300 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  42 to 45 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  12 to 16 inches
Frost-free period:  90 to 110 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Gompers, Tabyago, and Whitesage series.

Gompers soils are on hill backslopes and do not have a calcic horizon.

Tabyago soils are on plateaus and are 20 to 40 inches deep over bedrock.

Whitesage soils are on fan remnants and have a fine-loamy particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, low and medium runoff, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are principally used for wildlife habitat, rangeland and recreation.  Potential native vegetation consists of pinyon pine, Utah juniper, black sagebrush, birchleaf mountain mahogany, bluebunch wheatgrass, salina wildrye, and Indian ricegrass.  This soil has been correlated to Upland Shallow Loam (Pinyon-Utah juniper) - 034XY322UT  range site in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Utah.  LRR D, MLRA 34.  This series is of small extent.
