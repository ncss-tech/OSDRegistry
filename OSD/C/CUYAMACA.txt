CUYAMACA SERIES

The Cuyamaca series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from quartz diorite and other igneous sources. Cuyamaca soils are on stream terraces and alluvial fans and have slopes of 5 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 720 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Cumulic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Cuyamaca soils in an area of Cuyamaca sandy loam on a slope of 4 percent facing east at an elevation of 1250 meters under a cover of annual grasses and forbs. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

 A2--27 to 51 centimeters; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) fine sandy loam, black (10YR 2/1), moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable, slightly hard, nonsticky, nonplastic; very few very fine roots; common medium and fine tubular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear smooth boundary. (20 to 30 cm thick)

  C2--125 to 145 centimeters; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), moist; single grain structure; loose, loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt wavy boundary.

  C3--145 to 160 centimeters; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), moist; single grain structure; loose, loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; neutral (pH 6.8)
