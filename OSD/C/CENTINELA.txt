CENTINELA SERIES


The Centinela series consists of well drained soils that formed in a thin surface mantle of human-transport materials (HTM) overlying alluvium from marine or mixed rock sources. Centinela soils are on alluvial fans remnant, inset fans, fluviomarine bottoms and low lying terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 342 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 17.2 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, thermic Vertic Haploxerepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Centinela loam, on a low lying alluvial deposit on an irrigated city park lawn at an elevation of 18 meters. (Colors are dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 ^A--0 to 7 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 35 cm thick)

 ^Cu--7 to 43 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, 5 percent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) and brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable, moderately hard, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few artifacts; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); few pockets of 10YR 5/6 from mechanical mixing; soil structure is remnant from source material; abrupt smooth boundary. (10 to 45 cm thick)

 2Bss--43 to 95 cm; clay, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; firm, very sticky and very plastic; common slickensides and many pressure faces on surfaces of peds; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary.

 2Bkss--95 to 140 cm; clay, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; firm, very sticky and very plastic; common slickensides and many pressure faces on surfaces of peds; common fine irregular calcium carbonate masses; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary.(combined thickness of 2Bss horizons is 60 to 110 cm.)

 2Bk--140 to 155 cm; clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) iron-manganese masses and common fine faint grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions; few fine irregular calcium carbonate masses; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).

REMARKS:

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - the zone form a depth of 0 to 7 cm
Human transported material - the zone from a depth of 0 to 43 cm
Secondary calcium carbonate - the zone from a depth of 95 to 155 cm
Slickensides - the zone from a depth of 43 to 140 cm
Particle-size control section - the zone from a depth of 43 to 100 cm

Centinela soils are in urban areas that typically have a thin surface layer of human-transported materials. Soils that do not have surface modification are included in this concept.

The lithologic discontinuity separating the anthropogenic material and natural soil is not series criteria.
