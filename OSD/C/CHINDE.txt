CHINDE SERIES

The Chinde series consists of very deep, well drained, saline-sodic soils. Chinde soils formed in alluvium derived from shale on toeslopes and knolls of undulating plateaus.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, mesic Leptic Haplogypsids

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competitors.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Chinde soils formed in alluvium derived from Cretaceous marine shale.  They are on toeslopes and knolls of undulating plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,200 to 5,600 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain from high-intensity thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual temperature is 51 to 54 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 140 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Benally, Fordbutte, Hamburn, Persayo, and Ravola soils.  Benally soils are fine-loamy with natric horizons.  Fordbutte soils are moderately deep to soft bedrock and have cambic horizons.  Persayo soils are shallow to soft bedrock.  Hamburn and Ravola soils lack diagnostic horizons and occur in adjacent flood plains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately slow permeability due to flocculation of clays by high content of soluble salts.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Chinde soils are used for livestock grazing.  Present vegetation is mat saltbush, alkali sacaton, Indian ricegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, and sickle saltbush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Chinde soils are of small extent in the western San Juan Basin and Four Corners Platform portions of the Colorado Plateau province in northwest New Mexico and possibly southwest Colorado. LRR-D; MLRA 35.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Shiprock Area, Parts of San Juan County, New Mexico and Apache County, Arizona; 1993.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of 2 inches.  (A horizon)

Gypsic horizon - The zone from 2 to about 9 inches. (By and BCy horizons)

Salic horizon - The zone from 33 to 64 inches. (Cnz1 and Cnz2 horizons)

Shrink-swell potential - This soil has high shrink-swell potential below the gypsic horizon.  The linear extensibility (LE) of the typical pedon from the soil surface to a depth of 40 inches is 10.34 cm.

Keys to Soil Taxonomy - Soils classified according to the Eighth Edition, 1998.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  The series type location was sampled for full characterization by the National Soil Survey Laboratory (NSSL) as pedon S86NM-045-012. Lab results confirm the presence of a gypsic and a salic horizon.  Also, see: Soil and Range Inventory Report of District 12; USDI-BIA, Shiprock Agency, 1978; pedon number 4657-1.  Salinity values were also determined on three pedons, including the type location, with a Wheatstone bridge.
