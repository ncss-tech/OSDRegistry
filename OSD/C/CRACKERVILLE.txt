CRACKERVILLE SERIES 

The Crackerville series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, residuum and colluvium derived from granitic and other coarse grained igneous rocks.  These soils are on bedrock-floored plains, mountains, escarpments, ridges and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Crackerville loam, bouldery in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

(4 to 17 inches thick) 

    BC--15 to 23 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine and few fine pores; 30 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick) 

    Cr--23 to 31 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) decomposed granite bedrock (grus) which crushes to very gravelly loamy coarse sand or coarse loamy sand. (3 to 18 inches thick) 

    R--31 inches; hard granite bedrock.
