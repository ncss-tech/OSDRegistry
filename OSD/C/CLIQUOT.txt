CLIQUOT SERIES

The Cliquot series consists of deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in colluvium and the underlying residuum from shale or interbedded shale and sandstone on ridgetops and side slopes.  Slope ranges from 3 to 20 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F, mean annual precipation is about 42 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, semiactive, mesic Oxyaquic Hapludults

TYPE LOCATION:  Cedar County, Missouri; about 3 1/2 miles west of Dunnegan; 10 feet east and 5500 feet south of the northwest corner of section 2, T.34 N., R.25 W.; USGS Bearcreek quadrangle; latitude 37 degrees 43 minutes 32 seconds north and longitude 93 degrees 38 minutes 47 seconds west.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Depth to a paralithic contact in shale is 40 to 60 inches.  Rock fragments are sandstone, shale and in a few areas, rounded or subrounded chert.  Soft fragments are weathered shale.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on upland ridgetops and sideslopes. Slope ranges from 3 to 20 percent.  They formed in colluvium and the underlying residuum from shale or interbedded shale and sandstone.  Sandstone fragments and, in areas where conglomerate is present, chert fragments are commonly part of the colluvium.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 55 to 58 degrees and mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 46 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Basehor, Bolivar, Pomme, and Goss soils.  Basehor soils are shallow to a lithic contact and are on side slopes below Cliquot soils.  Bolivar soils have a loamy subsoil, are moderately deep to a lithic contact and are on similar positions.  Pomme soils are very deep, fine-loamy and are on strath terraces and footslopes below the Cliquot soils.  Goss soils are very deep, clayey-skeletal and are on side slopes below the Cliquot soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Runoff is high or very high. Permeability is slow.  In undisturbed areas, a perched water table has an upper limit of 3.5 to 4.5 feet during December to March in most years.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas remain in forest.  Some areas are used for pasture and hayland.  Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods dominated by oak and hickory.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Ozark Border area (MLRA 116B) of southwest Missouri.  It is of medium extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Polk County, Missouri, 1995.

REMARKS:  The laboratory data for the type location show that the particle-size control section averages slightly above 60 percent clay, but an average of all pedons sampled indicate that the representative value is less than 60 percent clay.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 10 inches (A and E horizons).
Argillic horizon - the zone from a depth of 10 inches to 55 inches (2Bt and 2BC horizons).
Paralithic contact - soft shale at 55 inches (2Cr horizon).

In southwestern Missouri, these soils formed exclusively in materials weathered from sandstone, shale, and cherty conglomerate from the Pennsylvanian geology.
