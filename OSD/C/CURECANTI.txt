CURECANTI SERIES

The Curecanti series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits. These soils are on fan remnants, eroded fan-remnant sideslopes, landslides and stream terraces. Slopes are from 0 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 457 mm, and mean annual air temperature is 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Curecanti very stony sandy loam, on a 36 percent concave south-facing slope. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 15 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) very stony sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky; 25 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 23 cm thick)

    Bt1--15 to 28 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very cobbly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak coarse subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 35 percent gravel and cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 18 cm thick)

    Bt2--28 to 58 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/4) very cobbly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, sticky; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 40 percent gravel and cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual smooth boundary. 

    Bt3--58 to 84 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/4) very cobbly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 40 percent gravel and cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual smooth boundary.  (combined thickness of Bt2 and Bt3 horizons is 30 to 85)

    BC--84 to 152 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very cobbly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky; 35 percent gravel and cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8).
