CAMBERT SERIES

The Cambert series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material derived from semiconsolidated loamy sedimentary beds.  These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cambert loam, native grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 4 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick)

    Bw1--4 to 9 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many fine tubular pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.

    Bw2--9 to 13 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); gradual wavy boundary. (The combined thickness of the Bw horizons is 8 to 20 inches)

(6 to 14 inches thick)

    Cr1--21 to 38 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 7/4) semiconsolidated sedimentary beds that crush to silt, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common fine and very fine roots in cracks; common fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt smooth boundary.

    Cr2--38 to 45 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) semiconsolidated sedimentary beds that crush to very fine sandy loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots in cracks; few fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.7); abrupt smooth boundary.

    Cr3--45 to 54 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) semiconsolidated sedimentary beds that crush to silt, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots in cracks; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.9); gradual smooth boundary.

    Cr4--54 to 60 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) semiconsolidated sedimentary beds that crush to silt loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; massive; hard, friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine roots in cracks; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).
