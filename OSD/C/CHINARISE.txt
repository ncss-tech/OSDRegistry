CHINARISE SERIES

The Chinarise series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks and volcanic ash. Chinarise soils are on low stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy, glassy, frigid Vitrandic Haploxerolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Chinarise ashy silt loam--on a one percent slope at an elevation of 1,320--rangeland. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted. When described on August 17, 1998, the soil was dry to 10 cm, moist from 10 to 100 cm, and saturated below 100 cm.) 

   An--0 to 13 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) ashy silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak thin and medium platy structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; about 30 percent sand-size pumiceous ash grains; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.5); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 36 cm thick) 

   Bn1--13 to 23 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) ashy silt loam, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine, common fine and medium roots; many fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2); gradual smooth boundary.

(0 to 38 cm thick) 

  Bw2--74to 127 cm; dark brown (10YR 3/3) ashy fine sandy loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; few fine faint dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist masses of iron accumulation; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (25 to 64 cm thick) 

  C--127 to 152 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) ashy fine sandy loam, light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; common fine faint brown (10YR 5/3) masses of iron accumulation; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Coalbank, Cottonthomas, and Fez, series. None of these soils has endosaturation or redoximorphic features. In addition, Fez soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chinarise soils are on low stream terraces. These soils formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks and volcanic ash. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Elevations range from 1,310 to 1,345 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Morehouse, Paulina, and Tuffcabin soils. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; low surface runoff; moderate or moderately slow permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 60 and 100 cm (moderately deep free water occurrence class) from February through July. Cumulative annual duration class is Common. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Chinarise soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is mainly basin wildrye, inland saltgrass, and rabbitbrush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Oregon. These soils are not extensive with about 6,200 acres of the series mapped to date. MLRA 23.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 46 cm (An, Bn1, and Bn2 horizons). 
Cambic horizon - The zone from 46 to 127 cm (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons). 
Vitrandic intergrade feature - The zone from the soil surface to 76 cm (An, Bn1, Bn2, and Bw1 horizons and part of the Bw2 horizons). 
Endosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 60 and 150 cm at certain times during normal years (parts of the Bw1 Bw2, and C horizons). 
Particle-size control section and ashy substitute class with glassy mineralogy - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Bw1 horizon and parts of the Bn2 and Bw2 horizons). 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Volcanic glass in the Bn2 and Bw2 horizons determined locally by optical grain count using a polarizing petrographic microscope.
