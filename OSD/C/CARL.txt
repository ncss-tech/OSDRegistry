CARL SERIES

The Carl series consists of deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in a thin mantle of silty loess over clayey alluvium over gravelly alluvium.  These soils are on drainageways adjacent to upland streams. Slope gradient ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 14 degrees C (57 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is 102 cm (40 inches).

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Jasper County, Missouri, 1996.  Name taken from a town in the southwest part of Jasper County.

REMARKS:  These soils were formerly included in the Woodson series.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series are:

Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 69 cm, 27 inches.  (Ap and 2Bt horizons)

Argillic horizon - zone from 33 cm to 203 cm, 13 to 80 inches (2Bt and 3Bt horizons).

Intersecting slickensides - the zone from 69 cm to 173 cm, 27 to 68 inches.  (2Btgss horizons)

Chroma of 1 and redox concentrations - the zone from 0 to 203 cm, 0 to 80 inches (Ap, 2Bt,  and 2Btgss1, 2Btgss2, 2Btgss2, 2Btgss3, 2Btgss4  and 3Btg horizons).
