COXPIN SERIES

The Coxpin series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium from igneous rocks. Coxpin soils are on fan remnants and fan aprons over fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters (4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.5 degrees C (71 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, hyperthermic, shallow Cambidic Haplodurids

TYPICAL PEDON: Coxpin loamy fine sand, on an east northeast-facing, convex, 3 percent slope under sparse desert shrubs at an elevation of 329 meters (1,079 feet). When described the soils were dry throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The surface is covered by approximately 15 percent fine gravel, 45 percent medium and coarse gravel and 5 percent cobbles.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Coxpin soils are on fan remnants and fan aprons over fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from igneous rocks. Elevations range from 290 to 780 meters (951 to 2,560 feet). The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 millimeters (3 to 5 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 20 to 26 degrees C (68 to 79 degrees F). The frost-free season is 300 to 340 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aquapeak, Buzzardsprings, Dalelake and Perurose soils. Aquapeak and Buzzardsprings soils are on similar landscape positions, Dalelake soils are on adjacent sandsheets with Perurose soils on adjacent, steeper and well developed fan remnants. Aquapeak soils are shallow and have an argillic horizon above a duripan. Buzzardsprings soils have a calcic horizon and do not have a duripan. Dalelake soils are very deep, are formed in eolian materials and have no diagnostic horizons. Perurose soils are more than 50 centimeters deep to a duripan.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well-drained; medium runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity above and below the duripan and moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity within the duripan.

USE AND VEGETATION: Coxpin soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly creosote bush.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Mojave Desert of southeastern California. MLRA 30. These soils are of small extent.
