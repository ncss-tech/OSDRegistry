CURRYCREEK SERIES

The Currycreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in landslide deposits and colluvium derived from igneous and sedimentary sources.  These soils occur on landslides and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 4 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 700 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic Pachic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Currycreek silty clay loam, forested. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

   Oi--0 to 10 cm; forest litter, slightly decomposed. (3 to 15 cm thick)

   A1--10 to 30 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) silty clay loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate medium and fine granular structure; moderately hard, very friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; many fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.

   A2--30 to 52 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate medium and coarse granular structure; moderately hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.  (combined thickness of A horizons - 30 to 50 cm thick)

   Bt1--52 to 79 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong coarse subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine and medium roots; common fine irregular pores; 45 percent distinct clay films on faces of peds; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary. (15 to 30 cm thick)

   Bt2--79 to 104 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) clay, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common fine irregular pores; 75 percent prominent clay films on faces of peds; slightly acid (pH 6.4) clear wavy boundary. (20 to 35 cm thick)

   BC--104 to 152 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky; moderately hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 6.6).
