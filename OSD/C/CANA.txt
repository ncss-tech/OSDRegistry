CANA SERIES

The Cana series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils formed in a thin mantle of loess and the underlying till material and clayey residuum weathered from shale on glaciated hills.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Coolville, Lansdowne, and Rarden series. Coolville soils have less than 12 percent sand in the upper part of the series control section. Lansdowne soils do not have a paralithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Rarden soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cana soils are on summits, shoulders, backslopes and footslopes on glaciated hills. Slope ranges from 2 to 35 percent. The soils formed in a thin mantle of loess and the underlying till material and clayey residuum weathered from shale. Climate is humid and temperate. Mean annual precipitation ranges 914 to 1118 mm (36 to 44 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 56 degrees F). Frost-free period is 145 to 181 days. Elevation is 210 to 372 meters (690 to 1220 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cincinnati, Hickory, Rossmoyne, Shelocta, and Weikert soils. Cincinnati and Hickory soils are well drained are on similar landscapes. Rossmoyne soils have a fragipan and are on similar landform positions. Shelocta and Weikert soils are well drained and are on steeper unglaciated side slopes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 30 to 91 cm (1 to 3 feet) between January and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is low to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part of the solum and moderately low in the lower part. Permeability is moderate or moderately slow in the upper part of the solum and slow in the lower part.

USE AND VEGETATION: Cana soils are cultivated, pastured and wooded. Principal crops are hay and corn. Native vegetation is mixed, deciduous hardwood forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern and central Ohio; MLRAs 111A and 114A. The type location is in MLRA 114A. The series is of moderate extent.

REMARKS: This soil was previously classified as fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Aquic Hapludults.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 20 cm (Ap horizon).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 20 to 107 cm (Bt, 2Bt, and 3Bt horizons).
