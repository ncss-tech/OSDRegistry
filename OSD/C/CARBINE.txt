CARBINE SERIES

The Carbine series consists of very shallow and shallow to a hardpan, well drained soils that formed in mixed fan alluvium from limestone and calcareous sandstone.  Carbine soils are on fan terraces.  Slopes range from 3 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic, shallow Petrocalcic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Carbine very gravelly loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 20 to 45 percent of the surface is covered with gravel and/or cobble.

    A--0 to 2 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) very gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak thin platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine irregular pores; many distinct calcium carbonate coatings on rock fragments; 40 percent gravel; slightly effervescent, 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 4 inches thick)

    Bk1--2 to 9 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) gravelly fine sandy loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; many distinct calcium carbonate coatings on rock fragments; 10 percent cobble and 20 percent gravel; strongly effervescent, 18 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.

    Bk2--9 to 16 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine irregular and tubular pores; many distinct calcium carbonate coatings on rock fragments; 10 percent cobble and 20 percent gravel; violently effervescent, 27 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bk horizons is 8 to 16 inches)

    Bkm--16 to 60 inches; very hard, strongly cemented petrocalcic horizon; thickness of hardpan varies; loamy alluvium occurs below the hardpan; violently effervescent.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Espy (TX), Kimberson (TX), Ozona (TX), Pitzer (TX) and Queeny (TX) series. Espy, Kimberson, Ozona, and Queeny soils have more than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Espy and Pitzer soils have bedrock below 40 inches.  Kimberson, Ozona, Pitzer and Queeny soils are moist in the soil moisture control section during May and June and occur in the Great Plains.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Carbine soils are on fan terraces at elevations of 4,400 to 6,200 feet.  Slopes range from 3 to 45 percent.  These soils formed in mixed fan alluvium from limestone and calcareous sandstone.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December to February.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 62 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 160 to 210 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Terrarossa, Blacktail, Pyeatt, Gardencan and Lanque soils.  All of these soils are very deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to very rapid runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation includes sideoats grama, black grama, threeawn, and false mesquite.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Arizona.  Carbine soils are of moderate extent.  MLRA is 41.
