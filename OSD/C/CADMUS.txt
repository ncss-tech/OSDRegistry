CADMUS SERIES

The Cadmus series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in glaciofluvial deposits and till on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 9 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C (49 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, semiactive, mesic Oxyaquic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Cadmus loam, on a 1 percent slope in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 20 cm (8 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; friable; many fine roots; about 3 percent gravel; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 inches) thick]

 E--20 to 30 cm (8 to 12 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) loam; moderate coarse granular structure; friable; many fine roots; about 3 percent gravel; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. [0 to 15 cm (6 inches) thick]

 Bt1--30 to 38 cm (12 to 15 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; many fine roots; few faint clay films on faces of peds; about 15 percent gravel; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary.

 Bt2--38 to 61 cm (15 to 24 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) gravelly clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; common fine roots; common faint clay films on faces of peds; about 15 percent gravel; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary.

 Bt3--61 to 76 cm (24 to 30 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) gravelly clay loam; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots; common faint clay films on faces of peds; common medium prominent light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) and grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions; about 15 percent gravel and 2 percent cobbles; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 25 to 69 cm (10 to 27 inches).]

 2Bt4--76 to 86 cm (30 to 34 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; firm; few distinct clay films in pores and on faces of peds; common medium faint brown (7.5YR 4/4) masses of oxidized iron; about 10 percent gravel; slightly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. [0 to 15 cm (6 inches) thick]

 2C--86 to 152 cm (34 to 60 inches); gray (10YR 5/1) loam; massive; firm; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) masses of oxidized iron; about 10 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Ionia County, Michigan; about 4 miles northeast of the village of Elmdale; 1500 feet south and 600 feet west of the northeast corner of sec. 27, T. 6 N., R. 8 W.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Colescreek and Gageville series. Colescreek soils have mica flakes throughout the series control section. Gageville soils are deeper than 91 cm (36 inches) to carbonates.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cadmus soils are on till plains that have a thin covering of glaciofluvial deposits. Slope ranges from 0 to 9 percent. Cadmus soils formed in glaciofluvial deposits and till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 940 mm (29 to 37 inches). Mean annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C (49 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Berville, Conover, Kendallville, Macomb, Miami, and Morley soils. The well drained Kendallville soils, the somewhat poorly drained Macomb soils, and the very poorly drained Berville soils are in the same drainage sequence as the Cadmus soils. The moderately well drained Miami and Morley soils and the somewhat poorly drained Conover soils are on nearby till plains where the outwash thins to a few centimeters or is not present.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The potential for surface runoff ranges from low to high depending on the slope gradient. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderately slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used to grow corn, small grain, beans, and hay. A small part is in permanent pasture or forest. Native vegetation is hardwoods, predominantly sugar maple, shagbark hickory, and white oak.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 98, 99, and 111B in southern Michigan. The type location is in MLRA 98. The series is of moderate extent.
