CAVEMOUNTAIN SERIES

The Cavemountain series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone and dolomite. The Cavemountain soils are on mountains. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 750 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Calcic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Cavemountain gravelly loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is partially covered with approximately 60 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles. 

    A--0 to 8 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine, and few medium interstitial and tubular pores; 4 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 30 percent gravel; very slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  

    ABk--8 to 20 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; strong coarse subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium subangular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine, and few medium roots; common very fine and fine, and few medium interstitial and tubular pores; common (5 percent) secondary calcium carbonate concretions on bottom of rock fragments; 7 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 35 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the A and ABk horizons is 18 to 40 cm) 

    Btk1--20 to 43 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium roots; common very fine and fine and few medium interstitial and tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; common (15 percent) secondary calcium carbonate concretions on bottom of rock fragments; 27 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; strongly effervescent; 35 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  

    Btk2--43 to 68 cm; light brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) very gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots; common very fine and fine, and few medium interstitial and tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; many (20 percent) secondary calcium carbonate concretions on bottom of rock fragments; 20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; strongly effervescent; 40 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Btk1 and Btk2 horizons 30 to 60 cm)

    R--68 cm; indurated limestone bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Hoodling, Latigo, Maciver, Nurkey and Teeler series. Hoodling, Latigo, Maciver, Nurkey and Teeler soils are very deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cavemountain soils are on mountains. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from limestone and dolomite. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent. Elevations are 2,800 to 3,250 meters. The climate is humid with cold wet winters and cool dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 600 to 950 mm. The mean annual temperature is 1.5 to 4 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 30 to 50 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bricone, Kolcheck, and Piar series. 

Bricone soils are shallow to bedrock. Kolcheck soils are somewhat poorly drained and have 2 to 20 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Piar soils are deep to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium or high runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Cavemountain soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. : Cavemountain soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Present native vegetation is big bluegrass, Letterman's needlegrass, whitestem goldenbush, and mountain big sagebrush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: East central Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28B.
