CONDIT SERIES

The Condit series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in loamy till on ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Trumbull series. Trumbull soils average more than 40 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Condit soils are on ground moraines of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 864 to 1067 mm (34 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 13 degrees C (49 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 145 to 180 days. Elevation is 244 to 305 meters (800 to 1,000 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alexandria, Amanda, Bennington, Cardington, Centerburg, and Pewamo soils that are in toposequences with Condit soils. The well drained Alexandria and Amanda soils, the somewhat poorly drained Bennington soils, and the moderately well drained Cardington and Centerburg soils are on higher landscape positions or more sloping areas along drainageways. The very poorly drained Pewamo soils have mollic epipedons and are on similar positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between November and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low. Permeability is slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. Some areas are in pasture or woodland. Corn, soybeans, small grain, and hay are the principal crops. Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 111E and 139 in central and north-central Ohio. The type location is in MLRA 111E. The series is of moderate extent.
