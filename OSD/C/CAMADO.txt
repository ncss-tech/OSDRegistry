CAMADO SERIES

The Camado series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived from shale and sandstone.  Camado soils are on hillslopes.  Slopes range from 5 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 410 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7.8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, smectitic, mesic, shallow Aridic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Camado loam, on a south facing, simple, 17 percent slope in ponderosa pine woodland at an elevation of 2,073 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on July 16, 2003 the soil was dry from 0 to 46 cm.  The surface is covered by 3 percent cobbles.

    A1--0 to 3 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium platy structure parting to moderate fine granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky, slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel, 3 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  

    A2--3 to 8 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium platy structure parting to moderate fine granular; soft, friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few fine and very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel, 3 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of A1, A2 - 8 to 25 cm)

    Bt1--8 to 23 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/3) gravelly sandy clay, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; hard, firm, very sticky, very plastic; few fine and common very fine roots; few fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 15 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.

    Bt2--23 to 46 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/3) gravelly clay, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure parting to moderate fine angular blocky; very hard, firm, very sticky, very plastic; few fine roots; few fine tubular pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (combined thickness of Bt1, Bt2 - 10 to 55 cm)

    Cr--46 to 71 inches; weathered sandstone and shale; neutral (pH 6.8).
