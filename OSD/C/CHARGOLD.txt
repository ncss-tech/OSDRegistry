CHARGOLD SERIES

The Chargold series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in alluvium derived from volcanic ash and mixed sources. These soils are in backswamps on floodplains. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 356 mm, and the average annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Aquandic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Chargold mucky silt loam, on a 1 percent slope at an elevation of 1,126 meters, in drained hayland. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Oe--0 to 6 cm; moderately decomposed plant material from dead roots and stems of grass and grass-like plants; abrupt smooth boundary.

    A--6 to 32 cm; black (10YR 2/1) mucky silt loam; very dark very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; moderate medium angular blocky structure; very firm, very hard, very sticky and very plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.1); abrupt smooth boundary. (25 to 35 cm thick)

    C--32 to 39 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) ashy very fine sandy loam; gray (10YR 5/1) dry; massive; friable, slightly hard, moderately sticky, slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; neutral (pH 6.9); abrupt smooth boundary. (7 to 25 cm thick)

    Ab--39 to 57 cm; black (10YR 2/1) silt loam; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; moderate fine angular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 6.9); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 18 cm thick)

    C'--57 to 76 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) ashy very fine sandy loam, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; massive; friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky, nonplastic; many very fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; neutral (pH 6.9); abrupt smooth boundary. (19 to 42 cm thick)

    A'b--76 to 110 cm; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silt loam; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) dry; moderate medium angular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; 10 percent fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redox concentrations; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.5); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 34 cm thick)

    2Cg--110 to 165 cm; greenish gray (10Y 5/1) coarse sandy loam, light greenish gray (10Y 7/1) dry; massive; friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky and nonplastic; 10 percent fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redox concentrations; 2 percent gravels; few fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; neutral (pH 7.2).
