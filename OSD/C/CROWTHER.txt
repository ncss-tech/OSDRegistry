CROWTHER SERIES

The Crowther series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils formed in loamy over sandy eolian deposits on swales on interdunes on sandhills of the Nebraska Sandhills (MLRA 65). Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the solum and rapid in the underlying material. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 43 centimeters (17 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. (47 degrees F) at the type location. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Calciaquolls

Marlake soils are in depressions on interdunes and are very poorly drained having a seasonal zone of saturation or aquic conditions beginning at the surface and having ponding up to 61 centimeters (24 inches). 
Valentine soils are on higher hummocks and dunes and are excessively drained having no seasonal zone of saturation or aquic conditions.
Wildhorse soils are slightly higher on swales on interdunes, are somewhat poorly drained having a seasonal zone of saturation or aquic conditions beginning at 46 centimeters (18 inches), and have a sodium adsorption ratio greater than 13 in half or more of the upper 51 centimeters (20 inches)

USE AND VEGETATION: The major use is livestock grazing and haying. The rangeland native plant community for the wet subirrigated ecological site (RO65XY023NE) is mostly big bluestem, prairie cordgrass, switchgrass, yellow indiangrass, and tall dropseed; for the wetland ecological site (R065XY022NE) it is mostly prairie cordgrass, northern reedgrass, bluejoint reedgrass, slender wheatgrass, sedges, and rushes.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: In the western sandhills of Nebraska and sandhills of southwestern South Dakota (MLRA 65, LRR G). The series is of moderate extent.
