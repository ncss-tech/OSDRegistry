CASHMONT SERIES

The Cashmont series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial till, glaciofluvial, or alluvial deposits. They are on alluvial fans, till plains, and terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haploxerolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Cashmont sandy loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

  A1--0 to 3 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many roots; few fine pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 7 inches thick) 

  A2--3 to 8 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common roots; few fine pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 12 inches thick) 

  Bw--8 to 23 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common roots; common fine pores; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual smooth boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick) 

  C--23 to 60 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common roots to a depth of 45 inches, few below; few fine pores; 30 percent gravel and cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0). 

TYPE LOCATION: Okanogan County, Washington; 200 feet south and 970 feet west of the center of section 31, T. 31 N., R. 23 E., W.M. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist 
Chroma: 3 through 5 dry or moist 
Texture: gravelly fine sandy loam gravelly sandy loam or gravelly coarse sandy loam
Texture in some pedons below a depth of 35 inches: very gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly coarse sandy loam, very gravelly loamy sand or gravelly sand 
Reaction: neutral or slightly alkaline 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Burch, Calpine, Cashmere, Rio King, Roloff, Roosevelt, and Snake Hollow series. Burch, Calpine and Cashmere soils have less than 15 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section. Roloff and Roosevelt soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Rio King soils are 0 to 10 percent fine gravel in the particle-size control section. Snake Hollow soils are moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline in some part of the control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cashmont soils are on alluvial fans, till plains, and terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent.  The soils formed in glacial till, glaciofluvial, or alluvial deposits of mixed mineralogy.  Elevations are of 700 to 1,800 feet.  They occur in a climate with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.  The mean January temperature is 22 degrees F, mean July temperature is 73 degrees F, mean annual temperature is 48 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 140 to 190 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Cashmere soils and the Aeneas, Farrell, Malott, Peshastin, Pogue, Quincy, Skaha, Strat, and Tonasket soils. Aeneas and Pogue soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal. Farrell, Malott, and Peshastin soils are calcidic. In addition, Peshastin soils are loamy-skeletal. Strat soils are loamy-skeletal. Quincy soils are sandy throughout. Skaha soils are sandy-skeletal. Tonasket soils have a medium textured particle-size control section. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, very slow to medium runoff; moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Irrigated orchard, hay and pasture, cultivated cropland, rangeland, and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is Sandberg bluegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, currant, big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, arrowleaf balsamroot, needleandthread, and silky lupine. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North-central Washington; MLRA 8.  They are of moderate extent.
