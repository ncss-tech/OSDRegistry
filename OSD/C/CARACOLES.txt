CARACOLES SERIES

The Caracoles series consists of very shallow, well drained, moderate to moderately rapidly permeable soils on side slopes and summits of small hills.  They formed in material that weathered from calcareous sandstone.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is 77 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 50 inches.  Slopes range from 5 to 40 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy, mixed, superactive, isohyperthermic Lithic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Caracoles loam--native pasture (Colors are for the moist soil).

     Ap--0 to 6 inches, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam; weak fine granular structure; friable; nonsticky, slightly plastic; many fine roots; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

     R--6+ inches; semiconsolidated calcareous sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION:  Atlantico SCD, Puerto Rico; approximately 50 meters south of Kilometer Marker 6.25 on P.R. Highway 681.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the semiconsolidated sandstone is less than 10 inches.  Reaction is neutral to slightly alkaline throughout.

The A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is sandy loam or loam.

The R horizon consists of semiconsolidated sandstone bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other known series in the same family.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Caracoles soils are on side slopes and small hill tops.  Slopes range from 5 to 40 percent.  They formed in medium-textured residuum that weathered from semiconsolidated calcareous sandstone.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 45 to 55 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 75 to 79 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Islote and San German soils.  Islote soils are on lower positions, are moderately deep, and have Rhodic subsoils.  San German soils are on similar positions, are shallow to limestone, and calcareous and loamy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate to moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of Caracoles soils are used for native pasture.  The vegetation consists of native and introduced grasses and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern humid coastal plains.  The series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Raleigh, North Carolina.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Arecibo Soil Survey Area, Puerto Rico.  Caracoles is the name of a "barrio" or ward near to where this soil was first recognized.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:

Mollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 6 inches (Ap horizon).

Lithic contact - at a 6 inch depth (R horizon).
