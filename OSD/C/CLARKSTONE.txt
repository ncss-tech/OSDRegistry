CLARKSTONE SERIES

The Clarkstone series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess.  These soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Torriorthentic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Clarkstone silt loam, cultivated (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 7 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine, and few medium roots; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 7 inches thick)

    Bw--7 to 9 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 5 inches thick)

    Bk1--9 to 22 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; disseminated lime; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 13 inches thick)

    Bk2--22 to 27 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few fine soft masses of lime; disseminated lime; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.7); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 20 inches thick)

    BC--27 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; disseminated lime; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.7).

Slope - 0 to 15 percent.
Parent material - very deep loess deposits.
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers.
Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 14 inches, much of which falls as snow and spring rains.
Mean annual temperature - 43 to 45 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 95 to 120 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Clarkstone soils are used for nonirrigated small grain.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Clarkstone soils are of small extent in the intermountain valleys in southwestern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Gallatin County Area, Montana, 1997.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1304.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the surface to 7 inches (Ap horizon); a calcic horizon from 9 to 27 inches (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bk1, Bk2, and BC horizons).  Clarkstone soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
