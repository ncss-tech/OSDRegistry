CHEADLE SERIES 

The Cheadle series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and/or residuum derived mainly from hard sandstone, but may be underlain by hard phyllitic shale, argillite, quartzite or igneous rock.  These soils are on bedrock-floored plains, hills, escarpments, mountains and ridges.  Slopes are 2 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Lithic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Cheadle channery loam, grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A1--0 to 7 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) channery loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine and very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, and common medium roots; 25 percent channers; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 8 inches thick) 

    A2--7 to 15 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) extremely channery loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak very fine and fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, and common medium roots; 55 percent channers, 10 percent gravel; pockets of disseminated calcium carbonate and calcium carbonate coatings on undersides of rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (5 to 8 inches thick) 

    Bk--15 to 19 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely channery loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak very fine and fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots in mattings between rock fragments; 55 percent channers, 20 percent gravel; disseminated calcium carbonate and continuous faint calcium carbonate coatings on undersides of fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 8 inches thick) 

    R--19 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) fractured hard sandstone.
