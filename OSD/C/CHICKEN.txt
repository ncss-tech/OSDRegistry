CHICKEN SERIES

The Chicken series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slide deposits derived from mixed igneous and interbedded sedimentary rock.  These soils occur on hills, mountain slopes, ridges and landslides.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 710 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic Vertic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Chicken clay loam, in forest on a 35 percent north slope at an elevation of 2277 meters (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

   Oi--0 to 6 cm; slightly decomposed forest litter; clear smooth boundary. (4 to 8 cm thick)

    A--6 to 21 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, very sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary. (12 to 20 cm thick)

   BA--21 to 39 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, very sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 5 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 20 cm thick)

   Bt--39 to 56 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) gravelly clay loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; strong fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; common fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel; 60 percent prominent continuous clay films on all faces of peds; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary.

   Btss--56 to 84 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) clay, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; strong fine and medium subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; common fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; 60 percent prominent continuous clay films on all faces of peds; 30 percent prominent slickensides; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt wavy boundary. (combined thickness of Bt horizons - 35 to 70 cm)

   Cr--84 to 152 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) interbedded soft and moderately hard sandstone, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; crushes to medium and fine sand.
