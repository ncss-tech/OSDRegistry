COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in the same family.
Closely related series include Gouldsboro and Broadkill soils.
Gouldsboro soils--formed in silty marine sediments and are also found on tidal marshes in estuaries and coastal lowlands. They allow grayer hues, have a frigid soil temperature regime, and are mapped in MLRA 144B.
Broadkill soils--formed in silty estuarine deposits and found on tidal marshes in estuaries and coastal lowlands. They have grayer hues and are underlain by fluviomarine deposits in in MLRAs 149A, 153C, and 153D.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material--Silty estuarine deposits sometimes underlain by clayey glaciomarine deposits.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Great Bay, Ipswich, Pishagqua, Quinnipiac, and Westbrook soils. 
Great Bay soils--have subaqueous drainage and formed in silty estuarine deposits overlying clayey glaciomarine deposits. Found on bays and coves in estuaries.
Ipswich soils--formed in deep deposits of moderately decomposed herbaceous organic matter.
Pishagqua soils--have subaqueous drainage and formed in silty estuarine deposits. Found on lagoon bottoms and lagoon channels in coastal lagoons and bays.
Quinnipiac soils--formed in coarse-loamy alluvium and/or estuarine deposits, have slightly coarser textured materials, and are found on the southern fringe of the MLRA (slightly warmer).
Westbrook soils--formed in moderately decomposed herbaceous organic matter overlying loamy marine or glaciofluvial deposits

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major uses--Most areas are in salt marsh and provide food and habitat for fish, shellfish and wildfowl.
Vegetation--The most common grasses are salt meadowgrass, salt water grass and spike grass. Other vegetation includes blackgrass, sea lavender, saltwort, seaside goldenrod, aster, and purple gerardi. In areas where the 1:5 EC by volume is below 1.5 dS/m, vegetation consists principally of tall reeds and sedges.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
General area--These soils are located along New Hampshire coast.
Land Resource Regions--R - Northeastern Forage and Forest Region

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include: 
Hypersulfidic materials--zone from 0 to 200 centimeters (ACseg and Cseg horizons).
Peraquic moisture regime--positive soil water potential at or near the soil surface.
Particle-size control section--the zone from 25 to 100 centimeters (ACseg and Cseg horizons). 
N-value > 0.7--the zone from 0 to 200 centimeters (ACseg and Cseg horizons).
Fluventic subgroup--An organic carbon content of 3 percent at a depth of 125 centimeters below the mineral soil surface (the Fluventic subgroup will need to be added to the soil series when NASIS and OSD database recognize the choice).
Cocheco soils often overlie the Presumpscot formation which are submarine clay glacial deposits
