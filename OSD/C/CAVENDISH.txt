CAVENDISH SERIES

The Cavendish series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and material weathered from basalt.  Cavendish soils are on hills, ridges, escarpments and benches on basalt plateaus and have slopes of 2 to 50 percent.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.  The average annual precipitation is about 635 mm and the average annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Ultic Haploxeralfs

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Cavendish soils are on hills, benches, ridges, and escarpments on basalt plateaus, at elevations of 335 to 1067 m and have slopes of 2 to 50 percent.  The soils formed in loess and material weathered from basalt.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 610 to 890 mm inches. The frost-free period ranges from 80 to 125 days.  The average annual temperature varies from 4.4 to 7.8 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include Joel, Klickson, Lovell, Setters and Taney soils.  Joel soils are on basalt plateaus, are well drained and have mollic epipedons.  Klickson soils are on canyon sides, are loamy-skeletal and have mollic epipedons.  Lovell soils are in drainageways on basalt plateaus and are somewhat poorly drained. Setters soils are on basalt plateaus and benches, have greater than 35 percent clay in the control section and have mollic epipedons.  Taney soils are on basalt plateaus and benches, are moderately well drained and have mollic epipedons and albic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well-drained; slow to rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for wheat, barley, peas, hay, pasture and timber production.  The natural vegetation is mainly an overstory of Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine.  Understory is common snowberry, mallow ninebark, rose, mountain brome and pine reedgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Clearwater, Latah, Lewis and Nez Perce Counties, Idaho.  The series is not extensive.  MLRAs 9 and 43A.
