CEDRIC SERIES 

The Cedric series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum from granite and other coarse grained igneous rocks.  These soils are on dissected bedrock floored plains, hills and mountains. Slopes are 2 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Argiustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Cedric coarse sandy loam, bouldery, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 5 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) coarse sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 10 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 7 inches thick) 

    Bt--5 to 11 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial tubular pores; common faint dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay films on faces of peds and bridging sand grains; 20 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 8 inches thick) 

    Bk--11 to 15 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; 40 percent pebbles; common fine masses and threads of lime; common distinct lime coatings on fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick) 

    Cr--15 to 18 inches; partially decomposed granitic bedrock (grus) that crushes to very gravelly loamy coarse sand. (2 to 5 inches thick) 

    R--18 inches; hard granite bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Cedric soils are primarily used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, needleandthread, sandberg bluegrass, prairie junegrass, sedges, bitterbrush, Rocky Mountain juniper, rubber rabbitbrush, fringed sagewort and big sagebrush.  Dry phase has blue grama on south and neutral aspects.  Some areas have widely scattered Douglas-fir and limber pine. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Cedric soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.
