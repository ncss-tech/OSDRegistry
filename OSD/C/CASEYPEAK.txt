CASEYPEAK SERIES 

The Caseypeak series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from granite and other coarse grained igneous rocks. These soils are on mountains and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Lithic Haplocryepts 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Caseypeak gravelly coarse sandy loam, bouldery forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 1.5 inches; partially decomposed needles, twigs, and leaves. (1/2 to 3 inches thick) 

    E--1.5 to 6 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine and common medium roots; many very fine and fine and few medium pores; 20 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick) 

    Bw1--6 to 12 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine and common medium roots; many very fine and few fine tubular and interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual wavy boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick) 

    Bw2--12 to 17 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, common fine and few medium roots; many very fine and few fine tubular and interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.7); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick) 

    Cr--17 to 20 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) decomposed granite bedrock (grus) that crushes to very gravelly loamy coarse sand; neutral (pH 6.8). (2 to 18 inches thick) 

    R--20 inches; hard granite bedrock.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Caseypeak soils are primarily used for timber production and wildlife habitat.  The potential native vegetation is mainly Douglas fir, lodgepole pine, pinegrass, white spiraea, common snowberry, russet buffaloberry, common juniper, Kinnikinnick, raceme pussytoes, Oregongrape, heartleaf arnica, rough fescue, and Idaho fescue. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Caseypeak soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Jefferson County, Montana, 1998.  

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1594, MT3070, MT3073. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a layer of partially decomposed needles, twigs, and leaves from 1 1/2 inches to the mineral soil surface (Oi horizon); an ochric epipedon from the mineral surface to 7 inches, mixed (E, Bw horizons); a cambic horizon from 5 to 16 inches (Bw1, Bw2 horizon); a layer of decomposed granite (grus) from 16 to 19 inches (Cr horizon); hard granite bedrock at 19 inches (R horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 16 inches (Bw, Bw2 horizons).  Caseypeak soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime. 

The 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Lithic Eutrocryepts to Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Lithic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.
