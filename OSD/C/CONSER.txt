REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features in this pedon
*Particle-size control section--zone from 36 to 86 cm
*Mollic epipedon--zone from the surface to a depth of 69 cm
*Argillic horizon--zone from 36 to 104 cm
*Aquic conditions--zone from 23 to 150 cm
*Depth to lithologic discontinuity--104 cm

In the Willamette Valley, the Conser soils are on the Winkle geomorphic surface.

Elevation typically is 45 to 185 m in MLRA 2 and 30 to 400 m in MLRA 5. The mean annual precipitation typically is 1000 to 1500 mm in MLRA 2 and 750 to 1500 mm in MLRA 5. The frost-free period generally is 165 to 210 days in MLRA 2. Update projects have been proposed to determine whether the concepts of the Conser series should extend into MLRA 5.
