CLARE SERIES 

The Clare series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loess or other silty material and the underlying loamy stratified outwash on outwash plains, stream terraces, till plains, kames, and eskers. Slope gradients range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C (49 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Assumption, Aviston, Barrington, Blackberry, Buckhart, Catlin, Dana, Danabrook, Geryune, Graymont, Harrison, Keltner, Saybrook, and Totanang series. Assumption, Graymont, and Saybrook soils average more than 20 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section.

Barrington soils have carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Dana, Danabrook, and Geryune soils have a well graded sand fraction in the lower one-half of the series control section. Keltner soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Totanang soils average more than 75 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Clare soils are on loess covered outwash plains, stream terraces, till plains, kames, and eskers of Wisconsinan Age. These soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy stratified outwash. Slope gradients range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 12 degrees C (46 to 53 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 840 to 1,070 mm (33 to 42 inches). Frost free days range from 150 to 195. Elevation ranges from 154 to 311 meters (505 to 1,020 feet) above sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Barony, Brenton, Drummer, Elburn, Millbrook, and Otter soils. The moderately well drained Barony soils are on similar landform positions adjacent to Clare soils and have a dark colored surface layer less than 10 inches thick. The poorly drained Drummer soils are in slight depressions or lower parts of the landform. The somewhat poorly drained Brenton, Elburn, and Millbrook soils are on slightly lower lying landform positions. The poorly drained Otter soils have a mollic epipedon more than 24 inches thick and are on nearby flood plains. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The depth to an apparent seasonal high water table is 61 to 107 cm (2.0 to 3.5 feet) below the surface at some time between February and April in most years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the upper part of the solum and moderately high or high (4.23 to 42.33 micrometers per second) in the lower part of the solum and in the substratum. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and moderate or moderately rapid in the lower part of the solum and in the substratum. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used for cultivated crops. Principal crops are corn, soybeans, small grain, and hay. Some areas are used for pasture. Native vegetation is prairie grasses. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central and northern Illinois. The extent is moderate in MLRAs 95B, 108A, and 108B.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana. 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: DeKalb County, Illinois, 1998. The name Clare is from the town of Clare, in DeKalb County which is near the type location. 

REMARKS: This soil was formerly mapped as Proctor in DeKalb County. Through MLRA update activities these soils were found to be moderately well drained instead of well drained and fit an oxyaquic subgroup rather than a typic subgroup. 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - 0 to 28 cm (0 to 11 inches) (Ap and A horizons); argillic horizon - 36 to 155 cm (14 to 61 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, 2Bt4, 2Bt5, and 2Bt6 horizons); lithological discontinuity at a depth of 81 cm (32 inches) - the contact between the Bt3 and 2Bt4 horizons; udic moisture regime.
