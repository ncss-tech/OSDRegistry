TYPE LOCATION: Chowan County, North Carolina; approximately 2 miles east of Edenton, 0.4 mile north of intersection of State Road 1103 and North Carolina Highway 32, 150 feet west of State Road 1103 in a creek bottom.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Horizon Thickness: The surface mineral horizons range from 16 to 40 inches thick.  The underlying organic horizons range from 16 to more than 80 inches thick 
Depth to Bedrock: Greater than 60 inches
Depth to Seasonal High Water Table: 0 to 6 inches, November to May
Soil Reaction: Extremely acid to moderately acid in the mineral horizons and extremely acid or very strongly acid in the organic horizons
Other Features: Stumps and logs are common throughout the Oa horizon of most pedons

A horizon:
Color--hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Pedons with a horizon that have value less than 3 are less than 10 inches thick.
Texture--silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam

Cg horizon:
Color--hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2
Texture--loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, mucky silt loam, or mucky loam

2Oa horizon:
Color--hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3
Texture--sapric material 16 inches to several feet thick. 

COMPETING SERIES: There are no known competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: Coastal Plain
Landform: Floodplains
Elevation: 2 to 15 feet above mean sea level 
Parent Material: loamy marine sediments
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 61 to 70 degrees
Mean Annual Precipitation: 44 to 51 inches
Frost Free Period: 220 to 280 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
Altavista soils--moderately well drained soils (seasonal high water table 18 to 30 inches) in fine-loamy family on higher adjacent landscapes
Bertie soils--Somewhat poorly drained soils (seasonal high water table 12 to 18 inches) in fine-loamy on higher adjacent landscapes
Chapanoke soils--somewhat poorly drained soils (seasonal high water table 12 to 18 inches) on higher adjacent landscapes
Dogue soils--moderately well drained soils (seasonal high water table 18 to 30 inches) in fine family on higher adjacent landscapes 
Dorovan soils--very poorly drained organic soils (seasonal high water table 0 to 12 inches) with organic layers greater than 51 inches thick on similar landscapes
Perquimans--poorly drained soils (seasonal high water table 0 to 12 inches) on slightly higher adjacent landscapes 
Roanoke soils--poorly drained soils (seasonal high water table 0 to 12 inches) in fine family on slightly higher adjacent landscapes 
State soils--well drained soils (seasonal high water table 48 to 72 inches) in fine-loamy family on higher adjacent landscapes
Wahee soils--somewhat poorly drained soils (seasonal high water table 12 to 18 inches) in fine family on higher adjacent landscapes
Yeopim soils--moderately well drained soils (seasonal high water table 18 to 36 inches) on higher adjacent landscapes

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Agricultural Drainage Class: Poorly drained
Permeability: Moderately slow in the mineral horizons and moderately rapid to moderately slow in the organic horizons. Water covers the surface for six months during most years 

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses: Mostly woodland
Dominant Vegetation: Where wooded--green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), baldcypress (Taxodium distichum), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraviflua), red maple (Acer rubrum), water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica), pond pine (Pinus serotina), and Atlantic white-cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides). Cattails (Typha) and Big Cordgrass (Spartina Cynosuroid) are common in cleared fields.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Distribution: Lower Coastal Plain of North Carolina and Florida, and possibly Virginia, Mississippi, Georgia, and Louisiana.
Extent: Small

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Chowan County, North Carolina; 1982.

REMARKS: The nonacid condition is attributed to surface runoff and erosion of soil this pedon.
