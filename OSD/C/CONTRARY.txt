CONTRARY SERIES

The Contrary series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in deoxidized and leached Wisconsin age loess. These soils are on moderately sloping and strongly sloping side slopes, head slopes, nose slopes, and tops of lowered interfluves on dissected till plains. Slopes range from 5 to 14 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 86 centimeters (34 inches).

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Buchanan County, Missouri, 1984.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters (10 to 40 inches) (BE, Bw1, Bw2, Bw3, Bw4, and BC horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (60 inches) (Ap, BE, Bw1, Bw2, Bw3, Bw4, BC, and C horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 20 centimeters (0 to 8 inches) (Ap horizon);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 36 to 94 centimeters (14 to 37 inches) (Bw1, Bw2, Bw3 and Bw4 horizons);
udic soil moisture regime.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

Taxonomy version--second edition, 1999.

The gray colors described in this pedon were not used in the classification of this soil as they are considered to be inherited from a relict deoxidized and leached weathering zone.
