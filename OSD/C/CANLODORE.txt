CANLODORE SERIES

The Canlodore series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in glacial deposits derived from sandstone and quartzite.  Canlodore soils are on mountainsides.  Slopes range from 15 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 480 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed Typic Cryorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Canlodore very cobbly loamy sand-woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     Oe--0 to 3 cm; partially decayed needles and twigs. (3 to 5 cm thick)

     E--3 to 18 cm; pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) very cobbly loamy sand, light brown (7.5YR 6/3) moist; weak coarse granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 20 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary.  (13 to 30 cm thick)

     EB--18 to 46 cm; pink (7.5YR 7/4) very cobbly loamy sand; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 20 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 30 cm thick)

     Bw--46 to 71 cm; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) very cobbly loamy sand, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 20 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 38 cm thick)

     BC--71 to 101 cm; reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/6) very cobbly sand, reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 25 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 38 cm thick)

     C--101 to 154 cm; pink (7.5YR 7/4) very cobbly sand, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 25 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.2).

TYPE LOCATION:  Moffat County, Colorado; about 55 km west of Powderwash; about 795 meters north and 700 meters east of the southwest corner of Sec. 22, T. 12 N., R. 103 W.; Long. 108 degrees, 57 minutes, 50 seconds W; Lat. 40 degrees, 59 minutes, 09 seconds N.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Mean annual soil temperature--4 to 6 degrees C
Mean summer soil temperature--7 to 8 degrees C

Particle-size control section:
Rock fragment content-- 35 to 60 percent

E horizon
Hue--7.5YR or 10YR
Value--6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist
Chroma--2 or 3
This horizon may or may not meet the requirements of an albic horizon.

B horizon (when present)
Hue--7.5YR or 10YR
Value--5 or 6
Chroma--4 through 6
Reaction--pH 5.6 to 6.5
This horizon is absent in some pedons.

C horizon
Hue--7.5YR or 10YR
Value--6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist
Chroma--3 or 4
Texture--very cobbly loamy sand or very cobbly sand
Reaction--pH 5.6 to 6.5

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alflack (WY), Castlepeak (T)(ID), Chena (AK), Chenega (T)(AK), Cryomont (T)(WY), Graylock (ID), Howardsville (T)(CO), Mirror Lake (UT), Nataga (AK), Nizina (AK), Obscurity (WA), Ovando (MT), Polepatch (WA), Stecum (MT), and Studebaker (WA) series.  Alflack, Castlepeak, Chena, Chenega, Cryomont, Graylock, Howardsville, Nataga, Nizina, Obscurity, Polepatch, Stecum, and Studebaker do not have E horizons.  Ovando soils contain lamellae.  Alflack soils also have bedrock at a depth of 50 to 100 cm.  Mirror Lake soils have strong or very strongly acid soil reactions in the Bw and C horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform-mountain slopes
Elevation--2125 to 2800 meters
Slope--15 to 40 percent
Parent material--glacial deposits derived from sandstone and quartzite
Mean annual precipitation--460 to 510 mm
Mean annual air temperature--3 to 4 degrees C
Frost-free period--50 to 75 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; rapid permeability

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation consists of lodgepole pine with an understory of spike trisetum, blue wildrye, heartleaf arnica, elk sedge, and common juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Canlodore soils are of small extent in northwestern Colorado; MLRA 47.
