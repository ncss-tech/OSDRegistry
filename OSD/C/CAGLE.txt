CAGLE SERIES

The Cagle series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from andesitic rock, metavolcanics, or tuff-breccia.  Cagle soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TYPE LOCATION:  Carson City County, Nevada; in the Pinenut Mountains, about 8 miles east of Prison Hill; approximately 650 feet south of the northwest corner of section 12, T. 14 N., R. 21 E.; USGS Mineral Peak 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 5 minutes 55 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 35 minutes 0 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.0985139 latitude, -119.5834694 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually moist in winter and spring, dry mid-June through October; aridic soil moisture regime that borders on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 12 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 18 to 50 cm.
Depth to base of argillic horizon: 50 to 100 cm.
Depth to bedrock: 50 to 100 cm to a paralithic contact.  The paralithic materials below the contact are weathered volcanic rock such as andesite.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Brownscombe, Bucklake, Correco, Holmzie, Jasseek, Northmore, Perla, Schoer, Sherar, Wicup, and Zymans series.

Brownscombe soils have more than 15 percent coarse sand plus very coarse sand, have 0 to 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section, and have paralithic materials of weathered diorite in the series control section.  Bucklake and Perla soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Correco, Jasseek, Northmore, and Schoer soils are very deep.  Holmzie soils are influenced by volcanic ash with vitrandic intergrade properties in the upper 18 cm.  Sherar soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the particle-size control section, have a component of loess in the parent material, and have an argillic horizon that has very firm consistence when moist.  Wicup soils have identifiable secondary carbonates in the particle-size control section.  Zymans are deep and very deep to bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cagle soils are on hills and mountains.  They typically occur on south and west-facing footslope and backslope positions. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived mainly from andesitic rock, metavolcanics, or tuff-breccia.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 1,225 to 2,135 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Duco and Nosrac soils.  Duco soils are loamy-skeletal and shallow to lithic contacts.  Nosrac soils are loamy-skeletal and occur on north-facing slopes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high surface runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Cagle soils are used for forest land and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is mainly a forest canopy of singleleaf pinyon and Utah juniper with an understory of big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, cheatgrass, Thurber's neddlegrass, and Bottlebrush Squirreltail. This pedon is correlated to ecological site F026XY060NV, PIMO-ARTRV woodland.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada and eastern California.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 26.
