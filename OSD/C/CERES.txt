CERES SERIES

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, semiactive, frigid Typic Hapludults

TYPICAL PEDON: Ceres channery silt loam on a 20 percent slope, in a wooded area. (Colors are for moist soil, unless otherwise noted)

    A--0 to 8 cm (0 to 3 inches), very dark brown (7.5YR 2/2) channery silt loam, brown (7.5YR 5/2) dry; moderate fine granular structure; very friable; many fine and few medium roots; 20 percent rock fragments; extremely acid; clear smooth boundary (5 to 15 cm (2 to 6 inches thick)).

    BA--8 to 18 cm (3 to 7 inches), reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) channery silt loam; strong fine granular structure; very friable; many fine and common medium roots; 15 percent rock fragments; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary (0 to 15 cm (6 inches thick)).

    Bt1--18 to 30 cm (7 to 12 inches); dusky red (10R 3/4) channery silt loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; common fine and few medium roots; few distinct weak red (10R 4/2) clay films on faces of peds; 15 percent rock fragments; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

    Bt2--30 to 56 cm (12 to 22 inches), weak red (10R 4/4) channery silt loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine roots; few distinct weak red (10R 4/2) clay films on faces of peds; 30 percent rock fragments; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

    Bt3 --56 to 74 cm (22 to 29 inches), weak red (10R 4/4) very channery silty clay loam; weak thin platy structure parting to moderate fine angular blocky; friable; few fine roots; few faint weak red (10R 5/3) clay films on faces of peds and on rock fragments; 40 percent rock fragments; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary (combined thickness of the Bt is 30 to 60 cm (12 to 24 inches)).

    C--74 to 112 cm (29 to 44 inches), weak red (10R 4/4) extremely channery silt loam; massive; firm; 75 percent rock fragments; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary (0 to 60 cm (24 inches thick)).

    R--112+ cm (44+ inches), dusky red (10R 3/2) interbedded shale and siltstone.

TYPE LOCATION:
County:  Cattaraugus County
State:  New York
USGS Quadrangle:  Portville
Latitude:  42.029444 N   (NAD 1927)
Longitude:  78.308611 W  (NAD 1927)
Directions to Pedon:  Town of Portville; 610 meters (2,000 feet) northwest of the intersection of Sherry Hill Road and Butternut Brook Road, and 3 meters (10 feet) west of Sherry Hill Road.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Solum thickness:  ranges from 30 to 60 cm (24 to 48 inches).  
Depth to bedrock is 100 to 150 cm (40 to 60 inches).
Rock fragments increase with depth and range from 5 to 25 percent in the surface and BA horizon, from 10 to 40 percent in the Bt horizon and from 60 to 90 percent in the C horizon.  The weighted average, by volume, in the control section averages less than 35 percent rock fragments.
Unlimed, reaction ranges from neutral to extremely acid in the solum and from moderately acid to very strongly acid in the C horizon.

Range of Individual Horizons:
A horizon (Ap if they occur):
Color:  hue:  2.5YR to 7.5YR, value:  2 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  
Texture (fine earth fraction):  silt loam, loam or fine sandy loam.

BA and Bt horizons
Color:  hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Black manganese coatings are on peds in some pedons.
Texture (Fine earth fraction):   BA horizon is silt loam.  Bt horizon is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and less than 40 percent sand.

C horizon:
Color:   hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Black manganese coatings are on surfaces in some pedons.
Texture (Fine earth fraction):  Fine earth texture is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.

COMPETING SERIES: These are no other competing series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Carrollton soils are moderately deep
