CENPLAT SERIES


The Cenplat series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in tephra over residuum from volcanic rock. Cenplat soils are on glacially scoured lava plateaus in the Southern Cascade mountains. Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 53 inches (1346 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F (6 degrees C).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cenplat soils are on glacially scoured lava plateaus in the Southern Cascade mountains. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. These soils formed in tephra over residuum weathered from glacially scoured volcanic rock. Elevation is 6078 to 7364 feet (1853 to 2245 m). Mean annual precipitation is 35 to 65 inches (889 to 1651 mm). The mean annual temperature is 41 to 43 degrees F (5 to 6 degrees C). Frost free season is 60 to 85 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ashbutte and Badgerflat soils. The Ashbutte soils are very deep, and are on cinder cone volcanoes, some of which were the source of the lava flows that formed the Central Plateau. The Badgerflat soils are moderately deep to dense till, and are on plateau backslopes and ground moraines.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; saturated hydraulic conductivity is high to very high in the A and C horizons and high in the 2Bwb horizons.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for wildlife habitat, recreation, ecosystem management, and watershed. Vegetation is California red fir, western white pine, and pinemat manzanita.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The soils are inextensive and are mapped in MLRA: 22B, Southern Cascade mountains
