CRUTCHER SERIES

The Crutcher series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and alluvium over lacustrine deposits.  Crutcher soils are on alluvial flats.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Crutcher soils are on alluvial flats.  These soils formed in volcanic ash and alluvium over lacustrine deposits.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,360 to 1,680 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7.2 to 8.9 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Couch, Emagert, and Pegler soils.  Couch soils are fine and have natric horizons.  Emagert soils have Mollic epipedons and are noncalcareous.  Pegler soils are shallow to tuff and are well drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; low or very low surface runoff; moderate permeability (moderately high or high saturated hydraulic conductivity).  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 83 and 150 cm (deep free water occurrence class) between February and August.  Cumulative annual duration class is Persistent.  These soils are susceptible to rare flooding for very brief periods between November and June.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Crutcher soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly basin wildrye, inland saltgrass, black greasewood, and rabbitbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Nevada and northeastern California.  These soils are not extensive with about 9,000 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 23.
