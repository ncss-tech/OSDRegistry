COMPETING SERIES:  
None

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape:  Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain Estuaries
Landform:  Low-energy mainland coves, fluviomarine and lagoon bottoms
Parent Material:  Fine mainland cove, lagoon bottom, and fluviomarine bottom estuarine deposits
Slope:  0 to 1 percent
Mean Annual Air Temperature:  10 to 13.9 degrees C. (50 to 57 degrees F.)
Mean Annual Water Temperature:  11.1 to 14.4 degrees C. (52 to 58 degrees F.)
Water Regime: Tidal, 1 to 4 feet tidal range

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
Pasture Point soils--are coarse-loamy and are on submerged wave-cut platforms.
Tingles soils--are fine-silty and have lower quantities of clay (<35%) and do not allow thick silty clay loam and silty clay layers.
Trappe soils--are sandy throughout and are on submerged wave-cut platforms.
Truitt soils--are fine-silty soils formed in estuarine deposits that have buried and preserved organic horizons below a depth of 40 inches (1 meter). 
Tumagan soils--have organic horizons greater than within 16 inches (40 centimeters) of the soil surface.
Southpoint soils--are fine-silty soils formed in estuarine deposits of relict marsh sediments, and upland subaerial soils on mainland coves and submerged wave-cut headlands.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage Class:  Subaqueous (permanently submersed)
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity:  Low to moderately low

Soil is permanently submerged with salt or brackish water. The presence of sulfidic material within 50 cm of the soil surface puts these soils at risk for acid sulfate drainage if they are dredged and exposed to the air.

USE AND VEGETATION:  
Major Uses:  Most areas are unvegetated and function as estuarine benthic wildlife habitat.  Benthic fauna such as tubeworms are common.  Benthic fauna such as clams, razor clams, juvenile blue crabs, scallops, oysters and juvenile finfish are rare.
Dominant Vegetation: Native vegetation includes rooted algae, eelgrass (Zostera marina) and Widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima).  Vegetative coverage ranges from 0 to 5 percent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE:  Raleigh, North Carolina.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mid-Atlantic coastal lagoons and estuaries of Delaware (Indian River and Rehoboth Bays), Maryland (Chincoteague Bay), and possibly New Jersey (Barnegat Bay).  This series is of small extent.

SERIES PROPOSED:  Worcester County, Maryland, 2007. The name was taken and used from Danielle Balduff's dissertation for Chincoteague Bay, Maryland.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 6 inches (0 to 15 cm) (A and Ase horizons)
Peraquic feature--Positive soil water potential (permanently submerged) at the soil surface. (under 75 inches (190 cm) of salt water).
Particle size control section--The zone from 0 to 40 inches (0 to 100 cm) (the A, Ase and the Cseg horizons).
Sulfidic materials--a 6 inch (15 centimeter) thick horizon with 20 inches (50 centimeters) of the soil surface that contains sulfidic materials (the Ase, Cseg1 and Cseg2 horizons).
Fluidity Class--the zone from 0 to 83 inches (0 to 210 centimeters) is very fluid.
Fluventic feature--the soil organic carbon is greater than 0.2 percent at a depth of 50 inches (125 centimeters) below the soil surface.
