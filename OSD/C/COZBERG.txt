COZBERG SERIES

The Cozberg series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, glaciofluvial deposits or eolian deposits.  These soils are on stream terraces, hills and till plains.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cozberg fine sandy loam, cultivated.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

    Ap--0 to 7 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots and pores; neutral (pH 7.3); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 8 inches thick)

    Bw1--7 to 12 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; common fine pores; neutral (pH 7.3); clear wavy boundary.

    Bw2--12 to 20 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium and coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common fine and medium pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.  (Combined Bw horizons 10 to 25 inches thick)

    Bk1--20 to 26 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few fine and very fine roots; common fine pores; 5 percent pebbles; few faint lime coatings on surface of pebbles; disseminated lime, slightly effervescent; abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 9 inches thick)

    2Bk2--26 to 30 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) gravelly loamy sand, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; single grained; loose; 20 percent pebbles; disseminated lime; common large masses of lime; continuous distinct crusts on surface of pebbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (4 to 12 inches thick)

    2C--30 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; loose; 10 percent pebbles; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

COMPETING SERIES:

Anaconda (MT) - does not have a lithologic discontinuity.

Chinook (MT) - do not have a discontinuity above a depth of 40 inches.
