CONCONULLY SERIES

The Conconully series consists of moderately deep to dense glacial till, well drained soils that formed in mixed volcanic ash over glacial till.  They are on ground moraines and foothills. Slope ranges from 0 to 65 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Vitrandic Haploxerolls

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil Moisture: These soils are usually moist but are dry for 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice; xeric soil moisture regime.

Soil Temperature: mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F.

Rock fragments: average 10 to 35 percent in the particle-size control section but may range from 5 to 50 percent in individual subhorizons.

Particle-size control section: 3 to 15 percent clay and having a base saturation by ammonium acetate of less than 75 percent in some part (ultic). 

Depth to dense glacial till: 26 to 40 inches

Depth to bedrock: 45 to more than 60 inches

Vitrandic soil properties: an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.50 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 20 to 40 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.15 to 0.40 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.

COMPETING SERIES: These are Deno, Fanal, Phoebe, Safety, Stevens, and Uhlig series. Deno soils are deep to bedrock. Fanel, Phoebe and Uhlig soils are very deep. Safety soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Stevens soils are dry 60 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice and have a 20 to 40 inch thick mollic epipedon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Conconully soils are on ground moraines and foothills. These soils formed in mixed volcanic ash over glacial till. Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. Elevation ranges from 1,200 to 4,000. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 15 inches. The mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 71 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free season is 110 to 165 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Disautel, Ewall, Haley, Nespelem, Picard, Synarep, Timentwa soils. Disautel have secondary carbonates above the densic contact.  Nespelem soils have a duripan.  Synarep soils are very deep.  Timentwa soils are deep and very deep to bedrock.  Ewall soils are sandy.  Haley soils are very deep.  Picard soils are very deep. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to rapid runoff; moderate over slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Nonirrigated cropland, livestock grazing, irrigated hay, pasture, and cropland. Native vegetation is Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, common yarrow, arrowleaf balsamroot, Wyeth eriogonum, silky lupine, antelope bitterbrush, and threetip sagebrush.
