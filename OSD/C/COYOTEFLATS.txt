COYOTEFLATS SERIES

The Coyoteflats series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium derived from mixed sources. These soils occur on fan remnants, stream terraces, escarpments and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcidic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Coyoteflats loam, in rangeland on a 2 percent slope at an elevation of 1865 meters (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

Potrio (CO) - have a lithic contact at depths of less than 102 cm

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform - fan remnants, stream terraces, escarpments and hills
Elevation - 1450 to 2075 meters
Slope - 0 to 35 percent
Parent material - mixed alluvium or colluvium
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers
Mean annual precipitation - 250 to 360 mm
Mean annual air temperature - 4 to 7 degrees C.
Frost-free period - 70 to 100 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Dyce, Bronec, Geohrock and Varney soils. The Dyce soils are moderately deep, fine textured soils and occur on adjacent hills.  The Bronec and Geohrock soils are loamy-skeletal and the Varney soil is fine-loamy; all are very deep alluvial soils and occur on similar landforms.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Coyoteflats soils are used mainly for rangeland and wildlife habitat. Potential native vegetation is mainly mountain and Wyoming big sagebrush, rabbitbrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Poa (species), and miscellaneous forbs and half-shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coyoteflats soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.  MLRAs - 43B, 44B.
