CHAYSON SERIES

The Chayson series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium and loess derived from extrusive igneous rocks and volcanic ash.  They are on terraces, benches, tablelands, plug domes and buttes. Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the average annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Durixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Chayson loam--on a northwest-facing slope of 2 percent under rangeland vegetation at 1,746 meters elevation.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.  When described on July 15, 1982, the soil profile was dry.)

    A--0 to 10 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 20 cm thick)

    Bt1--10 to 28 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds and in pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (13 to 33 cm thick)

    Bt2--28 to 56 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds and in pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); abrupt smooth boundary.  (20 to 43 cm thick)

    Bk--56 to 74 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 20 percent duripan gravel size fragments; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt wavy boundary.  (10 to 53 cm thick)

    Bkqm--74 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) fractured duripan, light gray (10YR 7/2) moist; massive, extremely hard, extremely firm; many continuous indurated laminations throughout the duripan; intermittent layers of noncemented material occur at intervals of 20 to 60 cm; fractures are about 0.6 cm wide, about 36 cm apart and contain few very fine roots; violently effervescent.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Ibola and Northcastle series.  Ibola and Northcastle soils lack carbonates in the profile.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Chayson soils are on terraces, benches, tablelands, plugdomes, and buttes.  The slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in mixed alluvium and loess derived from extrusive rocks and volcanic ash.  Elevations are 1,525 to 1,850 meters.  The average annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm.  The average annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 70 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Acord, Aninto, Chen, Bancy, Budlewis, Howcree, Hutchley, Merlin, Oshone, Paynecreek, Tanner, and Vipont soils.  Acord, Aninto, and Howcree soil are very deep and have a clayey-skeletal particle-size control sections.  Chen soils are shallow to bedrock.  Bancy soils are shallow to a duripan.  Budlewis, Merlin, Oshone, and Tanner soils have fine particle-size control sections.  Paynecreek soils are deep and very deep.  Vipont soils are moderately deep to bedrock and have a Pachic mollic epipedon. Acord, Aninto, Bancy, Budlewis, Howcree, Oshone, and Tanner soils are on terraces.  Bancy, Budlewis, Oshone, and Tanner soils are generally on lower terraces.  Howcree soils are on higher terraces.  Chen, Hutchley, and Vipont soils are on mountainsides. Paynecreek soils are on dissected stream terraces.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained, medium runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Chayson soils are used mainly for rangeland, wildlife habitat, and dry cropland.  Dominant natural vegetation is Idaho fescue, western wheatgrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, mountain big sagebrush, and basin big sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South central Idaho and northern Nevada.  Chayson soils are of moderate extent. MLRA 25.
