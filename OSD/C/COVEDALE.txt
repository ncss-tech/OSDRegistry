COVEDALE SERIES

The Covedale series consists of very deep, well drained soils on upland side slopes, toe slopes, and foot slopes.  These soils formed in colluvium and/or residuum weathered from black, fissile shale.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 2 to 55 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 44 inches and average annual temperature is 54 degrees F near the type location.

COMPETING SERIES:  The Branson series was formerly in the same family, but has not been updated to 8th Edition standards.  The Branson series formed in old alluvium or a thin mantle of loess over alluvium or residuum of limestone.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Covedale soils are on side slopes, toe slopes, and foot slopes or uplands.  Slopes range from 2 to 55 percent.  Covedale soils formed in colluvium and/or residuum weathered from black fissile shale of the Ohio Shale Formation, Devonian Geologic System and from the Sunbury Formation, Mississippian Geologic System in Kentucky.  Elevations are 560 to 1200 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Colyer and Trappist soils.  Colyer soils are shallow to black shale bedrock and have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Trappist soils are moderately deep to black shale bedrock and have more than 35 percent clay in the control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is moderately slow in the subsoil and slow in the substratum.  Runoff class is medium on gentle slopes, high on strong and moderately steep slopes, and very high on steeper slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used primarily for timber production and wildlife habitat.  Some gently sloping and sloping areas are in row crops, hayland, or pasture.  Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods such a hickory, red maple, flowering dogwood, sourwood, American beech, and oak species.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Covedale soils are in the Knobs region of Kentucky (western rim of MLRA 125); possibly in southern Indiana (MLRA 122); and southeastern Ohio (MLRA 124).  This series is moderately extensive (17,855 ac. in Lewis Co., KY).

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lewis County, Kentucky, 1998.  Source of name is a former school in northwestern Lewis County.

REMARKS:  Covedale soils were proposed to fit the colluvial landforms that were previously mapped as Muse (fine).  The 4/99 revision places Covedale soils in an active CEC activity class based on estimates from the SIR and from lab data.  Rock fragment content ranges were also modified to better fit the fine-silty definition.

Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:  

Ochric epipedon - from a depth of 0 to 7 inches (Ap horizon).

Argillic horizon - from a depth of 7 to 67 inches (Bt/A, Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons). 

Low pH and a base saturation of less than 35 percent at 125 cm below the upper boundary of the argillic horizon (Ultisol Soil Order).

Does not have lithic, paralithic, or petroferric contact within 150 cm of the mineral soil surface and does not have a clay increase with increasing depth of 20 percent or more (relative) from the maximum clay content (Paleudult Great Group).
