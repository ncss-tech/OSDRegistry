CARETT SERIES 

The Carett series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium derived from semiconsolidated tuff. These soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces.  Slopes are 15 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy, glassy, frigid Vitrandic Argiustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Carett very cobbly ashy silty clay loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 9 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) very cobbly ashy silty clay loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 20 percent pebbles and 30 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.(8 to 12 inches thick) 

    Bt1--9 to 15 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) cobbly ashy silty clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; few medium tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent pebbles and 15 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual smooth boundary. (6 to 14 inches thick) 

    Bt2--15 to 24 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) cobbly ashy silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and common fine roots; few medium tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 10 percent pebbles and 15 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 14 inches thick) 

  Cr--24 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) semiconsolidated tuff that crushes to silt loam.

Landform - alluvial fans and stream terraces. 
Elevation - 4,000 to 6,300 feet. 
Slope - 15 to 35 percent. 
Parent material -  alluvium or colluvium derived from semiconsolidated tuff. 
Climate - long, cold winters; cool, moist springs; warm summers. 
Mean annual precipitation - 15 to 19 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, moderately slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Carett soils are primarily used for rangeland.  The potentional native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue and rough fescue. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Carett soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Granite County, Montana, 1997. 

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record MT1519.  Diagnostic  horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: a mollic epipedon from the surface to 15 inches (A and Bt1 horizons); an argillic horizon from 9 to 24 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons); a paralithic contact at 24 inches (Cr horizon); a particle size control section from 9 to 24 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).  Carett soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
