CADERO SERIES

The Cadero series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum from weakly consolidated ash.  These soils are on shoulders, summits, and upper backslopes of hills with north-facing aspects.  Permeability is moderately rapid. Slopes range from 8 to 35 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Ashy, glassy Vitrandic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:   Cadero ashy fine sandy loam, rangeland; on a 35 percent north facing slope at 6,200 feet elevation.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 5 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) ashy fine sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine and few medium and coarse roots; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 5 inches thick)

    Bw1--5 to 14 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) ashy fine sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine and few medium and coarse roots; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 9 inches thick)

    Bw2--14 to 25 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) paragravelly ashy fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; 15 percent paragravel that have thin lime coats on bottoms of fragments in a noncalcareous matrix; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (8 to 11 inches thick)

    Cr--25 to 35 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/1) weakly consolidated ash.

TYPE LOCATION: Bear Lake County, Idaho; about 2 miles northwest of Bennington, Idaho; about 2,600 feet east and 2,400 feet north of the southwest corner of section 1, T. 12 S., R. 43 E.; USGS Nounan Quad;  (42 degrees 24 minutes 28.4 seconds north Latitude and 111 degrees 22 minutes 35.4 seconds west Longitude.)

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Brownsbowl (T) series. Brownsbowl soils are very deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform: summits, shoulders and upper backslopes of hills in the Salt Lake Formation, with north-facing aspects.
Elevation: 6,000 to 7,700 feet
Slope: 8 to 35 percent
Parent Material: residuum from weakly consolidated ash
Climate: long, cool winters; dry, warm summers
Average annual precipitation: 14 to 20 inches
Average annual temperature: 37 to 42 degrees  
Frost-free season: 50 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Hoopgobel (T), Burchert (T), and Brushtop (T) soils.  Hoopgobel soils have an argillic horizon on backslopes and shoulders.  Burchert soils are moderately deep to weakly consolidated ash and have a warmer soil temperature regime on backslopes and shoulders.  Brushtop soils are deep to weakly consolidated ash on backslopes and footslopes.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for wildlife habitat and rangeland.  The dominant native vegetation is mountain big sagebrush, serviceberry, mountain snowberry, buckwheat, Idaho fescue, Sanberg bluegrass, prairie junegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho. The series is not extensive.
