CANARWAY SERIES 

The Canarway series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on stream terraces or flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Aeric Fluvaquents 

TYPICAL PEDON: Canarway gravelly sandy loam, in pasture (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oe--0 to 5 cm; moderately decomposed organic matter. (0 to 8 cm thick) 

    A--5 to 15 cm; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) gravelly sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, and common medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 13 cm thick) 

    C1--15 to 25 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly coarse sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. 

    C2--25 to 30cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel; slightly alkaline; (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of C1 and C2 horizons is 10 to 30 cm) 

    2C3--30 to 152 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; many fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redox concentrations; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; 35 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained; moderately rapid permeability to 30 cm and very rapid below. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Canarway soils are used mainly for pasture and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is alder, water birch, willow, cottonwood, sedges, rushes, tall reedgrass, and tufted hairgrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Canarway soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana. MLRAs 43B, 44A, 44B.
