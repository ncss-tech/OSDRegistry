CALLVILLE SERIES


The Callville series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from gypsiferous sandstone and siltstone. Callville soils are on pediments. Slope ranges from 8 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, active, hyperthermic Leptic Haplogypsids

TYPICAL PEDON: Callville fine sandy loam--wildlife habitat. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered with approximately 5 percent pebbles. 

	Ay--0 to 2 inches; red (2.5YR 5/6) fine sandy loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; moderate medium and thick platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine interstitial and few fine tubular pores; 5 percent pebbles; 5 percent fine and medium crystals of secondary gypsum; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 5 inches thick) 

	By1--2 to 15 inches; red (2.5YR 5/6) gypsiferous fine sandy loam, dark red (2.5YR 3/6) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 5 percent pebbles; 15 percent fine threads and fine and medium crystals of secondary gypsum; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. 

	By2--15 to 25 inches; red (2.5YR 5/6) gravelly gypsiferous fine sandy loam, dark red (2.5YR 3/6) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 25 percent pebbles; 15 percent fine threads and fine and medium crystals of secondary gypsum; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the By horizons is 19 to 35 inches.) 

	Cr--25 to 43 inches; red (2.5YR 5/6) gypsiferous sandstone, dark red (2.5YR 3/6) moist; massive; soft, highly fractured; few very fine roots in fractures; clear wavy boundary. (15 to 25 inches thick) 

	R--43 inches; gypsiferous sandstone; hard, slightly fractured. 

TYPE LOCATION: Clark County, Nevada; about 0.4 mile west of Elephant Rock along Nevada State route 169 in the Valley of Fire State Park; 2,400 feet south and 2,000 feet west of the northeast corner of section 26, T. 17 S., R. 67 E.; USGS Valley of Fire East 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; 36 degrees 25 minutes 36 seconds north latitude and 114 degrees 28 minutes 1 second west longitude; UTM 11s 0727088e, 4034040n, NAD 27. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil moisture - Usually dry, moist in some part for short periods during winter and early spring and for brief periods between July and October following convection storms; typic aridic moisture regime. 

Mean annual soil temperature - 72 to 76 degrees F. 

Depth to gypsic horizon - 1 to 5 inches. 

Depth to bedrock - 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact. The paralithic materials below the contact are soft, weathered sedimentary rocks such as gypsiferous sandstone and siltstone. Hard bedrock is typically within 40 to 60 inches. 

Control section - Clay content: 5 to 18 percent.

Rock fragments: Averages 5 to 25 percent, mainly gravel. Lithology of fragments is dominantly siltstone and sandstone. 

Reaction - Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. 

Ay horizon - Hue: 2.5YR through 7.5YR. 

Value: 4 through 5 dry, 2.5 through 4 moist. 

Chroma: 4 or 6, dry or moist. 

Gypsum content by weight of the less than 20 millimeter fraction: 1 to 10 percent. 

By horizons - Hue: 2.5YR through 7.5YR. 

Value: 2.5 through 6 dry; 2.5 through 4 moist. 

Chroma: 2 through 6, dry or moist. 

Texture: Gypsiferous sandy loam, gypsiferous fine sandy loam, gravelly gypsiferous fine sandy loam, or gravelly gypsiferous sandy loam. 

Rock fragments: 0 to 35 percent gravel.

Structure: Subangular blocky or massive. 

Electrical conductivity:: 2 to 4  dS/m. 

Sodium Adsorption Ratio: 0 to 1. 

Gypsum content by weight of the less than 20 millimeter fraction: 15 to 25 percent. 

Secondary gypsum: Occurs as 15 to 30 percent by volume segregated throughout matrix as fine threads and fine and medium crystals. 

COMPETING SERIES: At present, there are no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Callville soils are on pediments. These soils formed residuum derived from gypsiferous sandstone and siltstone. Slope ranges from 8 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 1,200 to 2,100 feet. The climate is arid with warm, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 5 inches, mean annual temperature is 69 to 73 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 300 to 340 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Baseline soil. Baseline soils are loamy-skeletal, have carbonatic mineralogy and calcic horizons. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; high runoff; moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly desert holly, creosotebush and white bursage. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southern Nevada. MLRA 30. These soils are not extensive. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: PHOENIX, ARIZONA

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Clark County Area, Nevada, 2006. Proposed in  Clark County, Nevada, 2000. The name is from a local feature. 

REMARKS: The active cation exchange activity class is estimated. Laboratory data is needed to confirm this placement. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

Ochric epipedon - 0 to 2 inches (Ay horizon). 

Gypsic horizon - 2 to 25 inches (By1 and By2 horizons). 

Paralithic contact - 25 inches (Cr horizon). 

Lithic contact  43 inches (R horizon). 

Particle-size control section - 10 to 25 inches (By2 horizon and part of the By1 horizon). 

ADDITIONAL DATA: The typical pedon of Callville was reference sampled and analyzed at the Utah State University Analytical Laboratories. Selected chemical properties such as soil reaction (pH), electrical conductivity, sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), gypsum content, and water soluble ions were determined. USU Sample # 2719-2722, 1997. 

Responsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 4/2015. The last revision to the series was 7/2006. ET
