CRATERS SERIES

The Craters series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in reworked ash and cinders. Permeability is moderate. These soils are on fan terraces and along mountain valley drainages.  Slopes are 1 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Medial, amorphic, frigid Humic Vitrixerands

TYPICAL PEDON: Craters very gravelly medial sandy loam, rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

	A1--0 to 4 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly medial sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and medium roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 35 percent gravel-size cinders; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 8 inches thick)

	A2--4 to 10 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very medial gravelly sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and medium roots; common medium, many very fine and fine tubular pores; 45 percent gravel-size cinders; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 12 inches thick)

	Bw1--10 to 22 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly medial sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; many fine and medium tubular pores; 35 percent gravel-size cinders; neutral (pH 7.3); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick)

	Bw2--22 to 38 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly medial sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; many fine and medium tubular pores; 25 percent gravel-size cinders; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (12 to 20 inches thick)

	Bw3--38 to 60 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) gravelly medial sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; many fine and medium tubular pores; 20 percent gravel-size cinders; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5).

COMPETING SERIES: These are no competing.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Craters soils are on fan terraces and  along mountain valley drainage. Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent. They formed in reworked ash and cinders. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 18 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is about 60 to 90 days. Elevation ranges from 5,500 to 6,000 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Goodalfs soil. Goodalfs soils are moderately well drained and are in adjacent depressions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for rangeland and recreation. The potential natural vegetation is mountain big sagebrush, basin wild rye, and Idaho fescue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Idaho. The series is of small extent.
