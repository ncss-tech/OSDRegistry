MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Queen Anne's County, Maryland, 1995. 

REMARKS: Corsica soils were formerly included in the Pocomoke series. It is distinguished from Pocomoke by having more than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section, and having a mesic temperature class. 
Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Umbric epipedon--the zone from 5 to 30 cm  (A horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 46 to 102 cm  (Btg1 and Btg2  horizons)
Aquic conditions--the zone from 5 cm  to a depth of 203 cm is periodically saturated (endosaturation)
