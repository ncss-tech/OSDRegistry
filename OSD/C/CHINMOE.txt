CHINMOE SERIES

The Chinmoe series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from mudstone, shale, and sandstone.  Chinmoe soils are on homoclinal ridges, cuesta.  Slopes range from 5 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 381 millimeters (15 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (43 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Chinmoe clay loam - Rangeland; 20 percent slope at an elevation of 1931 meters (6372 feet).  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  

     A--0 to 2.5 inches (0 to 6 cm); reddish brown (5YR 5/4) gravelly loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3), moist; 8 percent clay; moderate thin platy parts to moderate very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; many very fine roots; 20 percent gravel; noneffervescent; slightly acid, pH 6.4.

     Bt1--2.5 to 6.5 inches (6 to 16 cm); dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/3) loam, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 2.5/3), moist; 25 percent clay; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, moderately plastic; common very fine roots and fine roots; few distinct clay films; 5 percent gravel; noneffervescent; neutral, pH 6.6.

     Bt2--6.5 to 15.5 inches (16 to 39 cm); dark reddish brown (2.5YR 2.5/4) clay, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 2.5/4), moist; 41 percent clay; strong medium angular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky, very plastic; common very fine roots and fine roots; few prominent clay films; 5 percent gravel; noneffervescent; neutral, pH 6.8.

     Bt3--15.5 to 42 inches (39 to 107 cm); dark red (2.5YR 3/6) clay, dark red (2.5YR 3/6), moist; 40 percent clay; strong medium angular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky, very plastic; common medium roots and very fine roots and fine roots; few prominent clay films; 5 percent gravel; noneffervescent; neutral, pH 6.8.
