CLOUDYWAY SERIES


The Cloudyway series consists of very deep, well drained soils with moderately rapid permeability that formed in alluvium from granitic rocks. Slopes range from 4 to 15 percent in mountain valleys. The average annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the average annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.
 
TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Cumulic Ultic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Cloudyway fine gravelly sandy loam, forested -- on a 5 percent slightly convex northeast-facing slope at 3,125 feet elevation. When described on October 21, 1997, the soil was slightly moist throughout. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     Oi-- 0 to 1 inch; slightly decomposed forest litter.

     A1-- 1 to 4 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine gravelly sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine, few medium roots; many very fine and fine, few medium irregular pores; 20 percent fine gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary. 

     A2--4 to 9 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine gravelly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine, few medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular and irregular pores; 20 percent fine gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear smooth boundary.

     A3--9 to 18 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine, few medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 25 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.7); clear smooth boundary. (combined A horizon - 15 to 30 inches thick)

     AC--18 to 24 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 25 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 20 inches thick) 

     C1--24 to 43 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine irregular pores; 30 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 24 inches thick) 

     C2--43 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) gravelly loamy sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine irregular pores; 30 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.1). 

TYPE LOCATION: Boise County, Idaho; about 6 miles north of Crouch; 1,200 feet north and 400 feet east of the southwest corner of section 13, T.10 N., R.4 E.; USGS Pyle Creek Quadrangle; Latitude - 44 degrees, 11 minutes, 44 seconds N. and Longitude - 115 degrees, 56 minutes, 12 seconds W.; NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

C horizon
Value - 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma - 3 or 4 dry or moist
Texture - SL, COSL, LS or LCOS
Clay content - 5 to 12 percent
Rock fragments - 15 to 35 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent cobbles and 15 to 35 percent total

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Boise and Staircase series. Boise soils are moist less than 90 consecutive days when the soil temperature is greater than 47 degrees F (aridic bordering xeric) and do not have O horizons. Staircase soils are moderately well drained with redox concentrations at 40 to 60 inches below the surface and a seasonal high water table during April through June.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cloudyway soils are moderately to strongly sloping on alluvial fans at elevations of 2,750 to 3,650 feet. These soils formed in alluvium from granitic rocks. Slopes range from 4 to 15 percent. The average annual precipitation is 20 to 26 inches. The average annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F. The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Stardust and competing Staircase soils. Stardust soils are fine-loamy, have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick and occur on similar geomorphic positions. Staircase soils occur on swales.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Cloudyway soils are used mainly for irrigated pasture/hayland. Some areas are used for timber production or homesites. Native vegetation is ponderosa pine, antelope bitterbrush, bluebunch wheatgrass and Lemmon needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West-central Idaho. MLRA 43 and 44. Cloudyway soils are of small extent.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
Mollic epipedon with irregular decrease in organic matter - zone from 1 to 24 inches (A1, A2, A3 and AC horizons)
Particle-size control section - zone from 11to 41 inches 
Soil moisture regime  xeric

All depths to diagnostic horizons and features within the range of characteristics are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.
