CURDLI SERIES

The Curdli series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in calcareous lake sediments dominated by diatomaceous earth.  These soils have moderate permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, carbonatic, mesic Typic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Curdli loam, rangeland.  (Colors are for air dry soils otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 4 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak thin platy structure that parts to weak fine granular structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; common fine vesicular pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 7 inches thick)

    Bk1--4 to 14 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) loam; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine, few medium roots; common fine and few medium tubular pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)

    Bk2--14 to 24 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) silt loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist; moderate thick platy structure; very hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; few fine roots; few fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)

    Bk3--24 to 60 inches; white (10YR 8/1) silt loam, very pale brown (10YR 8/2) moist; massive; very hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  Millard County, Utah; 19 miles southwest of Hinckley, 1/2 mile south of Highway 50-6; NE1/4 section 4, T.19S., R.10W.; lat. 39 degrees 11 minutes 41.76 seconds N. and long. 112 degrees 58 minutes 32.38 seconds W., NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 51 to 54 degrees F.  The soil moisture regime is Typic Aridic.

Depth to the horizon of carbonate accumulation ranges from 3 to 10 inches.  Mineralogy is carbonatic and is dominated by diatomaceous earth.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 40 to 55 percent.  The control section ranges from loam to silt loam with 18 to 27 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 7 or 8 dry, 5 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline.

The Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 through 8 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Curdli soils are nearly level floodplains, lake plains, and low terraces at elevations of 4,550 to 4,700 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in very strongly calcareous mixed lake sediments dominated by diatomaceous earth.  The climate is arid, with an average annual precipitation of 6 to 8 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 49 to 52 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature ranges from 70 to 73 degrees F.  The frost free season is 115 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Goshute, Hiko Springs, and Yenrab soils.  Goshute soils have natric horizons.  Hiko Springs soils are gravelly in the control section.  Yenrab soils are fine sand or sand throughout the control section.  All of these soils have less than 40 percent carbonate.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used as rangeland for livestock.  Vegetation is shadscale, budsage, halogeton, and seepweed.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  West central Utah, Millard County.  This series is inextensive. MLRA 28A.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Millard County (Delta Area), Utah, 1970.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features that are recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface on the soil to 4 inches. (A horizon)

Calcic horizon - the zone of carbonate accumulation from 4 to 60 inches.  (Bk1, Bk2, and Bk3 horizons)

Carbonatic mineralogy - the particle size control section averages more than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.
