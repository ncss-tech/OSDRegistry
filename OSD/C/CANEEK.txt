CANEEK SERIES

The Caneek series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained and poorly drained soils formed in 50 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) of stratified, calcareous, silty alluvium and in the underlying silty alluvium.  These soils are on low stream terraces and floodplains.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C (about 47 degrees F).  Mean annual precipitation is about 810 millimeters (about 32 inches).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Aeric Fluvaquents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Caneek silt loam, on a west-facing slope of about 1 percent, in a pasture.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak thin platy structure; friable; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. [0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches) thick]

 Cg1--15 to 41 centimeters (6 to 16 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam that has thin dark gray (10YR 4/1) and brown (10YR 5/3) strata; massive with weak thin alluvial stratification; friable; common fine iron and manganese oxide concretions; common fine prominent reddish brown (5YR 4/4) redoximorphic concentrations; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.

 Cg2--41 to 81 centimeters (16 to 32 inches); stratified dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), dark gray (10YR 4/1), and very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam; massive with weak thin alluvial stratification; friable; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) iron and manganese oxide concretions; common fine prominent reddish brown (5YR 4/4) redoximorphic concentrations; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Cg horizon is 35 to 102 centimeters (14 to 40 inches).]

 Ab--81 to 127 centimeters (32 to 50 inches); black (10YR 2/1) silt loam; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) in the lower part; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; friable; neutral; clear smooth boundary. [38 to 152 centimeters (15 to 60 inches) thick]

 Bb--127 to 203 centimeters (50 to 80 inches); dark gray (10YR 4/1) silt loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; neutral.

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are pastured or cultivated.  Where drained, the principal crops are corn, soybeans, small grains, and legume hays.  The native vegetative cover is a mixed herbaceous and woody community commonly inhabited with Eastern Cottonwoods, Black Willows, Silver Maples, Green Ashes, American Sycamores, Rice Cutgrasses, Grays Sedges, Bushy Cinquefoils, Nodding Beggarticks, Swamp Docks, and Calico Asters.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters (10 to 39 inches) (Cg1, Cg2and 2Ab horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (0 to 59 inches) (Ap, Cg1, Cg2, 2Ab and 2Bb horizons). 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches) (Ap horizon);
aquic moisture regime.

Irregular decrease of organic carbon content with increasing depth.

Aeric subgroup based on dominant value of 4 or less without redoximorphic concentrations in the upper 50 centimeters (20 inches).

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
