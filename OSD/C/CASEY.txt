CASEY SERIES

The Casey series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in stratified glacio-lacustrine or marine sediments. Casey soils are on terraces and have slopes of 0 to 10 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Vertic Endoaqualfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Casey silty clay loam - pasture. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted. All textures are apparent field textures.)

 Ap--0 to 8 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine and very fine roots; strongly acid (pH 5.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick)

 Btg1--8 to 18 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay, light gray (10YR 7/1) dry; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redox concentrations, yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) dry; moderate coarse and medium angular blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; many fine and very fine roots; common very fine irregular and many very fine tubular pores; common moderately thick clay films in pores and on faces of peds; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 12 inches thick)

 Btg2--18 to 29 inches; dark gray (5Y 4/1) silty clay, gray (5Y 6/1) dry; common medium prominent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) redox concentrations, brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) dry; moderate coarse and medium angular blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine irregular and common very fine tubular pores; many moderately thick clay films in pores and on faces of peds; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 14 inches thick)

 Btg3--29 to 36 inches; olive gray (5Y 5/2) silty clay, light gray (5Y 7/1) dry; common medium prominent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) redox concentrations, brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) dry; weak coarse and medium angular blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine irregular and few very fine tubular pores; common moderately thick clay films in pores; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 9 inches thick)

 Cg--36 to 60 inches; olive (5Y 5/3) silty clay loam, light gray (5Y 7/2) dry; massive; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.4).

TYPE LOCATION: Clallam County, Washington; approximately 9 miles SW of Port Angeles; 220 feet N and 800 feet W of the SE corner of sec. 32, T. 30 N., R. 7 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The particle-size control section contains 0 to 10 percent gravel. The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 47 to 52 F. It is assumed the soil to a depth of 40 inches has a linear extensibility of 2 to 3 inches.

The Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 4 moist, 5 through 7 dry; and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry. It has granular and subangular blocky structure. This horizon is slightly acid to strongly acid.

The E horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 moist; and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. This horizon is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam. It has subangular blocky or platy structure. It is slightly acid to strongly acid.

The Btg horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 6 moist, 5 through 8 dry and chroma of 1 through 4 moist and dry. It has few to common distinct redox features. It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay with 35 to 55 percent clay. It has angular blocky or prismatic structure. It is moderately acid to neutral.

The Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 through 6 moist, 5 through 8 dry and chroma of 1 through 4 moist, 1 through 3 dry. It is clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam, stratified with strata or sandy loam and loamy fine sand. It has 35 to 55 percent clay.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Casey soils are on terraces at elevations of near sea level to 600 feet. Slopes are 0 to 10 percent. The soils formed in stratified glacio-lacustrine or marine sediments. The climate is characterized by cool, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Average annual precipitation is 18 to 50 inches. Average January temperature is about 39 degrees F., average July temperature is about 60 degrees F. and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F. The frost-free season (32 degrees F.) is 160 to 200 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Agnew, Alderwood, Clallam, Elwha, Everett, Indianola, McKenna, Neilton, and Semiahmoo soils. Agnew soils are fine-loamy. Alderwood soils have a cemented layer at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Clallam, Elwah, and McKenna soils have a densic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Everett soils are sandy-skeletal. Semiahmoo soils are Histosols.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained; slow runoff; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Timber production, pasture, and hay are the principal uses. Native vegetation is predominantly Douglas-fir with some bigleaf maple, western redcedar, western hemlock, red alder, and willow. Understory species are salal, red huckleberry, blackberry, oceanspray, horsetail, bedstraw, Indian plum, salmonberry, western swordfern, and western brackenfern.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Washington; MLRA 2. Series is of small extent.
