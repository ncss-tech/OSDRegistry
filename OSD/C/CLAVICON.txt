CLAVICON SERIES

The Clavicon series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in colluvium and residuum from limestone and dolomite.  These soils are on mountainsides.  Slopes range from 30 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, active, frigid Typic Calcixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Clavicon very gravelly loam--woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 5 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and medium granular structure; soft, very friable, sticky and plastic; many very fine, fine and common medium roots; 30 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; moderately calcareous; carbonates are disseminated; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual smooth boundary.

    A2--5 to 13 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, sticky and plastic; many fine, medium and common coarse roots; many very fine, fine and common medium pores; 35 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; moderately calcareous (15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are soft coats; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); diffuse smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the A horizons is 7 to 18 inches.)

    Bk1--13 to 20 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, sticky and plastic; many very fine, medium and common coarse roots; many very fine, fine and few medium pores; 35 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; strongly calcareous (20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); secondary carbonates segregated as coats; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.

    Bk2--20 to 30 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few fine and common medium roots; common very fine and fine pores; 30 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; strongly calcareous (40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), secondary carbonates segregated as coats and nodules; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); diffuse smooth boundary.

    Bk3--30 to 38 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; few fine and common medium roots; common very fine and fine pores; 30 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; strongly calcareous (30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); very strongly alkaline (pH 9.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bk horizons is 13 to 26 inches).

    R--38 inches; fractured, weathered limestone.

TYPE LOCATION:  Box Elder County, Utah; 1/2 mile south of Emigrant Pass, Utah; 100 feet east and 200 feet north of the SW corner of sec.  7, T. 9 N., R. 16 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 18 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  Mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist about 50 to 60 percent of the time the soil temperature at 20 inches is above 41 degrees F.  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 5 to 16 inches.  The particle size control section averages 12 to 18 percent clay, 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate, and 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.

The A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3. It has 20 to 40 percent gravel, 0 to l0 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.  The A horizon is slightly calcareous to moderately calcareous and slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.

The Bk horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is very gravelly loam, extremely gravelly loam.  It is moderately calcareous to very strongly calcareous and moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bezzant, Cedarhill (T) and Dennot series.  Similar soils in different families are the Lizzant, Munk, and Sterling series.

The Bezzant, Cedarhill (T) and Dennot soils are very deep.  Lizzant soils have carbonatic mineralogy.  Munk and Sterling soils have mesic temperature regimes.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Clavicon soils are on mountainsides at elevations of 5,400 to 6,500 feet.  Slopes range from 30 to 60 percent and face all directions.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from limestone and dolomite.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is l3 to l6 inches. The freeze-free period is 75 to l00 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Kunzler, Lembos, Lundy and Solak soils.  The Kunzler soils have 15 to 25 percent durinodes within 24 inches and are on lower, flat and concave portions of bajadas. The Lembos soils have a duripan within 40 inches and are on upper flat and slightly convex portions of bajadas.  The Lundy soils are shallow to bedrock, and average more than 40 percent calcium carbonate in the calcareous class control section and are on steep hillslopes.  Solok soils are shallow to bedrock and are on convex mountainsides.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for wildlife habitat, woodland, rangeland, and recreation.  The natural vegetation is dominantly pinyon pine, black sagebrush, juniper and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Utah and southern Idaho.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 28A.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - The zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 13 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).

Calcic horizon - The zone from 13 to 38 inches (Bk1, Bk2, and Bk3 horizons).


The active cation exchange activity class was added to the taxonomic classification in December 2002 based on soil property data.  The remainder of this document has not been completely updated.
