COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cranberryslough soils.
Cranberryslough soils do not have a reduced matrix in the permafrost horizon and occur on hillslopes and saddles at elevations below 300 m (985 ft).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Elevation: 800 to 1200 meters (2625 to 3935 ft)
Parent material: mossy organic material over gravelly colluvium
Landform: mountain slopes

Mean annual precipitation: 350 to 400 mm (14 to 16 in)
Mean annual air temperature: -4 to -2 degrees C. (25 to 28 degrees F)
Frost free period: 40 to 75 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ahtell, Chakina, and Schleyer soils. 
Ahtell soils are well drained, lack permafrost, have folistic and umbric epipedons, and occur on hill tops, and hillside positions.
Chakina soils are somewhat poorly drained, have a cryoturbated horizon, and occur along perennial streams on mountain slopes.
Schleyer soils are somewhat excessively drained, have an albic horizon, and occur in mountain valleys and on fan remnants.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class: poorly drained
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity:  high in the O and Cg horizons, is moderately high in the Bg horizon, and low in the Cf horizon
Permeability: Moderately rapid in O and Cg horizons, moderate in the Bg horizon, and very slow in the Cf horizon
Runoff: very high

Use: wildlife habitat, recreation, and subsistence
Native vegetation: Resin birch and crowberry

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 228 Interior Alaska mountains.
Extent: limited
