CAMAC SERIES

The Camac series consists of well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that are moderately deep to siltstone.  Camac soils formed in alluvium derived from quartzite, and residuum derived from siltstone and shale on risers of high stream terraces.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes range from 15 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Typic Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON: Camac very cobbly fine sandy loam - on the riser of a high stream terrace sloping 43 percent to the west at 4,950 feet elevation--urban buildup area.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described, the pedon was moist from 0 to 12 inches and dry below.)

(3 to 9 inches thick)

   2C--22 to 31 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) clay loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; platy rock structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common fine and very fine roots; few very fine horizontal pores; 60 percent soft siltstone fragments; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 9 inches thick)

   2Cr--31 to 60 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) thinly interbedded siltstone and shale bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competitors.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Camac soils are on risers of high stream terraces.  They formed in alluvium derived from quartzite and residuum derived from Cretaceous siltstone and shale.  Slopes are 15 to 60 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,600 to 5,100 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain from high intensity thunderstorms between July and October.  The mean annual temperature is 51 to 54 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 140 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Blackston, Fruitland, Kimbeto, Mesa, and Tocito soils.  Blackston, Kimbeto and Mesa soils are very deep and occur on adjacent treads of high stream terraces.  Fruitland and Tocito soils are very deep, lack diagnostic horizons and occur on fan terraces.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Camac soils are used for livestock grazing and urban development.  Present vegetation is galleta, Indian ricegrass, alkali sacaton, cheatgrass, shadscale, castle valley clover and small cacti.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Camac soils are of moderate extent in the San Juan River valley, Navajo section of the Colorado Plateau in northwest New Mexico and southwest Colorado.  LRR-D; MLRA 35.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Shiprock Area, Parts of San Juan County, New Mexico and Apache County, Arizona; 1993.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 3 inches.  (A horizon)

Cambic horizon - The zone from 3 to about 12 inches.  (Bw horizon)

Paralithic contact - The presence of soft sedimentary bedrock at about 31 inches.  (2Cr horizon)

ADDITIONAL DATA: Salinity values were determined on three pedons including the type location, with a Wheatstone bridge.  Calcium carbonate equivalence determined with a field volume calcimeter.
