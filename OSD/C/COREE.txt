GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Belhaven, Cipre, Engelhard, Flyway, Great Ditch, Machapunga, and Newholland soils.
Belhaven soils--are in very poorly drained areas on flats, depressions, and flood plains in the Lower Coastal Plain; these soils formed in highly decomposed organic matter underlain by loamy marine deposits.
Cipre soils--are on permanently submerged wave-cut platforms and lake beds in the coastal plain; these soils formed in woody organic material underlain by sandy lacustrine deposits.
Machapunga soils--often do not have buried A horizons and color vlaues moist of 3 or less in the upper 18 centimeters.
Engelhard soils--are in poorly drained lake-wash rims along Lake Mattamuskeet, these soils formed in sandy lacustrine lake-wash deposits that contain a high content of very fine sand and are underlain by marine or fluvial deposits.  
Flyway and Great Ditch soils--are on permanently submerged wave-cut platforms and lake terraces in the coastal plain, these soils formed in sandy lacustrine deposits.
Newholland soils--are on very poorly drained broad upland flats and along the outer edges of pocosins or flood plains in the coastal plain; these soils formed in loamy marine and fluvial deposits.

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses--Most areas are unvegetated and function minimally as littoral and limnic habitat. Recreational use is waterfowl, hunting, and observation; historically, there was extensive fishing and boating. There are no known commercial uses.

REMARKS: 
Coree is derived for the Coree Native American tribe who once occupied a coastal area south of the Neuse River. By 1715, some Coree merged with the Algonquin Machapunga and Tuscarora people and settled in the village of Mattamuskeet along the original shoreline of Lake Mattamuskeet.
