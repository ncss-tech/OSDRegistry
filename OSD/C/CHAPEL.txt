CHAPEL SERIES

The Chapel series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous, clayey lacustrine deposits of Quaternary age. These nearly level soils are on the floor of playa basins. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 483 millimeters (19 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (60 degrees F).

TYPE LOCATION: Lynn county, Texas; from the intersection of Farm Road 2053 and Farm Road 1054, 10.4 miles east of O'Donnell, then 2.5 miles east on County Road, 0.7 mile north on private road, then 220 ft east in playa basin; Latitude: 32 degrees, 59 minutes, 9.9 seconds N; Longitude: 101 degrees, 36 minutes, 17.8 seconds W; Indian Canyon NE, Texas USGS quad; NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: An ustic moisture regime bordering on udic. The soil cracks and 
is dry more than 90 but less than 150 cumulative days in normal years. July 
through August and November through March are the driest months. These soils are 
intermittently moist in September through October and April through June. These 
soils receive runoff and the soil moisture control section is moist for longer 
periods than that of the surrounding upland soils. 
Mean annual soil temperature: 15 to 18 degrees C (59 to 64 degrees F). 
Depth to secondary calcium carbonate: 13 to 76 cm (5 to 30 in). 
Depth to calcic horizon: 50 to 100 cm (20 to 40 in). 
Depth to slickensides: 10 to 50 (4 to 20 in). 
Solum thickness: more than 203 cm (80 in). 
Particle-size control section: 40 to 50 percent silicate clay. 
This is a cyclic soil and undisturbed areas have gilgai microrelief with 
microknolls 5 to 10 in higher than microdepressions. Distance between the 
center of the microknoll and the center of the microdepression is about 5 to 15 
ft. The microknoll makes up about 25 percent, the intermediate, or area 
between the knoll and depression, about 50 percent, and the microdepression 
about 25 percent. Cracks open and close each year except during higher than 
normal rainfall years, and remain open less than 150 cumulative days during most 
years. When dry, 1 to 8 cm wide (0.4 to 3 in) cracks extend from the surface to a depth 
of 100 cm (40 in) or more. Cracks are more prominent in the microdepressions. COLE 
greater than 0.08. Where redox features exceed 3 percent, they occur in less 
than 25 percent of each pedon. The range in characteristics represents 50 
percent or more of each pedon unless otherwise stated.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Dreyer, Frelsburg and Latium series. Similar soils 
also include the Cedarlake, Lazbuddie, Lockney, McLean, Ranco, Randall, 
Sparenberg, and Yellowlake series. 
Dreyer soils: have gypsum and a layer of interbedded shale between 100 and 203 cm (40 to 80 in). 
Frelsburg and Latium soils: have an ochric epipedon and are formed in weakly 
cemented calcareous clays and marls of Tertiary age. 
Cedarlake and Yellowlake soils: have a sodium adsorption ratio (Sodium Adsorption Ratio) greater 
than 13.

Ranco and Randall soils: have aquic conditions and do not have a calcic horizon. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: calcareous, clayey lacustrine deposits of Quaternary age. 
Landform: playa floor 1.5 to 15 m (5 to 50 ft) below the surrounding plain and range in size from 5 to more than 50 acres. 
Slopes: range from 0 to 1 percent. 
Mean annual air temperature: 14 to 17 degrees C (57 to 62 degrees F). 
Mean annual precipitation: 432 to 533 mm (17 to 21 in).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the similar Ranco and Sparenberg 
series and the Arch, Drake, Estacado, Midessa, Pep, Posey, and Portales series. 
Ranco and Sparenberg soils are on similar landscape positions. 
Arch, Midessa, Pep, and Portales soils are on slightly higher landscape 
positions and have less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control 
section. 
Drake soils are on eolian dunes and have less than 35 percent clay in the 
particle-size control section. 
Estacado and Posey soils are on higher landscape positions and have an argillic horizon. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Very slow permeability. Surface runoff is negligible on less than 1 percent slopes. These soils occasionally pond for brief to long periods. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for rangeland and some cropland. Many areas are planted to wheat in the fall and utilized for livestock pasture during the winter months. During dry years, some areas are cultivated to cotton or grain sorghum. Vegetation varies according to amount of water available. It includes western wheatgrass, buffalograss, blue grama, vine mesquite, Texas blueweed, kochia, western ragweed, cocklebur, sunflower, and mares-tail. Bur ragweed, sedges, spike rush, bushy knotweed, frog-fruit, and saltmarsh aster may occur in wetter areas. This soil has been correlated to the Playa (077CY027TX) range site in MLRA-77. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern High Plains of western Texas and eastern New Mexico (sub-MLRA-77C). The series is of minor extent.
