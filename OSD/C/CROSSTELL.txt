CROSSTELL SERIES

The Crosstell series consists of deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey residuum derived from claystone. These nearly level to strongly sloping soils are on shoulders and backslopes of ridges on hills. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C (66 Degrees F).
