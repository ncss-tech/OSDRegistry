CLAPPER SERIES

The Clapper series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic rocks. Clapper soils are on fan remnants, hillslopes, and mesas. Slopes range from 1 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

Potential native vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, galleta, needleandthread, Indian ricegrass, bud sagebrush, winterfat and shadscale. This soil has been correlated to the Semidesert Loam (Wyoming Big Sagebrush) (034XY205UT) range site at the type location in Utah.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern and central Utah, western Colorado, and Wyoming; LRR D, MLRA 34 and 35; This series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Big Horn county, Montana, 1970.

REMARKS: Type location was moved from Yellowstone County, Montana to Uintah County, Utah.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section - from 10 to 40 inches (Bk1 through Bk4 horizons)
Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 3 inches (A horizon)
Calcic horizon - from 7 to 60 inches (Bk1, Bk2, Bk3, Bk4, and Bk5 horizons)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

Taxonomic version:  Eighth Edition, 1998.
