Missak soils have thick organic deposits, are very poorly drained, and occur in depressions associated with the beach plains.
Olds soils have histic epipedons, andic properties, are poorly drained, and occur on flood plains associated with the beach plains.
Pasagshak soils lack marine sediments in the substratum and occur on drainageways and flood plains derived from glacial till and outwash.
Sa soils have thick organic deposits, are very poorly drained, and occur in depressions associated with the beach plains.
Salonie soils have outwash parent material, are poorly drained, and occur on flood plains associated with beach plains.
Yukuk soils have andic properties, are poorly drained, and occur on flood plains associated with beach plains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage class: moderately well drained
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: moderately high to high in the A1 horizon, high in the A2, and very high in the C horizons.
Permeability: moderately in the C1 horizon and moderately rapid to rapid in the A2 horizon, and rapid to very rapid in the C horizons.
