CHIQUITA SERIES

The Chiquita series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium and/or loess of Holocene age over the Ogallala Formation of Miocene-Pliocene age.  These soils are on gently to strongly sloping stream terraces and stream terrace remnants on hillslopes of the Southern High Plains, Breaks (MLRA 77E).  Slope ranges from 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 520 mm (20 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).
