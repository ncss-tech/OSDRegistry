MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Marion County, South Carolina; 1975.

REMARKS:  Decision made in 2000 that saturation is typically below 40 inches. Now referring to the 2-chroma colors in the E horizons above 40 inches as stripped sand grains.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to 58 inches (Ap, E1, E2, and E3 horizons)
Albic horizon - the zone from 36 to 58 inches (E3 horizon)
Spodic horizon - the zone from 58 to 72 inches (Bh1 and Bh2 horizons)
