CROCKETT SERIES

The Crockett series consists of soils that are deep to weathered shale of Cretaceous age.  They are moderately well drained, and very slowly permeable.  These soils are on broad ridges on the dissected plains.  These nearly level to moderately sloping soils formed in alkaline residuum derived from interbedded shale and clay.  Slopes are dominantly 1 to 5 percent, but range from 0 to 10 percent.

Crosstell and Kurten soils: have hue of 7.5YR or redder in the upper part of the Bt horizon.  
Navo soils: do not have an abrupt textural change between the A and B horizons.  In addition, Axtell, Navo, and Tabor soils: also have sola from 152 to greater than 203 cm (60 to greater than 80 in). 
Zulch soils: have sola 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 in) thick.  
Normangee soils: do not have an abrupt textural change between the A and Bt horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: residuum derived from weathered alkaline shale of Cretaceous age interbedded with sandier materials, mainly of Cretaceous age
Landscape: broad nearly level to moderately sloping ridges and plains on dissected plains
Slope: 0 to 10 percent, but are mostly between 1 and 5 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 635 to 1,143 mm (25 to 45 in)
Mean annual air temperature: 16.7 to 21.1 degrees C (62 to 70 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 230 to 276 days
Elevation: 61 to 263 m (200 to 863 ft)
Thornthwaite P-E Index: 50 to 75

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Axtell, Bonham, Burleson, Mabank, Normangee, Payne and Wilson series.  
Bonham soils: have mollic epipedons and have sola greater than 152 cm (60 in). 
Burleson soils: are clays throughout with slickensides.  
Mabank and Wilson soils: are dominated by chromas or 2 or less.  
Axtell, Bonham, Normangee, and Payne soils: are on similar landscapes with Crockett soils.  
Burleson, Mabank, and Wilson soils: are on lower positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Permeability is very slow.  Runoff is low on slopes less than 1 percent, medium on 1 to 3 percent slopes, high on 3 to 5 percent slopes, and very high on 5 to 10 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for growing cotton, grain sorghums, and small grain, but more than half the acreage is now in pastures. Native vegetation is prairie grasses such as bluestems, indiangrass, switchgrass, and gramas, with scattered elm, hackberry, and mesquite trees.

Note: Crockett and Axtell soils are close competitors.  Native vegetation of Crockett was dominantly prairie grasses whereas that of Axtell was trees with an understory of grasses.  Morphologically, Crockett soils are less acid and leached in the upper part of the Bt horizon than Axtell soils.  At present, this difference is attributed primarily to vegetation.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mainly in the Blackland Prairies of Texas (MLRA 86A, 86B, 87A) but minor areas are in Oklahoma.  The series is extensive.
