CARRYBACK SERIES

The Carryback series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from basalt, andesite, and tuff. Carryback soils are on tablelands and have slopes of 0 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Vertic Palexerolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Carryback silty clay loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

  A1--0 to 8 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak thin platy structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine roots; many very fine vesicular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 10 cm thick)

   2Bt1--18 to 28 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/2) clay; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine roots; few faint clay films; 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 20 cm thick) 

   2Bt2--28 to 43 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/2) clay, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films; 5 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 25 cm thick) 

   2Bt3--43 to 61 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; strong fine and medium prismatic structure parting to strong fine blocky; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; many faint clay films; 5 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary. (18 to 30 cm thick) 

    3R--61 cm; basalt. 

TYPE LOCATION: Harney County, Oregon; about 5 miles southwest of Venator in the SE1/4 NE1/4 NE1/4 section 26, T. 26 S., R. 35 E.; latitude 43 degrees, 17 minutes, 19 seconds N and longitude 118 degrees  22 minutes  13 seconds W; NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: Usually dry for one-half to three-fourths of the time when the soil temperature is greater than 5 degrees C; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C. 
Depth to bedrock: 50 to 100 cm. 
Mollic epipedon: 18 to 48 cm thick and may or may not include the upper part of the argillic horizon
Other features: There is an absolute clay increase of 15 to 25 percent between the A and 2Bt horizon. 

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 40 to 60 percent.

Organic matter content:  1.0 to 3.0 percent.
Boundary: Abrupt or clear.
Reaction:  Neutral or slightly alkaline.

2Bt horizon
Hue:  10YR or 7.5YR
Value:  4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist 
Chroma:  2 through 4, dry or moist
Texture:  Silty clay, clay, gravelly clay or gravelly silty clay

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Booth, Campcreek, Crowcamp, Golars , Hankins, Jesh, Joenchris, Kidnapspring, Lacrol, Longbarn , Meaufun , Peaviner , Tippett, Warpaint, and Zumwalt series. 

Booth, Campcreek, Crowcramp, Golars, Hankins, Jesh, Jonchris, Kidnapspring, Lacrol, Longbarn, Meaufin, Peaviner, Tippett and Zumwalt soils  have a xeric soil moisture regime. Warpaint soils are greater than 150 cm to bedrock and have; vitrandic subgroup properties 18 to 33 cm thick

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The soils are on tablelands at elevations of 1,220 to 2,015 meters. Slopes are 0 to 50 percent. The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from basalt, andesite and tuff. The climate is characterized by cold moist winters and hot dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 400 mm. The mean annual temperature is 4 to 8 degrees C. The frost-free period is 50 to 80 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Doyn, Lambring, Ninemile, and Madeline soils. Doyn soils are loamy and very shallow. Lambring soils are deep and loamy-skeletal. Ninemile and Madeline soils are shallow to bedrock. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: The soils are used for livestock grazing. Vegetation commonly is low sagebrush, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Sandberg bluegrass. Where the A horizon is thicker and depth to the claypan is increased, big sagebrush replaces low sagebrush in the plant community. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southcentral Oregon; MLRA 23. The series is extensive.
