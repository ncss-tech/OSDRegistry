CHICOSA SERIES

The Chicosa series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in coarse alluvium on terraces, fans and fan remnants.  Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Calciustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Chicosa gravelly loam, on a north facing, 12 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 6060 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on November 11, 1985 the soil was moist from 0 to 20 inches. The surface is covered by 15 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles.

  A--0 to 6 inches (0 to 15 cm); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 15 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent (3 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 6 inches thick)

  Bw--6 to 20 inches (15 to 51 cm); light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very gravelly loam, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 40 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent (7 percent calcium carbonate); moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (10 to 15 inches thick)

  2Bk--20 to 37 inches (51 to 94 cm); very pale brown (10YR 8/3) extremely gravelly sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; very hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common masses and filaments of lime; 55 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles;  strongly effervescent (18 percent calcium carbonate); moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (12 to 24 inches thick)

  2C--37 to 72 inches (94 to 183 cm); brown (10YR 5/3) extremely gravelly loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; loose, loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 60 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent (4 percent calcium carbonate); moderately alkaline.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Las Animas County, Colorado, 2007. Las Animas and parts of Huerfano County soil survey area, Colorado.  The name is from a major drainage in the area.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (Part of the Bw, 2Bk, and part of the 2C horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 6 inches.  (A horizon)
Cambic horizon:  The zone from 6 to 20 inches.  (Bw horizon)
Calcic horizon:  The zone from 20 to 37 inches.  (2Bk horizons)
Lithologic discontinuity:  At 20 inches. (2Bk and 2C horizons) 

Remarks:  This soil was determined to have a consistent cambic horizon and lithologic discontinuity, separating this from the Ildefonso series.  In addition, the soil moisture regime was determined to be dominantly aridic-ustic.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
