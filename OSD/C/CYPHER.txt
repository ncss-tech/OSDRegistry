CYPHER SERIES

The Cypher series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed from acid igneous rocks on convex mountain sides and ridge crests.  Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cypher gravelly loam--forested.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi & Oe--1 inch to 0; decomposed and undecomposed forest litter. (1 to 3 inches thick)

    A--0 to 4 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky parting to weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, common medium and coarse roots; many fine interstitial pores; 15 percent pebbles; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick)

    Bw--4 to 13 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist weak very fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common medium and coarse roots; few fine tubular pores; 40 percent pebbles; medium acid; gradual wavy boundary. (8 to 10 inches thick)

    C--13 to 19 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable; common medium and coarse roots; common medium tubular pores; 50 percent pebbles; medium acid; abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 6 inches thick)

    2R--19 inches; intrusive acid igneous bedrock fractured in the upper few inches and with some soil material in cracks.

TYPE LOCATION:  Colfax County, New Mexico; about 11 miles north-northwest of Eagle Nest; 2,690 feet south and 550 feet east of the junction of State Highway 38 and the Taos County line.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Temperature:  40 to 44 degrees F. with mean summer soil temperature 49 to 53 degrees F.

Depth to bedrock:  10 to 20 inches

Rock Fragments:  mostly pebbles, 5 to 60 percent in the surface horizon, 40 to 85 percent in underlying horizons.

Reaction:  medium acid to slightly acid

A horizon:  Hue - 7.5YR or 10YR Value:  2 through 5 dry, 2 through 4 moist Chroma:  2 through 4 Texture:  loam or sandy loam

Bw horizon:  Hue - 7.5YR or 10YR Value:  5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist Chroma:  2 through 4 Texture:  sandy loam or loam (10 to 25 percent clay)

C horizon:  Hue - 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist Chroma: 2 through 4 Texture:  sandy loam or loam (10 to 25 percent clay)

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cinnadale and Sharrott soils. Cinnadale soils have hues redder than 7.5YR and are neutral.  Sharrott soils are moist for longer periods of time in the spring and early summer.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Cypher soils are on convex mountain sides and ridge crests at elevation of 6,900 to 10,500 feet.  Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in material weathered from acid igneous rocks.  The climate is continental with an annual temperature of 38 to 45 degrees F. and a summer temperature of 47 to 51 degrees F. Precipitation is 18 to 23 inches with about 60 percent falling during the frost-free period.  The frost-free period is less than 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Abreu, Bundo, and Moveno soils.

These soils have argillic horizons and lack a lithic contact at depths less than 20 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Wildlife habitat, recreation, woodland, and watershed.  Vegetation is Douglas-fir, white fir, limber pine, and scattered ponderosa pine.  Understory is kinnikinnick, Oregon grape, Arizona fescue, Junegrass, mountain muhly and mountain brome.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern New Mexico and possibly Colorado. This series is of moderate extent.
