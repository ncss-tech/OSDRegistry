CABINET SERIES

The Cabinet series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in stratified glaciolacustrine sediments with a thin mantle of volcanic ash. These soils are on stream terraces, lake plains and lake terraces in valleys. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 34 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cabinet soils are on stream terraces, lake plains and lake terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent. They formed in stratified glaciolacustrine sediments with a thin mantle of volcanic ash. Elevations are 2,100 to 2,800 feet. Average annual precipitation is 28 to 38 inches, average annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F., and the frost free period is 90 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dewberry (T), Fernline (T), Hoodoo, Wrencoe, and Pywell. Dewberry soils are ashy over loamy-skeletal. Fernline soils are in a fine family. Hoodoo soils have a thick mantle of volcanic ash and have an ashy particle-size class. Wrencoe soils lack an argillic horizon. Pywell soils are organic soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained; slow runoff on gentle slopes and rapid on steeper slopes; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Cabinet soils are used mainly for timber   production, grazing, hay and pasture, recreation, and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is mainly western red cedar, western white pine, western larch, western hemlock, grand fir, Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine, quaking aspen, and paper birch. Understory vegetation is mainly spirea, serviceberry, creambush oceanspray, willow, Columbia hawthorn, myrtle pachystima, woods rose, and common princes pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Idaho and Western Montana. This soil is of small extent.
