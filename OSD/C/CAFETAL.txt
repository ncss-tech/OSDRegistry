CAFETAL SERIES


The Cafetal series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium from basalt and andesite. Cafetal soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 66 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic Durinodic Calciargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Cafetal extremely stony loam, rangeland and wildlife habitat. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). The soil surface is covered by approximately 40 percent pebbles, 20 percent cobbles and 20 percent stones.

(1 to 5 inches thick) 

	Bty--3 to 13 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very cobbly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; common fine soft masses of gypsum (2 percent); 20 percent pebbles, 30 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 15 inches thick) 

	Bqk1--13 to 22 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/4) extremely stony loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many fine calcium carbonate coats on rock fragments; 80 percent discontinuous weak silica and calcium carbonate cementation, brittle; 30 percent pebbles, 15 percent cobbles and 20 percent stones; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (8 to 12 inches thick) 

	Bqk2--22 to 38 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) stratified extremely cobbly loam to loamy sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; common thick calcium carbonate coats on tops and sides of rock fragments and many thick (1/4 to 1/2 inch) silica and calcium carbonate pendants on undersides; averages 20 percent pebbles, 30 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 18 inches thick) 

	2Bqk3--38 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely cobbly coarse sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; many thick (1/4 to 1/2 inch) silica and calcium carboante pendants on undersides of rock fragments; 30 percent pebbles, 30 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cafetal soils are on fan remnants. These soils formed in mixed alluvium from basalt and andesite. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent. Elevations are 1,800 to 3,600 feet. The climate is hot and arid with warm, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 5 inches, mean annual temperature is 64 to 69 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 240 to 300 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Arizo series. Arizo soils have sandy-skeletal particle-size control section and do not have an argillic horizon. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderately slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly creosotebush, white bursage and buckhorn cholla. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Nevada. MLRA 30. These soils are not extensive.
