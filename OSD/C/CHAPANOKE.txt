MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: City of Virginia Beach, Virginia; 1982.

REMARKS:  In the past Chapanoke soils have been included with Augusta and Barclay soils.  However, Chapanoke soils are in a fine-silty family.   The soil was proposed in Perquimans County, North Carolina, but established with the City of Virginia Beach, Virginia correlation.

Diagnostic horizons and soil properties recognized in the typical pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 6 inches (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon - the zone from 6 to 50 inches below the surface (Bt, Btg1, and Btg2 horizons)
