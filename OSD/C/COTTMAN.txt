Slope: Less than 0.2 percent
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 50 to 58 degrees F. (10 to 14 degrees C.)
Mean Annual Water Temperature: 52 to 58 degrees F. (11 to 14 degrees C.)
Water Regime: Tidal, 1.0 to 2.0 feet tidal range

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
Demas soils--are sandy soils formed in barrier island dune sediments on storm-surge washover fan flats and slopes
Indian River soils--are sandy soils formed in flood-tidal delta sediments
Marshneck soils--are found on flood-tidal delta slopes and not lagoon bottom barrier side landforms and are on steeper slopes
Tingles soils--are fine-silty soils formed in lagoonal sediments on lagoon bottoms 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage Class: Subaqueous (permanently submerged)
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: Moderately low to moderately high

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for recreation and benthic habitats as a source for food, shelter, and other essential life support.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Distribution: Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and possibly Virginia 
Extent: Small

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Ocean County, New Jersey, 2016. 

REMARKS: 
Soil is permanently submerged with salt or brackish water. The presence of sulfidic material within 20 inches (50 centimeters) of the soil surface puts these soils at risk for acid sulfate drainage if they are dredged and exposed to the air.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Peraquic feature - Positive soil water potential (permanently submerged) at the soil surface. (Under 73 inches (185 centimeters) of salt water)
Sulfidic materials - within 20 inches (50 centimeters) of the soil surface. (the Ase and Cgse horizons)
