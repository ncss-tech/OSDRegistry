CRAGNOT SERIES

The Cragnot series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum, colluvium, and alluvium derived from limestone.  Cragnot soils are on hills and valleys.  Slopes range from 6 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 to 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, frigid Aridic Calciustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cragnot very channery loam, on a north-facing, convex, 33 percent slope in pinyon pine and juniper at an elevation of 7,000 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on November 10, 1994 the soil was moist from 0 to 4 inches.

The surface is covered by 15 percent cobbles and 3 percent stones.

A--0 to 3 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) very channery loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; weak medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; very few fine vesicular and tubular pores; 10 percent gravel, 30 percent channers, 10 percent flagstones; calcium carbonate disseminated; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  ( 3 to 8 inches thick)

Bk1--3 to 12 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very channery silt loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common fine and few medium roots; common fine vesicular and tubular pores; 10 percent gravel, 35 percent channers, 10 percent flagstones; many distinct calcium carbonate coats; violently effervescent; 32 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bk horizon is 33 to 52 inches thick)

Bk2--12 to 30 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) extremely channery silt loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine and medium roots; common fine vesicular and tubular pores; 15 percent gravel, 40 percent channers, 15 percent flagstones; many distinct calcium carbonate coats; violently effervescent; 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary. 

Bk3--30 to 38 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely channery silt loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; common fine vesicular and tubular pores; 15 percent gravel, 40 percent channers, 15 percent flagstones; many distinct calcium carbonate coats; violently effervescent; 44 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary. 

BCk--38 to 60 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) very channery silt loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; very few fine roots; few fine vesicular and tubular pores; 10 percent gravel, 20 percent channers, 7 percent flagstones; few faint calcium carbonate coats; violently effervescent; 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8).  (0 to 24 inches thick)
