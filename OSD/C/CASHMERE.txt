CASHMERE SERIES

The Cashmere series consists of very deep or deep to cemented pan well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium over glaciofluvial material. They are on glacial outwash terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 65 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F,  and the mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haploxerolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Cashmere fine sandy loam, on a 13 percent southwest-facing slope at 1,800 feet elevation under grasses. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.) 

  A--0 to 10 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. (7 to 14 inches thick) 

  Bw1--10 to 22 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 14 inches thick) 

  Bw2--22 to 36 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 14 inches thick) 

  C1--36 to 46 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; 10 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (7 to 32 inches thick) 

  C2--46 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4). 

TYPE LOCATION: Colville Indian Reservation, Okanogan County, Washington; about 4  miles south of the town of Nespelem; 600 feet north and 1,700 feet east of the southwest corner of sec. 12, T. 30 N., R. 30 E., (Latitude 48 degrees, 06 minutes, 30.30 seconds North., Longitude 118 degrees, 59 minutes, 21.70 seconds West).

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil Moisture: dry throughout the soil moisture section for one-half to three-fourths of the time when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. (aridic soil moisture regime)
Soil Temperature:  mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 55 degrees F. 
Rock fragments: average 5 to 15 percent gravel and cobbles in the particle-size control section.
Solum thickness: 15 to 38 inches.
Some pedons have a weakly cemented duripan at 40 to 60 inches. 
Mollic epipedon: 7 to 14 inches thick.

Structure: weak prismatic or subangular blocky 
Reaction: neutral or slightly alkaline 

C horizon
Hue of 10YR or 2.5Y 
Value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist
Chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist
Texture: fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam.    Texture below a depth of 40 inches in some pedons: loamy fine sand, loamy sand or loamy coarse sand, and may contain strata 1/2 to 1/4 inch thick of silt or sand 
Gravel: 0 to 10 percent gravel
Cobbles: 0 to 2 percent cobbles 
Structure: massive or single-grain. 
Reaction: neutral to moderately alkaline 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Burch, Calpine,, Cashmont, Rio King, Roloff, Roosevelt, and Snake Hollow series. Burch soils are loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam throughout the particle-size control section. Calpine soils are moderately acid or slightly acid throughout the particle-size control section and have faint clay films line pores and bridge between grains. Cashmont soils are 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section. Roloff and Roosevelt soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Snake Hollow soils are calcareous and moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline in the lower part of the control section. Rio King soils are moderately well drained. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cashmere soils are on terraces and terrace escarpments.  Slope ranges from 0 to 65 percent.  The soils formed in glaciofluvial material and alluvium mixed with loess in the surface.  Elevations are 700 to 3,000 feet. They occur in a cool, dry semiarid climate; mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches, mean January temperature is 22 degrees F., mean July temperature is 73 degrees F., mean annual temperature is 49 degrees F., and frost-free period is 140 to 195 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Cashmont soils and the Aeneas, Farrell, Malott, Okanogan, Peshastin, Pogue, Quincy, Skaha, Strat, and Tonasket soils. Aeneas and Pogue soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal. Farrell, Malott, Peshastin, and Tonasket soils are calcidic. In addition, Peshastin soils are loamy-skeletal. Okanogan soils have an irregular decrease in organic matter. Strat soils are loamy-skeletal. Quincy soils are sandy throughout. Skaha soils are sandy-skeletal. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, slow to rapid runoff; moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Principal uses are cultivated cropland, orchards, hay and pasture, rangeland, and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is bluebunch wheatgrass, needleandthread, Sandberg bluegrass, arrowleaf balsamroot, Wyoming big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, and silky lupine. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North-central Washington and east-central  Idaho; MLRA 7, 8 and 11. The soils are of moderate extent.
