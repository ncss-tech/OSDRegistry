COLOLAG SERIES

The Cololag series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rock. Cololag soils are on fan fan remnant summits. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 74 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, hyperthermic Typic Calciargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Cololag extremely gravelly sandy loam, rangeland and wildlife habitat. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered by approximately  60 percent pebbles and 5 percent cobbles. 

	A--0 to 3 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) extremely gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; strong medium and coarse platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common fine interstitial and few fine tubular pores; 60 percent pebbles and 5 percent cobbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick) 

	Bk1--3 to 14 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) extremely gravelly loamy sand, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and few fine medium roots; many very fine and fine interstitial and few fine tubular pores; many (30 percent) medium calcium carbonate coats on bottom of rock fragments; 65 percent pebbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 12 inches thick) 

	Btk--14 to 24 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) very gravelly sandy loam, yellowish red (5YR 5/6) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; few fine interstitial and few fine and medium tubular pores; discontinuous extremely weakly cemented calcium carbonate masses; few faint clay films bridging sand grains; common (15 percent) fine calcium carbonate coats on coarse sand grains; medium coats on bottom of rock fragments; 35 percent pebbles and 5 percent cobbles; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 12 inches thick) 

	B'k2--24 to 31 inches; pink (5YR 7/3) gravelly sandy loam, yellowish red (5YR 5/6) moist; massive; very hard, extremely firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine tubular and few fine interstitial pores; discontinuous moderate cementation; many (45 percent) fine and medium calcium carbonate masses and many (70 percent) medium calcium carbonate coats on bottom of rock fragments; 25 percent pebbles; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 8 inches thick) 

	B'k3--31 to 65 inches; pink (5YR 7/4) extremely gravelly sandy loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine tubular and few fine interstitial pores; discontinuous weak calcium carbonate cementation; many (30 percent) fine and medium calcium carbonate coats on bottom of rock fragments; 70 percent pebbles; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cololag soils are on fan remnant summits. These soils formed in alluvium derived from igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rock.. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Elevations are 800 to 1,700 feet. The climate is arid with warm, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 5 inches, the mean annual temperature is 70 to 76 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 300 to 365 days.
