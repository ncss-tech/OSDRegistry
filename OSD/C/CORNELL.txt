CORNELL SERIES

The Cornell series consist of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in 25 to 125 centimeters of loamy and silty sediments and in the underlying till. These soils occur on shoulder slopes and side slopes on dissected till plains.  Slope ranges from 9 to 40 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 725 millimeters.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Clay County, Iowa 2002 

REMARKS: 
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 41 to 91 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 200 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 41 centimeters (A1, A2, and AB horizons)
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 41 to 200 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, 2Bt4, 2Bt5, 2Bt6, and 2Bt7 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Differentia between Cornell series and Pawnee series needs further study. 

Cornell soils were included with Clarion heavy subsoil variant or Storden loam on previous surveys.
