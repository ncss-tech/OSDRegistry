CARTEN SERIES

The Carten series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium 12 to 20 inches deep over loose sand and gravel.  These soils are on glacial outwash plains, flood plains, alluvial fans, and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Oxyaquic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Carten loam, cropland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 7 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many very fine discontinuous irregular pores; 5 percent pebbles; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 9 inches thick)

    Bw--7 to 9 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine discontinuous irregular pores; 5 percent pebbles; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 7 inches thick)

    Bk--9 to 13 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 25 percent pebbles; disseminated lime, common distinct lime casts on undersides of pebbles; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8) gradual wavy boundary. (3 to 8 inches thick)

    BC--13 to 16 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 5 percent cobbles, 35 percent pebbles; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 4 inches thick)

    2C--16 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly loamy sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 15 percent cobbles, 35 percent pebbles; few fine distinct brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) redox concentrations; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Powell County, Montana, 1995. Series proposed in Deer Lodge County, Montana, 1984.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1107.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the surface to 9 inches (Ap, Bw horizons);  a horizon of calcium carbonate accumulation from 9 to 13 inches (Bk horizon); a lithologic discontinuity at 16 inches (2C horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bk, BC, 2C horizons).  Carten soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
