Saturated hydraulic conductivity--moderately high to high
Surface runoff potential--is very low to medium depending on slope 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. The principal crops are corn, soybeans, small grains, and legume hay. The native vegetation is big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, and other grasses of the tall grass prairie.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Hamilton County, Iowa, 1917. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section--the zone from 25 to 100 centimeters (10 to 40 inches)
Series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (59 inches)
Mollic epipedon--zone from the surface to a depth of 18 inches (Ap, A1, and A2 horizon)
Cambic horizon--the zone from 46 to 91 centimeters (18 to 36 inches) (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)
Udic moisture regime. 

The concepts of moderately coarse and moderately fine substratum phases were established by the mlra-103 steering committee based on an analysis of particle size data from Iowa and Minnesota. The Des Moines Lobe till generally gets sandier and has less clay as one progresses south along the path of the Des Moines advance. 

Based on piezometer data from Iowa and Minnesota the Clarion series concept was changed to a soil that has soil saturation between 4 and 6 feet. Previously, Clarion soils did not have saturation above 6 feet. 

In parts of MLRA-103 this drainage class is called well drained based on the Soil Survey Manual. Drainage class is a state interpretation.
