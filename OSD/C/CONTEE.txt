CONTEE SERIES

The Contee series consists of very deep, well drained, very slowly permeables soils that formed in clayey fluviomarine deposits derived from the Beaumont Formation of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on flats on flat coastal plains. Slope is mainly less than 1 percent but range up to 3.  Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (70 degrees F).

REMARKS: Classification changed from Vertic Haplaquepts to Chromic Hapluderts 11/2000 based on typifying pedon description.  Further study and characterization data of the series is needed to verify hydrology and classification.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in) (A horizon).
Vertic feature: 20 to 124 cm (8 to 49 in) (Bss and Bkss horizon) includes pressure surfaces and cracks with slickensides in some pedons.
Calcic horizon: 69 to 203 cm (27 to 80 in) (Bkss, Bk, and BCk horizons).

ADDITIONAL DATA: none.
