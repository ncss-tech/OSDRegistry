CASSIA SERIES

The Cassia series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in sandy marine deposits. Cassia soils are on low ridges and knolls on scrubby flatwoods.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1397 millimeters (55 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 21 degrees C (72 degrees F.)

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Sandy, siliceous, hyperthermic Oxyaquic Alorthods

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cassia sand is in a slightly convex rangeland on a slight rise at elevation of about 24 meters (80 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil).

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Under natural conditions Cassia soils are used for water quality and wildlife habitat, some areas are used for range.  
Potential native vegetation consists of scattered slash pine, longleaf pine, and saw palmetto. The understory vegetation consists of splitbeard bluestem, broomsedge bluestem, creeping bluestem, low panicum, lopsided indiangrass, pineland threeawn, paspalum, switchgrass, runner oak, and saw palmetto.

REMARKS:  
Particle-size control section: 25 to 100 centimeters (10 to 40 inches)

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:

Ochric epipedon - 0 to 64 centimeters (0 to 25 inches) (A, E horizons)

Albic horizon - 10 to 64 centimeters (4 to 25 inches) (E horizon)

Spodic horizon - 64 to 94 centimeters (25 to 37 inches) (Bh1, Bh2 horizons)

Aquic conditions - Endosaturation 46 to 107 centimeters (18 to 42 inches)

Redoximorphic concentrations and depletions: 94 to 203 centimeters (37 to 80 inches) (C horizons)  

The moderately well drained phase has been dropped from the series concept because it does not classify as an Oxyaquic Alorthods.  It will be considered a variant of the Cassia series until a decision is made on how to handle it.

Soil classified according to the 12th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.
