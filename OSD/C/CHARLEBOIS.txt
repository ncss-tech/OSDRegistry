CHARLEBOIS SERIES

The Charlebois series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium primarily from andesite with components of pyroclastics and volcanic ash.  These soils are on alluvial fans and basin fill plains.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Argiduridic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Charlebois loam, alfalfa hayland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 5 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many fine and very fine interstitial pores; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 cm thick)

    Bt1--5 to 20 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and common very fine roots; few fine and many very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on surfaces along pores; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 18 cm thick)

    Bt2--20 to 36 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium and fine angular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and many very fine roots; common fine and many very fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on surfaces along pores and on faces of peds; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 20 cm thick) 

    Bt3--36 to 48 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and common very fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on surfaces along pores and on faces of peds; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 20 cm thick)

    Bqk--48 to 91 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and many very fine roots; few fine and many very fine tubular pores; about 30 percent firm and brittle durinodes; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (25 to 50 cm thick)

    Bk--91 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and many very fine roots; few fine and many very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Lyon County, Nevada.  About 4,700 feet east of the northwest corner of section l8, T. l0 N., R. 24 E.; USGS Desert Creek Ranch 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; 38 degrees 4 minutes 10 seconds north latitude and 119 degrees 10 minutes 1 seconds west longitude; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.7361111 latitude, -119.3336111 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist in winter and spring; dry in summer and fall, aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric.  
Soil temperature: 11 to 12 degrees C.
Depth to carbonates: 36 to 60 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  27 to 35 percent.

A horizon
Value:  3 or 4 moist.
Reaction:  Neutral or slightly alkaline.

Bt1 horizon
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.

Bt2 horizon and Bt3 horizon (if present)
Value:  4, 5, or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Texture:  Clay loam, with transition horizons of loam, fine sandy loam or silt loam in some pedons.
Structure:  Subangular blocky or prismatic.
Reaction:  Neutral or mildly alkaline.

Cqk horizon
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Texture:  Loam or sandy loam.
Durinodes:  20 to 40 percent by volume.
Reaction:  Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Galeppi and Wredah series.  Galeppi and Wredah are continuously weakly cemented.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Charlebois soils are on alluvial fans lake-plain terraces and basin floors.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The soils formed in mixed alluvium primarily from andesite with components of pyroclastics and volcanic ash.  Elevations are 1,490 to 1,680 meters.  The mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C and mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm.  Frost-free season is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the East Fork series.  East Fork soils are somewhat poorly drained and lack an argillic horizon and durinodes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow or medium runoff; moderately slow permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Charlebois soils are used for irrigated hay and grain.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  The series is not extensive. MLRA 26.
