Votaw soils: are sandy throughout; on a relict meander belt point bar.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Caneyhead soils are very poorly drained.  Runoff is negligible.  Permeability is slow.  These soils are ponded from December to May and have aquic conditions during this time in most years.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used primarily for wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is black gum, water oak, red maple, sedges, rushes, panicums and paspalums.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The Western Gulf Coast Flatwoods (MLRA 152B) of southeast Texas and possibly Louisiana.  The series is of moderate extent.
