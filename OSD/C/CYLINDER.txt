CYLINDER SERIES

The Cylinder series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on stream terraces and outwash plains.  These soils formed in 24 to 40 inches of loamy alluvium overlying sand and gravel outwash.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C (47 degrees F).  Mean annual precipitation is about 710 millimeters (28 inches).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquic Hapludolls
