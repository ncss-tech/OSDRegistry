CONLEN SERIES

The Conlen series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy, calcareous eolian sediments of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils occur on plains, interfluves of the plains, valley sides of plains, and playa rims in the Southern High Plains, Northern Part (MLRA 77A).  Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent.  The annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm (18 in).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Sherman County, Texas; 1970.

REMARKS:  
These soils were formerly included in the Mansker series.  The Conlen series was revised during the MLRA-77 Update Soil Survey; Hansford County, Texas; 2006.  Based on lab data the particle-size class changed from fine-loamy to coarse-loamy 3/2007.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in) (A horizon)
Calcic horizon: 25 to 203 cm (10 to 80 in) (Bkk and Bk horizons)
Carbonatic mineralogy and carbonate plugged horizon: 25 to 145 cm. (10 to 57 in) (Bkk horizons)
