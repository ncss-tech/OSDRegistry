COMPETING SERIES: 
Brooklyn soils are typically stratified in the lower part of the series control section. 
Cowden and Denny soils average less than 10 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. 
Smileyville soils average more than 42 percent clay in the particle-size control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Cisne soils are on broad ground moraines on till plains of Illinoian age. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in 76 to 140 centimeters (30 to 55 inches) of loess and the underlying pedisediment. The loess is late Wisconsin age Peoria Loess and the underlying material is early Wisconsin age pedisediment or Roxana Silt which overlie a Sangamon age paleosol in Illinoian till. In some pedons the pedisediment includes pebbles of the Illinoian till concentrated by erosion or reworked material derived from the upper horizons of the Sangamon paleosol.

Elevation--122 to 213 meters (400 to 700 feet) above mean sea level

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
Hoyleton soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on higher positions nearby. 
Huey soils have a natric horizon and are on similar or slightly lower positions nearby or are mixed in an intricate pattern with Cisne soils on similar positions. 
Wynoose soils have a moist color value of 4 or more in the surface layer and are on similar positions nearby or on narrower interfluves that are closer to dissected parts of the till plain.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class--poorly drained
Water table--depth to the top of an apparent water table is within 30 centimeters (1 foot) of the surface at some time between January and May in normal years. 
Saturated hydraulic conductivity class--moderately high to low
Permeability class--slow or very slow

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Most areas of Cisne soils are used to grow corn, soybeans, and wheat. Native vegetation is prairie grasses with some widely spaced trees in places. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
MLRAs 113 and 114 in southern Illinois. The series is extensive.

REMARKS: 
Typical Pedon Taxonomic Features--
Ochric epipedon--from the surface to a depth of 43 centimeters (Ap, Eg1, and Eg2 horizons). The upper portion meets the requirements of a mollic epipedon except for thickness; the lower portion commonly has less than 50 percent base saturation
Albic horizon--from a depth of 20 to 43 centimeters (Eg1 and Eg2 horizons) 
Argillic horizon--from a depth of 43 to 109 centimeters (B/E, Btg1, Btg2, and 2Btg3 horizons) 
Abrupt textural change from the Eg2 horizon to the Btg1 horizon
Aquic conditions--redoximorphic features present in all horizons below the Ap horizon

A bench phase is recognized for soils on structural benches that occur along some major tributaries of the Mississippi River. 

A mine-sinks phase is recognized for soils in areas of Perry County that have subsided due to subsurface mine wall collapse. In these areas, the mine-sink phase of Cisne soils has a perched water table as much as 183 centimeters (6 feet) above the surface to 30 centimeters (1 foot) below the surface at some time between February and July in normal years.
