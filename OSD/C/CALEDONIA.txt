CALEDONIA SERIES

The Caledonia series consists of very deep, well drained, soils that formed in thick loamy sediments.  Caledonia soils are on terraces in the Southern Coastal Plain. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 1300 to 1450 millimeters (51 to 57 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10 to 22 degrees C (51 to 73 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Typic Paleudalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON: Caledonia silt loam on a nearly level convex 0.5 percent slope, in a cultivated field.
(Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

  Ap-- 0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) silt loam; weak fine granular structure; friable; common fine roots; many fine pores; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary [13 to 25 centimeters (5 to 10 inches) thick].

  Bt1-- 18 to 33 centimeters (7 to 13 inches); dark red (2.5YR 3/6) silt loam; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; many fine pores; thin patchy clay films on faces of peds; neutral; gradual smooth boundary. 

  Bt2-- 33 to 66 centimeters (13 to 26 inches); dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) clay loam; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; firm, slightly plastic; few fine roots; common fine pores; thin continuous clay films on faces of peds; medium acid; gradual smooth boundary. [Upper part of the Bt horizon is 36 to 64 centimeters (14 to 25 inches) thick].

  Bt3-- 66 to 127 centimeters (26 to 50 inches); dark red (2.5YR 3/6) clay loam; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; firm, slightly plastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; thin continuous clay films on faces of peds; strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.

  Bt4-- 127 to 183 centimeters (50 to 72 inches); dark red (2.5YR 3/6) clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm, slightly plastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; thin patchy clay films on faces of peds; strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.

  Bt5-- 183 to 218 centimeters (72 to 86 inches); dark red (2.5YR 3/6) sandy clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm, slightly plastic; few fine pores; thin patchy clay films on faces of some peds; few coats and pockets of fine sand on faces of some peds; strongly acid. [Lower part of the Bt horizon is greater than 117 centimeters (46 inches)].
