MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Washington County, North Carolina; 1975.

REMARKS: Conaby soils were classified in the Half-Bog Great Soil Group and mapped as mucky phases of the Pocomoke and Torhunta series.

Diagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon are:

Histic epipedon -the zone from the surface to a depth of 13 inches (the Oa horizons.)

Cambic horizon -in the zone between depths of 17 to 33 inches (the Bg horizon.)

Aquic conditions -observed periodic endosaturation and iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less in mineral horizons that are not coated with organic matter (Bg and Cg horizons)

Used in MLRA: 153A, 153B
