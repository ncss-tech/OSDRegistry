CENIZA SERIES

The Ceniza series is a deep, somewhat excessively drained soil that formed in volcanic cinders on plateaus.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Cindery, mixed, mesic Pachic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ceniza extremely gravelly loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 6 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; loose, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; 75 percent gravel-size cinders; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary.

    C1--6 to 18 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive; loose, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; 55 percent gravel-size cinders; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)

    C2--18 to 30 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely gravelly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive; loose, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; 65 percent gravel-size cinders; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 14 inches thick)

    C3--30 to 42 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) cinders, black (10YR 2/1) moist; structureless; 90 percent gravel-size cinders; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4) abrupt smooth boundary.  (10 to 20 inches thick)

    2C4--42 to 60 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) loamy fine sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Catron County, New Mexico; about 4 miles east of the Zuni Salt Lake in SE1/4, sec. 22, T. 3. N., R. 18 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture: Aridic ustic moisture regime.

Gravel-size cinders:  35 to 90 percent throughout

A horizon: Dry color:  10YR 5/3, 5/2 Moist color:  10YR 3/3, 3/2 Hue: 10YR
Value: 5 dry, 3 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3 dry or moist
Texture: sandy loam, loam with more than 60 percent gravel-size cinders.

C horizon
Value:  2 through 6 dry, 2 through 5 moist
Chroma:  1 through 6 
Texture:  sandy loam, loam, loamy very fine sand with more than 35 percent gravel-size cinders.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Ceniza soils are on plateaus where slopes are 1 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 6,400 to 7,300 feet.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 to 15 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 47 to 54 degrees F.  The average frost-free season is about 115 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Goesling, Hubbell, Jacee, and Tejana soils.  Goesling, Jacee and Tejana soils have an argillic horizon.  Hubbell soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderately rapid to rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Ceniza soils are used for livestock grazing. Present vegetation is blue grama, wolfberry and rabbitbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central New Mexico.  The series is of small extent. MLRA 35.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 30 inches.  (A, C1, and C2 horizons)

Mixed mineralogy was added to the taxonomic class in 2006.

Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Tenth Edition, 2006.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  A pedon numbered S79NM003-5-(1 to 5) was sampled for characterization and sent to the New Mexico State University.  A pedon numbered S80NM003-22-(1 to 5) was sampled by the SCS, Lincoln Laboratory for characterization.
