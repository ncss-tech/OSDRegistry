The superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.

03/2025--This official series description was updated according to SSRO1 Technical Note-Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 11/6/2017); most of the changes were in formatting with a few technical updates in expanded range of characteristics, landforms, and parent material description.
