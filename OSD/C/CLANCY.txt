CLANCY SERIES 

The Clancy series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or residuum derived from granite bedrock.  These soils are on hills, ridges and escarpments. Slopes are 2 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, moderate permeability in argillic horizon and rapid in the BC horizon. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Clancy soils are primarily used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The potential native vegetation is mainly rough fescue, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, prairie junegrass, lupine, fringed sagewort, milkvetch, and threetip sagebrush.  Areas with a forest canopy have an overstory of ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, limber pine and an understory of Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Rocky mountain juniper. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Clancy soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Jefferson County, Montana, 1998. 

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record: MT1558, MT1559, MT3046. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 8 inches (A horizon); an argillic horizon from 8 to 22 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizons); a particle-size control section from 8 to 22 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizons); a layer of decomposed granite bedrock (grus) between 30 and 55 inches (Cr horizon); hard granite bedrock at 55 inches (R horizon).  Clancy soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
