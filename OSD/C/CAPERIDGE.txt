CAPERIDGE SERIES

The Caperidge series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone, mudstone, and metasedimentary rocks. Caperidge soils are on mountains and have slopes of 5 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1520 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, isomesic Typic Humustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Caperidge gravelly loam; on an east facing convex slope of 37 percent under Douglas-fir, grand fir, California laurel, tanoak, and western swordfern. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.) When described on June 7, 2007, the soil was dry throughout.

 Bt2--80 to 110 centimeters; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots throughout; many very fine irregular and common very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on top surfaces of rock fragments and few faint clay films on all faces of peds; 37 percent strongly cemented sandstone gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual wavy boundary.

 Bt3--110 to 140 centimeters; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, firm, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots throughout; common very fine irregular pores; few faint clay films on all faces of peds; 45 percent strongly cemented sandstone gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual wavy boundary.

 Bt4--140 to 180 centimeters; pale brown (10YR 6/3), brown (10YR 4/3) extremely gravelly loam moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, and few fine roots throughout; common very fine irregular pores; few faint clay films on all faces of peds; 60 percent strongly cemented sandstone gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2). (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 100 to 175 centimeters)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Surface Fragments: 0 to 14 percent gravel, 0 to 1 percent stones

Umbric Epipedon: is 25 to 75 centimeters thick

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series at this time. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Caperidge soils are on slightly concave to slightly convex shoulder and backslope positions on ridges and mountain slopes. Slopes are 5 to 75 percent. Elevations are 5 to 855 meters. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from strongly to very strongly cemented sandstone, mudstone, and metasedimentary rocks. Mean annual precipitation is 1140 to 2280 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C. Frost free season is about 240 to 330 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Northbear and Taylorpeak soils. Northbear soils have less than 35 percent gravel in the particle size control section and are on linear to slightly concave or convex summit, shoulder, and backslope positions. Taylorpeak soils have bedrock with cracks closer than 10 centimeters at 70 to 100 centimeters and are on convex summit and shoulder positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; moderate to high runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for timber production, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Natural vegetation includes Douglas-fir, grand fir, California laurel, tanoak, oceanspray, western swordfern, evergreen huckleberry, thimbleberry, gooseberry, and Douglas iris. Where this series occurs at higher elevations and in its interior and southernmost extent, grand fir is absent. In its interior location, the natural vegetation can include black oak and canyon live oak.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coastal Redwood Belt 4B. The series is not extensive.
