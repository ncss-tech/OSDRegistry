MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Chautauqua County, New York, 1988.

REMARKS:  This soil was originally classified as an Alfisol.  It now classifies in the subgroup of Typic Hapludults.  

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
a. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 10 inches (Ap and BE horizons).
b. Argillic horizon - the zone from 25 to 68 cm (10 to 27 inches) (Bt1 and 
Bt2 horizons).
c. Lithic contact - bedrock at 68 cm (27 inches).
