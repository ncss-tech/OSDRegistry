CRASH SERIES

The Crash series consists of very deep, well drained soils on terrace escarpments.  They formed in silty calcareous glaciolacustrine sediments.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slope ranges from 35 to 75 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 30 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Lamellic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Crash silt loam, woodland; on a north-facing slope of 65 percent at 2,100 feet elevation.  When described on August 23, 1972, the soil was dry throughout.  The pedon was redescribed on September 26, 1994.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

(6 to 12 inches thick)

    Bt3--20 to 29 inches; light olive gray (5Y 6/2) silt loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; moderate coarse platy structure; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 5 to 20 percent of this horizon has dark yellowish brown lamellae 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick that have about 10 percent more clay than the matrix; few very fine black concretions; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 12 inches thick)

    Bk--29 to 60 inches; light olive gray (5Y 6/2) silt loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; moderate coarse platy structure; very hard, very firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; violently effervescent (calcium carbonate); distinct lime veins and masses between plates; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Artnoc series. Artnoc soils do not have a Bk horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Crash soils are on north-facing terrace escarpments.  Slopes range from 35 to 75 percent.  They formed in silty calcareous glaciolacustrine sediments.  Elevations range from 1,800 to 2,700 feet.  The climate is humid with cold, wet winters and warm, relatively dry summers. The average annual air temperature ranges from 42 to 44 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is 25 to 30 inches.  The average frost-free period is 80 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Artnoc, Caboose and Wishbone soils.  Artnoc soils are on west and east-facing terrace escarpments and do not have a Bk horizon.  Caboose soils are on southeast and southwest facing terrace escarpments and have a xeric moisture regime.  Wishbone soils are on south facing terrace escarpments and have a mesic temperature regime.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; rapid to very rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Woodland, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  Natural vegetation is mainly western hemlock, western redcedar, western white pine, western larch, Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, and lodgepole pine, with and understory of myrtle pachystima, baldhip rose, longtube twinflower, queencup beadlily, darkwoods violet, and western rattlesnake plantain.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Idaho, northwestern Montana, and possibly northeastern Washington.  Series is moderately extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Boundary County, Idaho, 1974.

REMARKS:  Classifiaction change from Psammentic Haploxeralfs coarse-silty, mixed, frigid to Psammentic Glossoboralfs coarse-silty, mixed in 1994.  Natural vegetation indicates udic moisture regime.  Classification changed to Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Lamellic Hapludalfs in 1998 due to eighth edition of Soil Taxonomy.
