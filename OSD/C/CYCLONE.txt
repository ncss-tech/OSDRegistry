CYCLONE SERIES

The Cyclone series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in loess or silty material and in the underlying drift. Cyclone soils are on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.6 degrees C (51 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Argiaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Cyclone silty clay loam, on a less than 1 percent linear slope in a cultivated field at an elevation of about 280 meters (920 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 2C--152 to 178 cm (60 to 70 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam; massive; firm; many coarse distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions in the matrix; 5 percent rock fragments; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cald, Gabriel, Luray, Mahalaland, Mahalasville, Ragsdale, and Treaty series. Cald and Gabriel soils have a mollic epipedon that is thicker than 51 cm (20 inches). Luray soils do not have rock fragments in the lower part of the argillic horizon. Mahalaland, Mahalasville, and Treaty soils are less than 102 cm (40 inches) to horizons containing rock fragments. Ragsdale soils average less than 15 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cyclone soils are in depressions and on broad flats on till plains of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) of loess or silty material and in the underlying drift. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1016 mm (35 to 40 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.0 to 12.8 degrees C (50 and 55 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Fincastle, Ragsdale, and Starks soils. The somewhat poorly drained Fincastle and Starks soils do not have a mollic epipedon and are on higher landform positions. The competing Ragsdale soils are on slightly lower landform positions in swales.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained. Depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 15 cm (0.5 foot) below the surface between December and March in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate in the loess or silty material and moderately slow in the underlying drift. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Cyclone soils are cultivated. Corn and soybeans are the main crops grown.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 111A and 111D in central Indiana and western Ohio. The type location is in MLRA 111A. The series is of moderate extent.
