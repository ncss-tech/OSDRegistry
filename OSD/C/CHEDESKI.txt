CHEDESKI SERIES

The Chedeski series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in alluvium from sedimentary rocks.  Chedeski soils are on undulating plateaus.  Slopes are l to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Ustic Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON: Chedeski sandy loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 1 inch; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) sandy loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; weak thin platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine tubular pores; many very fine roots; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (1 to 2 inches thick)

    Bw1--1 to 3 inches; red (2.5YR 5/6) sandy loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common fine tubular pores; many fine roots; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (1 to 2 inches thick)

    Bw2--3 to 13 inches; red (2.5YR 5/6) sandy clay loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine tubular pores; common fine roots; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 11 inches thick)

    Bk--13 to 16 inches; reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) sandy clay loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine tubular pores; common fine and medium roots; 10 percent channers; violently effervescent, 18 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; calcium carbonate segregated as coatings on rock fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (3 to 5 inches thick)

    2Cr--16 to 26 inches; weathered sandstone with calcium carbonate coatings; abrupt wavy boundary.  (10 to 15 inches thick)

    2R--26 inches; sandstone.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chedeski soils are on broad undulating plateaus at elevations of 5,500 to 6,500 feet.  They formed in mixed alluvium derived dominantly from sandstone, mudstone, and limestone.  Slopes range from l to 5 percent.  The climate is cool, semi-arid, continental with l0 to l4 inches precipitation occurring as thunderstorms in summer and rain and snow in winter.  The mean annual air temperature is 5l to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is l30 to l60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bisoodi and Leanto soils.  Bisoodi and Leanto soils have a lithic contact within 20 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, recreation, and fuelwood production.  Vegetation is oneseed juniper, pinyon pine, black grama, blue grama, Indian ricegrass, ring muhly, galleta, sand dropseed, broom snakeweed, and sandhill muhly.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Arizona.  The series is of limited extent. MLRA is 35.
