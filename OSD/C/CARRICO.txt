CARRICO SERIES

The Carrico series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on mountain slopes. They formed in mixed volcanic ash, loess and residuum from granite. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Slope ranges from 5 to 80 percent. The average annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C. The average annual precipitation is about 711 mm.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, isotic, frigid Vitrandic Haploxeralfs

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Carrico soils are on mountain slopes. They are at elevations of 826 to 1242 meters. They have slopes ranging from 5 to 75 percent. These soils formed in mixed volcanic ash, loess and material weathered from granite.  The average annual temperature is 4.4 to 7.2 degrees C. The average annual precipitation is 686 to 1041 mm and the frost-free season is 95 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Carlinton, Keeler and Kruse series. Carlinton soils are on hills and broad ridges, are fine-silty and moderately deep to a fragipan. Keeler soils are on mountain slope and ridges, are very deep and have a udic moisture regime. Kruse soils are on mountain slopes, ridges and hills and are very deep.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used primarily for timber production,
livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed. The
natural vegetation is mainly Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, common snowberry, creambush oceanspray, bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, white spirea and baldhip rose.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North-Central Idaho. Carrico soils are not extensive.  MLRA 43A.
