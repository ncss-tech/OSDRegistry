COLAND SERIES

The Coland series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in alluvium. These soils are on floodplains and alluvial fans in river valleys and upland drainageways in dissected till plains.

The native vegetation is big bluestem, western wheatgrass, sedges, blue grama and other species of the tall grass prairie that are tolerant of excessive wetness. See Additional Data section for native vegetative cover in Iowa and Minnesota.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Mitchell County, Iowa, 1971.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 102 centimeters (Ap, A1, A2, and AB horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 102 to 132 centimeters (Bg1 and Bg2 horizons);
aquic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange class is inferred from lab data for similar soils in the surrounding area.

The differentia between Coland and Excello series needs further study.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  In Iowa and Minnesota, the native vegetative cover is a herbaceous wetland community commonly inhabited with Prairie Cordgrasses, Bluejoint Grasses, Fox Sedges, Oval Sedges, Inland Rushes, New England Asters, Foxglove Penstemons, Cool Mountain Mints, Prairie Sundrops, Winged Loosestrifes, and Saw-Tooth Sunflowers.
