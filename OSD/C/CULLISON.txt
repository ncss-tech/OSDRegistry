CULLISON SERIES

The Cullison series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils formed in loamy eolian deposits on swales on interdunes on sandhills of the Nebraska Sandhills (MLRA 65). Permeability is moderate. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 46 centimeters (18 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. (47 degrees F.) at the type location.

Hoffland soils are on similar swales on interdunes and are sandy in the control section. 
Nenzel soils are higher on swales and hummocks on interdunes and are moderately well drained having a seasonal zone of saturation or aquic conditions beginning at 91 centimeters (36 inches).
Marlake soils are in depressions on interdunes and are very poorly drained having a seasonal zone of saturation or aquic conditions beginning at the surface and having ponding up to 61 centimeters (24 inches). 
Valentine soils are on higher hummocks and dunes and are excessively drained having no seasonal zone of saturation or aquic conditions.

USE AND VEGETATION: The major use is livestock grazing and haying. The rangeland native plant community for the wet subirrigated ecological site (RO65XY023NE) is mostly big bluestem, prairie cordgrass, switchgrass, yellow indiangrass, and tall dropseed; for the wetland ecological site (R065XY022NE) it is mostly prairie cordgrass, northern reedgrass, bluejoint reedgrass, slender wheatgrass, sedges, and rushes.

Aquic soil conditions: 46 to 200 centimeters (18 to 79 inches) (the Bkg1, Bkg2, Bkg3, and Bkg4 horizons) 
RRZ in 6/2002: FSL and SICL textures were added to the Ak horizon. SICL texture added to the Bkg horizon 
RRH in 3/2007: All changed to metric. Introductory paragraph: revised. Typical pedon: revised, extended Ak horizon to include all of mollic epipedon. RIC's: revised including the O horizon: described ranges as in other horizons, Ak horizon: Textures: added mucky loam and mucky fine sandy loam. Geographic Setting through Distribution and Extent: revised. Geographically Associated Soils: Deleted Crowther, Els, Gannett, and Gus, added Elsmere and Nenzel. Additional Data: revised.
RRH in 3/2009: Introductory paragraph and Geographic Setting: Changed slope range to 0 to 1 percent. Typical pedon: changed loam to mucky peat to agree with Oe horizon. 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Data is available from the National Soil Survey Center, Soil Survey Laboratory for Pedon IDs 89NE031036, 89NE031039, 89NE031040, and 91NE075001. Pedon ID 89NE031036 represents the Typical Pedon and it also has data from the Nebraska Department of Roads.
