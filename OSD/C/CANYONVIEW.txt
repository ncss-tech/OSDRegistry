CANYONVIEW SERIES

The Canyonview series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in colluvium and till derived from granitic rocks. The Canyonview soils are on mountain slopes, glacial valley walls, colluvial aprons, talus slopes, and moraines of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 2 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 780 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Grandmound (MLRA 2) soils. The Grandmound soils formed in glacial outwash, do not contain fragments larger than cobbles, and are dry for less than 90 consecutive days in the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Canyonview soils are on convex backslopes of mountain slopes, glacial valley walls, colluvial aprons, talus slopes, and moraines. Slopes range from 2 to 90 percent. These soils formed in colluvium derived from granite. Elevation is 1210 to 2600 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 1170 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 6 to 12 degrees C. The frost free season is 95 to 195 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Gratwell, Roadsend, and Tharpslog soils. Gratwell soils are formed in slope alluvium and colluvium on linear and concave backslopes of mountain slopes, and have sandy loam textures and less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Roadsend soils are formed in glacial outwash on linear outwash terraces, and have less than 35 percent rock fragments throughout. Tharpslog soils are formed in residuum on linear and concave positions of backslopes and footslopes of mountain slopes, and have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Vegetation is ponderosa pine, canyon live oak, black oak, incense cedar, white fir, and mountain misery.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. These soils are extensive.
