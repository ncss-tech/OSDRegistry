CORWITH SERIES

The Corwith series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in medium-textured sediments.  These soils are on uplands, glacial lake plains, and outwash areas.  Slopes are convex and range from 1 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 740 millimeters.

COMPETING SERIES:
There are no other series in the same family

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Near the type location, these are the Canisteo, Fieldon, Kossuth, and Talcot soils.
All of these soils occur on lower landscape positions and are saturated at the surface to within 0.3 meters (11.8 inches) of the surface in an undrained condition

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--somewhat poorly drained--in a natural condition, saturation typically occurs at a depth between 0.3 and 1.0 meters (11.8 to 39.4 inches)
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--moderately high (1.0 to 10.0 micrometers per second)

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas of Corwith soils are cultivated.  Corn and soybeans are the principal crops.  The native vegetation is big bluestem, indiangrass, switchgrass, and other grasses of the tall grass prairie.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Physiographic Division--Interior Plains
Physiographic Province--Central Lowland
Physiographic section--Western lake section
MLRA--Central Iowa and Minnesota Till Prairies (103)
LRR M; southern Minnesota and north central Iowa
Extent--small

Series control section--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 150 centimeters (59.1 inches)

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 46 centimeters (18.1 inches) (Ap, A, and BA horizons)
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 46 to 79 centimeters (18.1 to 31.1 inches) (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)
udic moisture regime

Cation-exchange activity class in inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

It is questionable if the zone within 75 centimeters (29.5 inches) of the surface in this profile meets the requirements of an Aquic sub group.  This profile may better fit the Oxyaquic sub group.  Until another profile can be located and described, the classification will remain the same.
