CROSWELL SERIES

The Croswell series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits on ice margin complexes, stream terraces, lake terraces, low dunes, beach ridges, outwash plains, lake plains, and ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, isotic, frigid Oxyaquic Haplorthods

TYPICAL PEDON: Croswell sand, on a southwest facing, linear, 2 percent slope in a wooded area at an elevation of 354 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Neconish, Noseum, and Springstead series.  Neconish soils average 50 percent or more fine sand in the particle-size control section. Noseum soils have a loamy mantle 25 to 51 centimeters thick. Springstead soils have a densic contact within the series control section.  

Similar series include the Croswood, Cublake, Gilchrist, Halfaday, Heinz, Manitowish, and Mattix series. All of these soils have a mixed family mineralogy class. Croswood soils have till that averages less than 85 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Cublake soils have stratified material that averages less than 85 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Gilchrist soils have densic material within the series control section. Halfaday soils have colors with value and chroma less than 4 in the upper part of the spodic horizon. Heinz soils have a loamy mantle 13 to 38 centimeters thick and have colors with value and chroma less than 4 in the upper part of the spodic horizon. Manitowish soils have a loamy mantle 25 to 51 centimeters thick. Mattix soils have a loamy mantle 13 to 38 centimeters thick and more than 15 percent gravel in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Croswell soils are on ice margin complexes, stream terraces, lake terraces, low dunes, beach ridges, outwash plains, lake plains, and ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. These soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 680 to 920 mm. Mean annual temperature ranges from 5 to 9 degrees C. Frost-free period is 90 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Au Gres, Deford, Kalkaska, Kinross, and Rubicon soils. The excessively drained Rubicon, somewhat poorly drained Au Gres, and poorly and very poorly drained Deford soils form a common drainage sequence with the Croswell soils. The poorly drained and very poorly drained Kinross soils are in depressions. The somewhat excessively drained Kalkaska soils are on higher landscape positions. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The depth to the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from 60 to 100 cm between March and June and in October and November in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high. 

USE AND VEGETATION: MOst of these soils are forested. Some areas are idle cropland or in pasture. A small portion of these soils are cultivated with small grains and hay the principle crops. Native vegetation is intermixed hardwoods and conifers, predominantly quaking aspen, black cherry, paper birch, bigtooth aspen, red pine, eastern white pine, jack pine, northern red oak, and red maple. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 90A, 90B, 91B, 92, 93B, 94A, 94B, 94C, 94D, 95A, and 96 in the northern Lower Peninsula and Upper Peninsula of Michigan and northern Wisconsin. The type location is in MLRA 94A. These soils are extensive with about 474,000 acres of the series mapped.
