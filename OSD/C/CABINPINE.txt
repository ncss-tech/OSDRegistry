CABINPINE SERIES

The Cabinpine series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks. These soils are on floodplains and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm. The mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Fluventic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Cabinpine gravelly sand on a north-northwest facing aspect (338 degrees), 3 percent slope at an elevation of 1767 meters (5796 feet). When described on 4/18/2012 the soil was slightly moist throughout. Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted. The soil surface is covered by 10 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles.

   Oi--0 to 5 cm; slightly decomposed plant material composed of ponderosa pine needles.

   A1--5 to 20 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly sand; dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist, single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; common fine interstitial and fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (12 to 18 cm thick) 

   A2--20 to 25 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2)  gravelly coarse sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure;  soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and medium roots; many fine and medium interstitial pores; 20 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 15 cm thick) 

  2C1--25 to 44 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely gravelly coarse sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grain;  loose, nonsticky and nonplastic;  many very fine through coarse and few very coarse roots; many fine  and medium interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 20 cm thick)

   2C2--44 to 86 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely cobbly coarse sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots and very fine roots;  many fine and medium interstitial pores; 35 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (40 to 100 cm thick) 

  2C3--86 to 140 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely cobbly coarse sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots;  many fine and  medium interstitial pores; 35 percent gravel and 25 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6) (0 to 75 cm) 

TYPE LOCATION: Lincoln County, Nevada; 1,130 feet west and 5 feet north of southeast corner of section 9, T. 6 S., R. 69 E.; Fife Mountain, Nevada 7.5 minute quadrangle; 37 degrees, 26 minutes, 3 seconds north latitude and 114 degrees, 16 minutes, 24 seconds west longitude; UTM 741255 meters E, 4146538 meters N, zone 11; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 37.4342583 latitude, -114.2732222 longitude. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually moist in the moisture control section during the winter and early spring months; moist in some part from July through early September due convective thunderstorms; aridic soil moisture regime that borders on ustic.  These soils may have saturated layers within 200 cm of the mineral soil surface during the spring from snow melt.
Mean annual soil temperature: 11 to 14 degrees C.   
Mollic epipedon thickness: 25 to 35 cm. 
Depth to 2C horizons: 25 to 85 cm.
Mineralogy: 2 to 5 percent volcanic glass in the 0.02 to 2 mm fraction. 
Other features: Some pedons have an AC horizon above a depth of 85 cm.

Chroma: 2 or 3.
Clay content: 5 to 12 percent
Rock fragments: 15 to 35 percent, with 5 to 10 percent cobbles; 10 to 25 percent gravel.
Reaction: Neutral or slightly alkaline. 

2C1, 2C2 horizons
Value: 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3.

2C3 horizon 
Value: 4 through 7 dry; 2 through 4 moist
Chroma: 2 through 4
Texture: Coarse sand or sand.
Modifiers: Extremely gravelly or extremely cobbly.
Clay content: 1 to 5 percent

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cabinpine soils are on floodplains and stream terraces. These soils formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and other volcanic rocks. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 1,750 to 2,010 meters. The climate is dry, sub-humid with cool, moist winters and warm, intermittently moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 450 mm, the mean annual air temperature is 8 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 110 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Veet soils. Veet soils are loamy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Excessively drained; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Rarely flooded or very rarely flooded, and areas adjacent to streams may have a high water table and are subject to flooding during periods of high runoff and streamflow.

USE AND VEGETATION: Cabinpine soils are used mainly for forestland and recreation. The potential native vegetation is mainly Rocky Mountain Ponderosa pine, mountain big sagebrush, muttongrass, and some singleleaf pinyon and Utah juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Cabinpine soils are of small extent and occur in the northern drainages of the Clover Mountains in southeastern Nevada. MLRA 29.
