Slopes range from 5 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1520 milimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Capetown soils are on linear to concave or slightly convex positions on backslopes and footslopes on mountains. Slopes are 5 to 30 percent. Elevations range from 10 to 855 meters. These soils formed in colluvium derived from sandstone and mudstone. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1140 to 2280 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C. The frost-free period is about 240 to 330 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Caperidge (T) and Northbear (T) soils. Caperidge and Northbear soils do not have redoximorphic features within 150 centimeters. Caperidge soils contain more than 35 percent rock fragments and are found on convex to slightly concave positions on mountain slopes. Northbear soils are found on linear to concave or convex positions on mountain slopes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained; high or very high runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. A seasonal high water table occurs between 50 to 100 centimeters December through March.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for timber production, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Natural vegetation includes grand fir, Douglas-fir, tanoak, California laurel, red alder, poison oak, evergreen huckleberry, western swordfern, oceanspray, Douglas iris, and thimbleberry. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coastal Redwood Belt; MLRA 4B. The series is not extensive.
