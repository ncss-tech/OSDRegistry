CINDERSPRING SERIES

The Cinderspring series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess and mixed alluvium. Cinderspring soils are on undulating loess covered basalt plains and hills. Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 457 millimeters, and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Cinderspring gravelly silt loam, on a 10 percent slope on nonirrigated cropland at an elevation of 1908 meters. When described on November 17, 1989 the soil was moist to 15 cm and dry below. (Color is for air dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(0 to 25 cm thick)

2C--127 to 155 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravel, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; single grain; loose; few very fine roots; many fine, medium and coarse irregular and few fine vesicular pores; 90 percent gravel sized cinders; few (10 percent) distinct secondary calcium carbonate coats around rock fragments; slightly effervescent in some parts; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Fren(T), Iver, Kabear(T), Lobert, Ola, Redmount(T), Shively, Taterpa and Wagore series. Fren soils have 15 to 30 percent volcanic ash, do not have dominate silty materials in the upper particle-size control section, and have secondary carbonates at a depth of 50 to 90 cm. Iver soils do not have cinders in the particle size control section. Kabear soils have 4 to 14 percent clay and less than 5 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section. Lobert soils have more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser in the upper half of their particle-size control sections, average less than 15 percent rock fragments, and have weak durinodes in the lower part of the B or in the C horizon. Ola soils have a paralithic contact to granitic bedrock within depths of 100 cm. Redmount soils do not have a cambic horizon and have a very gravelly sandy loam 2C horizon. Shively soils do not have a cambic horizon, or dominantly silty materials in the upper particle-size control section, and have a paralithic contact at depths of 100 to 150 cm. Stripe soils are 50 to 100 cm deep to a lithic contact. Taterpa soils are 100 to 150 cm deep to paralithic contact. Wagore soils formed in colluvium from granite and do not have dominantly silty materials in the particle size control section.
