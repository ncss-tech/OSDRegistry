COSOSA SERIES

The Cososa series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in outwash derived from granite, gneiss, and mica schist.  Cososa soils are on outwash plains, outwash fans, and outwash terraces on an intermontane basin. Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 6 to 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Cososa loamy sand, 0 to 3 percent slopes in rangeland at an elevation of 7,500 feet. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)
