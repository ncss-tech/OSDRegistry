TAXONOMIC CLASS: Medial over loamy-skeletal, amorphic over mixed, superactive, acid Typic Cryaquands

TYPICAL PEDON:  Chunilna silt loam - on a level slope under paper birch forest at 450 feet elevation.  (All colors are for moist soil, all textures are apparent field textures)

    Oe--0 to 4 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) partially decomposed plant material; very strongly acid (pH 4.5).  (2 to 5 inches thick)

    A1--4 to 8 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) mucky silt loam with occasional lenses of yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) fine sandy loam lenses of volcanic ash; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; very strongly acid (pH 4.6); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)

    A2--8 to 13 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) silt loam with occasional lenses of yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) fine sandy loam and very fine sandy loam lenses of volcanic ash; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; very strongly acid (pH 4.8); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 5 inches thick)

    Bg--13 to 18 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common medium distinct dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) redoximorphic depletions; very strongly acid (pH 4.8); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 20 inches thick)

    2Bg--18 to 26 inches; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) gravelly loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 20 percent subangular gravel and 5 percent subangular cobble; common medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) redoximorphic concentrations; strongly acid (pH 5.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 12 inches thick)

    2C1--26 to 38 inches; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) very gravelly sandy loam; massive; friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 40 percent subangular gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.4); diffuse irregular boundary.  (10 to 22 inches thick)

    2C2--38 to 60 inches; olive gray (5Y 4/2) very gravelly sandy loam; massive; friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 40 percent subangular gravel and 5 percent subangular cobbles; strongly acid (pH 5.4).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this classification.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: volcanic ash influenced loess over gravelly glacial till deposits
Landform: depressions on till plains, depressions on hill, and depressions on mountains
Slopes: 0 to 20 percent
Mean annual temperature: about 33 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: about 28 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Talkeetna and Tokositna soils. Both soils are well drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly or poorly drained. Runoff is rapid. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the solum and moderately low to moderately high in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used primarily as wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is dominantly paper birch, white spruce and bluejoint reedgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Cook Inlet Lowlands MLRA 224, South-central Alaska.  The series is of moderated extent.
