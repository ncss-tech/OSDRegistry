CRANDALL SERIES

The Crandall series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from conglomerate.  Crandall soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Xeric Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Crandall gravelly loam , on a southeast facing, convex, 50 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 10,200 feet.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on September 9, 1996, the soil was moist from 10 to 24 inches.

The surface is covered by 25 percent gravel, 15 percent cobble and 1 percent stone.

    A1--0 to 5 inches; very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) dry; weak fine granular structure; soft very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, few fine and medium roots; many very fine pores; 1 percent stones, 10 percent cobbles and 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); nonefferscent; clear smooth boundary (3 to 8 inches thick).

    A2--5 to 14 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 5/3) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, few fine, and medium roots; many very fine pores; 1 percent stones, 10 percent cobbles; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); nonefferescent; clear wavy boundary (5 to 12 inches thick).

    Bt--14 to 45 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) very cobbly clay loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) dry; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent stones, 15 percent cobbles, 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); noneffervescent; clear wavy boundary.  (25 to 35 inches thick)

    Bk--45 to 55 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) very cobbly loam, light brown (7.5 6/4) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine pores; 5 percent stones; 20 percent cobbles, 30 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt irregular boundary (5 to 15 inches thick).

    R--55 inches; conglomerate bedrock
