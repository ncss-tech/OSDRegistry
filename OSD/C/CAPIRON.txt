CAPIRON SERIES

The Capiron series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources. These soils are in drainageways and inset fans. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 380 mm, and the mean annual temperature is 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Fluvaquentic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Capiron loam, in rangeland on a 2 percent slope at 1,056 meters elevation (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated).

    A1--0 to 10 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular and tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual smooth boundary. 

    A2--10 to 25 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate coarse granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and medium roots; many fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizons is 25 to 46 cm)

    C1--25 to 38 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; common fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (14 to 45 cm thick) 

    C2--38 to 56 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) coarse sand, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 31 cm thick) 

    Ab--56 to 81 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; single grain; very friable, soft, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; common fine irregular and interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 49 cm thick) 

    C'--81 to 152 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) very gravelly sand, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine interstitial pores; 5 percent coarse distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) moist iron concentrations and 5 percent coarse distinct light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) moist iron depletions; 45 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8).

COMPETING SERIES: 
There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform - drainageways and inset fans  
Slopes - 0 to 8 percent
Elevation - 990 to 1,485 meters
Parent material - alluvium derived from mixed sources 
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers 
Mean annual precipitation - 330 to 432 mm
Mean annual air temperature - 4 to 7 degrees C 
Frost-free period - 70 to 115 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed.   

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; moderate permeability to 38 cm and moderately rapid and very rapid below. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used primarily for pasture, rangeland, and wildlife habitat. Vegetation is chiefly mixed grasses, small grains, and minor acreages of other specialty crops. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Capiron series is of small extent in the intermountain valleys of southwestern Montana. MLRA 44A.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Bitterroot Valley Area, Montana, 2013; proposed in Ravalli County, Montana, 2009.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon - from 0 to 25 cm (A1 and A2 horizons)
Redox depletions and concentrations - from 81 to 152 cm (C' horizon)
Particle-size control section - from 25 to 100 cm (C1, C2, Ab, and part of the C' horizons)

Capiron soils have a frigid temperature regime, an ustic moisture regime, and an aquic moisture subclass.
