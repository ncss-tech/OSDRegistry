CATGULCH SERIES 

The Catgulch series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from granite or other coarse grained igneous rocks, gneiss or schist. These soils are on bedrock-floored plains, mountains, and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Catgulch gravelly sandy clay loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 5 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly sandy clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; many very fine and common fine interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 9 inches thick) 

    Bw1--5 to 9 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly  sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine and fine pores; 35 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. 

    Bw2--9 to 12 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine pores; 45 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); abrupt smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of Bw1 and Bw2 horizons is 5 to 15 inches.) 

    Cr--12 to 15 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) decomposed granitic bedrock that crushes to very gravelly loamy coarse sand; neutral (pH 6.8). (2 to 8 inches thick) 

    R--15 inches; hard granite bedrock.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Catgulch soils are used primarily for rangeland and woodland.  The potential native vegetation is mainly Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, rough fescue, Sandberg bluegrass, mountain big sagebrush, and rubber rabbitbrush.  Areas with a forest canopy have an overstory of ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, and limber pine and an understory of Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, big sagebrush, and Rocky mountain juniper. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Catgulch soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana. MLRA 43B.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Gallatin County, Montana, 1997; proposed in Jefferson County, Montana, 1993.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1551, MT3044.  
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  
Mollic epipedon - from the soil surface to 9 inches (A, Bw1 horizons); 
Cambic horizon - from 9 to 12 inches (Bw2 horizon); 
Particle-size control section - from the soil surface to 12 inches (A, Bw1, Bw2 horizons); 
Paralithic contact - layer of decomposed granite bedrock (grus) from 12 to 15 inches (Cr horizon); 
Lithic contact - hard granite bedrock at 15 inches (R horizon).  

Catgulch soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
