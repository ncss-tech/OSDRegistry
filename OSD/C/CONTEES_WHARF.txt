COMPETING SERIES: None.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landscape:  Northern Coastal Plain estuaries
Landform:  Estuarine channels, estuarine tidal creek channels, and mainland coves
Parent Material:  Fine-silty, glauconitic estuarine deposits
Slope:  0 to 3 percent
Mean Annual Air Temperature:  50 to 59 degrees F. (10 to 15 degrees C.)
Mean Annual Water Temperature:  52 to 58 degrees F. (11 to 14 degrees C.)
Water Depth Range:  0 to 14.8 feet (0 to 4.5 meters)
Water Regime:  Tidal, 0 to 1 foot (0 to 0.3 meters) tidal range
Water Salinity Range:  7 to 15 ppt

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  
Muddy Creek soils-occur on similar landforms but have buried organic horizons between 100 and 200 centimeters
Rhode River soils-occur on wave-cut platforms, are coarse-loamy throughout and have a pre-Holocene contact within 100 cm of the soil surface
Sellman soils-occur on similar landforms but have a fine particle size family class.
Tingles soils-contain sulfidic materials within 50 cm of the soil surface and occur in MLRA 153D in coastal bays and lagoons with higher salinity ranges.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage Class:  Subaqueous drainage
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity:  Low to moderately low
Soil Moisture Regime:  Peraquic
Soil is permanently submerged / continuously inundated with brackish water.  The presence of hypo-sulfidic materials within 50 cm of the soil surface puts these soils at risk for potential acid sulfate soil formation if they are dredged and exposed to the air. 

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Major Uses:  Areas of this soil are used for recreational fishing, swimming, and boating. Commercial uses include shell fishing and aquaculture. 
Dominant Vegetation:  Benthic fauna such as clams, blue crabs, and oysters are associated with this soil. Eelgrass (Zostera marina), sea lettuce (Ulva sp.), and horned pondweed (Zannichellia palustris) may occur on these soils.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE:  Raleigh, North Carolina. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Atlantic Coastal Plain sub-estuaries of the western portion of the Chesapeake Bay.  MLRA 149A.  This series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Anne Arundel County, Maryland, 2018.

REMARKS:  This subaqueous series is named for Contees Wharf in the Rhode River sub-estuary of Chesapeake Bay and areas of mapping were formerly included with water.

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon-the zone from 0 to 79 centimeters (Ase horizon)
Peraquic feature-the zone from 0 to 268 centimeters is permanently saturated
Hypo-sulfidic materials-the zone from 0 to 268 centimeters
Hyper-sulfidic materials-the zone from 126 to 268 centimeters
