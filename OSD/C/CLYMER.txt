REMARKS:  Classification was changed on the previous revision from fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Typic Hapludults to coarse-loamy, siliceous, active, mesic Typic Hapludults based on analysis of lab data from states involved, including data on the typifying pedon.

Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 inches) (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 20 to 61 cm (8 to 24 inches) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)

This edit updates the previous format to the current semi-tabular format and updates the Range of Individual Horizons, RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS, COMPETING SERIES, GEOGRAPHIC SETTING, GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS, USE AND VEGETATION, DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT, DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY, and REMARKS sections
