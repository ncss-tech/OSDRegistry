COUCH SERIES

The Couch series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and alluvium from basic volcanic and tuffaceous rock. These soils are on old lake terraces, lake plains and basin floor remnants. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 229 millimeters (9 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C. (48 degrees F.).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Couch soils are on smooth old lake terraces, lake plains and basin floor remnants. They formed in alluvium derived mainly from basic volcanic and tuffaceous rock sources. Elevations are 1,310 to 1,615 meters (4,300 to 5,750 feet). Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The climate is cool, semiarid. Mean annual precipitation is 203 to 254 millimeters (8 to 10 inches). The mean annual temperature is about 7 to 9 degrees C. (45 to 49 degrees F). The frost-free period is 80 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hussa, Nevadash, and Zorravista soils. Hussa soils are somewhat poorly and poorly drained and have ashy control section textures. Nevadash soils have mollic epipedons and ashy control section textures. Zorravista soils have sandy control sections.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well-drained; high runoff; Permeability is slow; saturated hydraulic conductivity class is moderately low to moderately high. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for livestock grazing. A limited area, that has water available for irrigation, has been cultivated to alkali tolerant grasses or barley. Typically, native vegetation is dominated by greasewood, spiny hopsage, big sagebrush, and occasional saltgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: These soils occur in northeastern California and in adjoining portions of Nevada. They are of small extent. MLRA 23.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Modoc County, California, 1971.

REMARKS: Series reclassified in January, 2006, to recognize the influence of ashy material in the coarse silt and sand fraction above and below the natric horizon. Formerly classified as a Xeric Natrargids.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon - 0 to 3 centimeters (A horizon).
Natric horizon - The zone from 3 to 56 centimeters (the Btn1, Btn2, Btnky horizons).
Vitrixerandic feature - The cumulative zone 23 centimeters thick within the upper 75 centimeters that has more than 30 percent glass in the coarse silt and sand fractions (A and part of the 2C1 horizons).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 3 to 53 centimeters (Btn1, Btn2, part of the Btnky horizons).
