The Clewiston series consists of moderately deep, very poorly and poorly drained soils that formed in a thin layer of organic material and marine sandy sediments over limestone bedrock. Clewiston soils are on fresh water marshes, swamps, and low broad flats on marine terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 23 degrees C. (74 degrees F.), and the mean annual precipitation is about 1270 millimeters (50 inches).

TYPICAL PEDON:  Clewiston muck in cropland, 0.5 percent slope. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated).

   Oap--0 to 23 centimeters (0 to 9 inches); black (10YR 2/1) muck; about 30 percent fiber unrubbed and about 5 percent fiber rubbed; weak medium angular blocky structure; very friable, soft; many fine roots throughout; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. [20 to 41 centimeters (8 to 16 inches) thick]

   A--23 to 48 centimeters (9 to 19 inches); very dark gray (10YR 3/1) fine sand; weak fine granular; very friable, soft; common fine roots throughout; neutral; gradual wavy boundary. [8 to 25 centimeters (3 to 10 inches) thick]

   Cg--48 to 84 centimeters (19 to 33 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sand; single grain; loose; about 5 percent gravel by volume; slightly alkaline; abrupt irregular boundary. [23 to 86 centimeters (9 to 34 inches) thick]

   2R--84 to 109 centimeters (35 to 45 inches); weakly to strongly cemented rippable limestone bedrock with solution holes.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Sanibel series.
Sanibel soils--lack bedrock at depths less than 203 centimeters (80 inches) and are on similar landform positions.    

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landscape: Southern Florida Flatwoods
Landform(s): Talfs and/or dips in fresh water marshes and swamps 
Parent material: organic materials formed from remains of hydrophytic herbaceous plant overlying limestone bedrock. 
Mean annual air temperature: 25 to 27 degrees C (77 to 78 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 127 to 165 centimeters (50 to 65 inches) 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: In addition to the competing Sanibel soils, these are:
Basinger soils--have weakly defined spodic horizons, lack bedrock at depths less than 203 centimeters (80 inches), and are on slightly higher landform positions.
Dania soils--are composed entirely of sapric materials over limestone, have bedrock at depths less than 51 centimeters (20 inches), and occur on similar landform positions.
Lauderhill soils--are composed entirely of sapric materials over limestone, have bedrock at depths of 51 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches), and occur on similar landform positions.
Margate soils--have mollic epipedons, lack muck at the surface, and occur on slightly higher landform positions.

Hydric Indicators: A2 Histic Epipedon, A3 Black Histic, A6 Organic Bodies, and A8 Muck Presence

USE AND VEGETATION:  
Major Uses: Wildlife habitat, rangeland, cropland, pasture, and urban land.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE:  Auburn, Alabama.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Florida Flatwoods.  This soil is of limited extent

SERIES Proposed: Hendry County, Florida; 2019.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:

1.	Particle-size control section: 25 to 102 centimeters (10 to 40 inches)
2.	Histic epipedon: 0 to 25 centimeters (0 to 10 inches) (Oa horizons)
3.	Lithic contact: 84 to 109 centimeters (35 to 45 inches) (2R horizon)

These soils were formerly classified as Typic Psammaquents based on the mineral soil beneath the Histic epipedon.  Amendment Notice no. 1 of NSTH now classifies these soils as Inceptisols.

This soil was previously mapped as Plantation. Plantation soils were established in Broward County and is now classified as isohyperthermic. Clewiston is replacing Plantation in the hyperthermic temperature regime.
