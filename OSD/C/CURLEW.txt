CURLEW SERIES

The Curlew series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on flood plains and in drainageways. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Curlew silt loam, in pasture on a 1 percent slope at 1,053 meters elevation (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oe--0 to 8 cm; mucky peat; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 12 cm thick)

    A--8 to 41 cm; black (10YR 2/1) silt loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; moderate coarse granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and few medium roots; many fine tubular pores; 10 percent fine distinct strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) redox concentrations; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (28 to 38 cm thick) 

    C1--41 to 61 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly sandy loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; common fine tubular and interstitial pores; 20 percent medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) redox concentrations and 30 percent medium distinct dark gray (10YR 4/1) redox depletions; 17 percent gravel: neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (20 to 56 cm thick)

   C2--61 to 152 cm; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) very gravelly sand, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) dry; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine irregular and interstitial pores; 40 percent medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) redox concentrations and 2 percent fine grayish brown (10YR 5/2) redox depletions; 40 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6)
