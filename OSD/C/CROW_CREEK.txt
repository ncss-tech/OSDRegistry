CROW CREEK SERIES

The Crow Creek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess deposits. Crow Creek soils are on hills. Slopes are 1 to 40 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Crow Creek silt loam, rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A1--0 to 2 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly stick; many very fine and fine, common medium roots; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 7 inches thick)

    A2--2 to 9 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate coarse and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky; many very fine and fine, common medium roots; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 8 inches thick)

    Bw--9 to 14 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate coarse and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky, common fine and few medium roots; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 10 inches thick)

    Ck1--14 to 20 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky; common fine, few medium roots; calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Ck2--20 to 24 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) silt loam, light gray (10YR 7/2) moist; massive; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 5 inches thick)

    Ck3--24 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

TYPE LOCATION: Teton County, Wyoming; NW1/4 of the NW1/4 of sec. 4, T.41N., R.115W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon is 7 to 15 inches. Depth to calcareous material ranges from 0 to 14 inches. The solum is 10 to 24 inches thick. The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F. The control section is silt loam or very fine sandy loam, and averages less than 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.

The A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. This horizon is neutral or slightly alkaline.

The Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. This horizon is slightly or moderately alkaline.

The Ck horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 6 to 8 dry, 4 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist. It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. This horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 1 to 14 percent.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Crow Creek soils are on gently sloping to steep hills. Slopes are 1 to 40 percent. The soils formed in loess. Elevation is 6,000 to 7,500 feet. The mean annual precipitation is about 15 to 21 inches. The mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees to 42 degrees F. The frost-free season is less than 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Lantonia and Tetonia soils, and the Robana and Willow Creek soils. Robana and Willow Creek soils have an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate to rapid runoff; moderately permeable.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for dry cropland, irrigated cropland, rangeland, homesites and other community uses, recreation, and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is low rabbitbrush, big sagebrush, slender wheatgrass, bluegrass, sedges, and green needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: In the intermountain valleys and hills of western Wyoming and southeastern Idaho. The series is of small extent.
