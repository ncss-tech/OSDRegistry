CRIB SERIES

The Crib series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium over glaciofluvial deposits derived from sedimentary and quartzite rocks.  Crib soils are on strath terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Crib loam, on an east facing, 1 percent slope in pasture grasses at an elevation of 5,545 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Bk2--18 to 28 inches; pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) clay loam, pink (7.5YR 7/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; violently effervescent, (37 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated and segregated as many very coarse soft masses and few coarse calcite crystals; 5 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual smooth boundary.

    Bk3--28 to 42 inches; pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) clay loam, pink (7.5YR 7/4) moist; massive; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; violently effervescent, (39 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated and segregated as many very coarse soft masses and few fine and medium calcite crystals; 5 percent cobbles, 5 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (combined thickness of Bk horizons range from 25 to 52 inches)

    2Bk4--42 to 60 inches; pink (7.5YR 8/4) extremely cobbly sandy clay loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine, few fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent, (39 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated and segregated as common coarse soft masses; 40 percent cobbles, 30 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Uintah County, Utah; about 1.3 miles northwest of Montes Reservoir; located about 2,600 feet west and 1,850 feet south of the northeast corner of sec. 26, T. 1 S., R. 1 W., USBM; Roosevelt, Utah USGS quad; lat. 40 degrees 22 minutes 11 seconds N. and long. 109 degrees 57 minutes 44 seconds W., NAD 27

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture:  The soil moisture control section is affected by precipitation that falls evenly throughout the year with a slight increase in the late summer and early fall.  The soil moisture regime is aridic with aquic conditions.

Mean annual soil temperature:  47 to 52 degrees F.

Particle-size control section (weighted average):  10 to 18 percent silicate clay with 18 to 35 percent total clay; 0 to 15 percent rounded gravel and cobbles from sandstone and quartzite

Depth to lithologic discontinuity:  40 to 57 inches to layers with greater than 35 percent rock fragments.

Depth to calcic horizon:  8 to 24 inches

Depth to endosaturation:  1.5 to 3.5 feet to irrigation induced saturation during the months of April through December.

A horizon:  (combination of colors and thickness do not meet mollic criteria)
Value:  4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma:  3 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Rock fragments:  0 to 10 percent rounded gravel and cobbles
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  1 to 10 percent
Reaction:  moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline

Bk horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR
Value:  5 to 8 dry, 4 to 8 moist
Chroma:  1 to 4 dry, 3 to 6 moist
Texture:  fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam
Rock fragments:  0 to 15 percent rounded gravel and cobbles
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  15 to 55 percent (averaging 15 to 40 percent in pscs)
Reaction:  moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline 

2Bk horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR
Value:  4 to 8 dry, 4 to 7 moist
Chroma:  2 to 4 dry, 4 to 6 moist
Texture:  very gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly sandy clay loam, very cobbly sandy clay loam, extremely cobbly fine sandy loam, or extremely cobbly sandy clay loam

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Lind and Yonic series.  Yonic and Lind soils do not have lithologic discontinuities with layers that have greater than 35 percent rock fragments.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Parent material:  alluvium over glaciofluvial deposits derived from sedimentary and quartzite rocks.
Landform:  strath terraces
Slopes:  1 to 3 percent
Elevation: 4,900 to 6,300 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  45 to 49 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  5 to 12 inches.
Frost-free period:  110 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Abracon, Clapper, Cobbra, and Hazmaz series.  

Abracon and Cobbra soils occur on strath terraces and fan remnants and are well drained and do not have an irrigation induced water table.

Clapper soils are on fan remnants and have a loamy-skeletal pscs.

Hazmaz soils are on structural benches and are moderately deep to petrocalcic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained, low runoff, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major use is irrigated pasture.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Utah.  LRR D, MLRA 34.  This series is of small extent.
