CLYDE SERIES

The Clyde series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils formed in 75 to 150 centimeters of loamy glacial outwash or erosional sediments and the underlying loamy till. These soils are on nearly level positions, swales and concave drainageways on interfluves on dissected till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 840 millimeters.

USE AND VEGETATION:
Where artificially drained, Clyde soils are cultivated. The principal crops are corn, soybeans, small grains, and legume hay.  Where not artificially drained, Clyde soils are pastured. The native vegetation is big bluestem, western wheatgrass, sedges, blue grama and other species of the tall grass prairie that are tolerant of excessive wetness.

cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 58 to 200 centimeters (Bg1, Bg2, Bg3, 2BCg, and 2BC horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Some pedons have vertical seams or wedges of sand or loamy sand about 5 to 30 centimeters wide and about 0.9 to 1.2 meters deep extending downward from the stone line into the till.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
