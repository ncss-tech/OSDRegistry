CASTELL SERIES

The Castell series consists of soils that are well drained, and moderately deep to gneiss bedrock. These soils formed in residuum weathered from gneiss of pre-Cambrian age. These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on footslopes of ridges and hills on dissected plains of the Central Basin.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in) and mean annual temperature is about 19 degrees C (66 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, semiactive, thermic Typic Paleustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Castell sandy loam, in rangeland.
     (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in); brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; very hard and massive when dry, very hard, friable; common fine roots; common fine pores; 2 percent, 2 to 5 mm, quartz gravel, non-flat, subangular, indurated; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. (Thickness of the A horizon is 15 to 48 cm [6 to 19 in])

    Bt1--20 to 43 cm (8 to 17 in); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm; common fine roots; common fine pores; 10 percent clay films on faces of peds; 2 percent, 2 to 20 mm, quartz gravel, non-flat, subangular, indurated; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. 

    Bt2--43 to 76 cm (17 to 30 in); strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) sandy clay, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist; 10 percent fine distinct reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) mottles; moderate medium subangular block structure; very hard, firm, few fine roots; few fine pores; 30 percent clay films on faces of peds; 2 percent, 2 to 5 mm, quartz gravel, non-flat, subangular, indurated; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 20 to 85 cm [8 to 33 in])

    Cr--76 to 107 cm (30 to 42 in); moderately cemented, weathered pinkish gneiss, that becomes harder with depth.

COMPETING SERIES: The only series in the same family is Weswind. Similar soils are Hamby (TX), Katemcy (TX), Ligon (TX), Pedernales (TX), Shatruce (TX), Voca (TX), Wichita (TX), and Winters (TX).
These soils, except Shatruce soils, have solum thicker than 100 cm (40 in), and all of these soils formed in parent material from other than gneiss bedrock.
Katemcy soils: do not have an abrupt texture change.
Ligon and Shatruce soils: have hues of 5YR or redder in the argillic horizon.
Pedernales and Winters soils: have identifiable secondary carbonates at depths of 72 to 127 cm (28 to 50 in).
Voca soils: are greater than 150 cm (60 in) to bedrock.
Weswind soils: are greater than 150 cm (60 in) to claystone bedrock or dense clay.
Wichita soils: have secondary carbonates within 72 cm (28 in) and have a calcic horizon within 100 to 150 cm (40 to 60 in).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: Residuum weathered from pre-Cambrian gneiss bedrock. 
Landscape: Dissected plains
Landform: undulating plains and footslopes of ridges and hills
Slope: 0 to 5 percent
Precipitation Pattern: The majority of the yearly amount occurs during the fall and spring months. The winter and summer months are normally drier.
Mean annual precipitation: 686 to 838 mm (27 to 33 in)
Thornthwaite P-E Index: 37 to about 44
Mean annual air temperature: 18.3 to 19.4 degrees C (65 to 67 degrees F)
Frost free days: 210 to 240
Elevation: 243.8 to 579.1 m (800 to 1,900 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Keese and the competing Katemcy, Ligon, and Voca series.
Katemcy and Voca soils: occur on similar positions.
Keese soils: Do not have an argillic horizon, are shallow to granite bedrock, and occur on backslopes, shoulders, and summits of hills and ridges.
Ligon soils: occur on summits, shoulders, and backslopes of hills and ridges. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderately slow to slow. Runoff is low on slopes less than 1 percent and medium on 1 to 5 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for rangeland. Small areas farmed to small grain and sorghums for grazing and hay. Native vegetation consists of little bluestem, purpletop, sand lovegrass, and sideoats grama grasses with scattering of post oak and live oak trees. In many places the vegetation is mesquite trees, whitebrush, Texas persimmon trees, tasajillo, grasses such as threeawn, sand dropseed, fringeleaf paspalum, and numerous forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Texas; Southwest Plateaus and Plains Range and Cotton Region, LLR I; MLRA 82A-Texas Central Basin. This series is extensive with about 100,000 acres.
