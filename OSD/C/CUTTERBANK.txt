CUTTERBANK SERIES

The Cutterbank series consists of very shallow and shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in non-marine sediments derived from granite. Cutterbank soils are on eroded backslopes of uplifted lakebed sediments. Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 150 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, thermic, shallow Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Cutterbank fine sandy loam on a convex, 38 percent slope at an elevation of 1,015 meters. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The surface is covered by 10 percent fine gravel, 40 percent medium and coarse gravel, 3 percent cobbles, 1 percent stones, and 1 percent boulders.

      Cdk2--66 to 78 centimeters (26 to 31 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots in fractures greater than 10 centimeters apart; common very fine interstitial pores;  10 percent fine gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.

	Cdk3--78 to 150 centimeters (31 to 60 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) stratified loamy coarse sand to sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; moderately hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; very few very fine roots in fractures greater than 10 centimeters apart; 10 percent fine gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4). (Combined thickness of the C horizons is greater than 100 centimeters).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Calwash (NV), Chinkle (NV), Cochora (CA), Cougarbutte (T CA), and Randsberg (CA) series. Calwash, Chinkle, Cochora, Cougarbutte, and Randsberg are shallow to paralithic contacts and are formed from colluvium over residuum. In addition, Calwash soils have 20 to 26 percent clay and 20 to 35 percent calcium carbonate equivalence in the fine earth fraction. Chinkle soils also are moist in some part of the moisture control section for very brief intermittent periods in summer and fall, 10 to 20 days cumulative following summer convection storms. Cochora soils also have a mean annual soil temperature of 17 to 19 degrees C. Cougarbutte soils also form from granitic parent materials, and are moist in some part for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October following summer convection storms.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Cutterbank soils are on eroded backslopes of uplifted lakebed sediments. Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent. These soils formed from non-marine sediments derived from granite. Elevations are 670 to 1,200 meters. The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 125 to 175 millimeters; mean annual air temperature is 17 to 20 degrees C. The frost-free season is 200 to 270 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Koehn (T) and Dovecanyon (T) soils. Koehn soils are located in drainageways and on stream terraces and are sandy throughout the control section. Dovecanyon soils are located on fan remnants and have an argillic horizon. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat excessively drained; very high runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity in the subsoil and moderately low in the underlying material.

USE AND VEGETATION: Cutterbank soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly blackbrush, creosotebush, and white bursage. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwest Mojave desert of southern California, U.S.A.; MLRA 30. These soils are of moderate extent.
