CHILEROJO SERIES

The Chilerojo series consists of well drained soils that are very deep to a densic contact. They formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Chilerojo soils are on footslopes on interfluves of undulating plains. Slopes are 5 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Haplargids

Buckle, Los Alamos, Mentmore, and Quagwa soils have hues of 7.5 YR or yellower. 
Spenlo soils have a calcic horizon and should be reclassified as a Calciargid. 
Doakum, Oelop, Palacid, Penistaja, and Redpen soils do not have a densic contact within 80 inches. 
Gapbutte, Gapmesa, Hagerman, and Hagerwest soils are moderately deep.
Tamarindo soils are greater than 40 inches to the base of the argillic.

A series that would be a competitor if assigned a superactive activity class is the Gaddes series. Gaddes soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact of weathered granite.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Chilerojo soils are on footslopes on interfluves of undulating plains. They formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale of the Triassic Age Chinle Formation. Slopes are 5 to 8 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,200 to 7,000 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Arojomil, Clovis, Frajillo, Ildefonso, and Kinsell soils. Arojomil soils are moderately deep to a petrocalcic horizon and are on summits and shoulders of undulating plateaus. Clovis soils have a calcic horizon and occur on backslopes and footslopes. Frajillo soil are loamy, have mollic epipedons, and occur on shoulders and backslopes of undulating plains. Ildefonso soils are loamy-skeletal, have a calcic horizon, and occur on shoulders and backslopes. Kinsell soils are fine-silty, have a mollic epipedon, and are on floodplains and channels of valley floors.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; runoff is medium; permeability is moderately slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: Chilerojo soils are used for livestock grazing, recreation, and wildlife habitat. Present vegetation is blue grama, sand dropseed, galleta, ring muhly, bud sagebrush, Bigelow sagebrush, tree cholla, and whipple cholla.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Chilerojo soils are of small extent in the northeastern part of the Estancia Basin in the Mexican Highland section of the Basin and Range physiographic province in northcentral New Mexico, MLRA 70C.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona. 

SERIES PROPOSED: Santa Fe County, New Mexico; Santa Fe Area Soil Survey Update; 2002. Chilerojo is a coined name from the Spanish words meaning red chile.
