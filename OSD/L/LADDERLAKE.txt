LADDERLAKE SERIES

The Ladderlake series consists of very deep, poorly or very poorly drained soils formed in organic material over alluvium and/or till derived from granitic rocks. The Ladderlake soils are on flood-plain steps on glacial valley floors and cirque floors of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 865 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 1 degree C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ladderlake soils are on flood-plain steps of glacial valley floors and cirque floors. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. These soils formed in organic material over alluvium and/or till derived from granite and granodiorite. Elevation is 2500 to 3885 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 505 to 1680 mm and the mean annual air temperature is -2 to 5 degrees C. The frost free season is 40 to 95 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Littlepete soils. The Littlepete soils are poorly or very poorly drained soils on floodplains; they lack histic epipedons, and average less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly or very poorly drained, high saturated hydraulic conductivity, occasional to frequent flooding for very brief to long (4 hrs to 30 days) duration from May to July, occasional to frequent ponding for long (7 to 30 days) duration from May to July. Seasonal high water table at 0 to 25 cm.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Vegetation is Sierra and alpine willow, blueberry, dwarf bilberry, bog laurel, shootingstar, spikerush, aster, sedge, and Idaho bentgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. These soils are not extensive.
