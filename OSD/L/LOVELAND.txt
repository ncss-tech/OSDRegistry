LOVELAND SERIES

The Loveland series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils formed in alluvial sediments derived from a variety of rock sources.  These neaarly level to sloping soils are on flood plains and low terraces along the smaller streams draining the Rocky Mountain areas.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Fluvaquentic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Loveland clay loam - grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

  A--0 to 11 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable; calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 14 inches thick)

  Ag--11 to 20 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) light clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to fine granules; slightly hard, very friable, plastic; peds are hard, firm; calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 10 inches thick)

  Ckzg--20 to 30 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) light clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) mottles; massive; hard, friable, plastic; some secondary calcium carbonate occurring as concretions, and calcium sulfate occurring as crystals; calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); gradual wavy boundary. (8 to 28 inches thick)

  2Cg--30 to 60 inches; very gravelly sand; many redoximorphic features with strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist.

TYPE LOCATION: Boulder County, Colorado; approximately 70 feet east and 250 feet north of W1/4 corner Sec. 11, T. 2 N., R. 69 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: moist for more than 60 but less than 90 consecutive days in the moisture control section 
Mean annual soil temperature: 47 to 58 degrees F.  
Depth to mollic epipedon: 12 to 24 inches 
Depth to calcic horizon: 12 to 24 inches 
Depth to the sand and gravel substratum: 20 to 40 inches 

Particle-size control section (weighted average): 
Clay content: 18 to 35 percent 
Silt content: 20 to 55 percent
Sand content: 20 to 50 percent 
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent 
Size: gravel

A horizon:
Hue: 5Y to 7.5YR 
Value: 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist 
Chroma: 1 to 3 
Reaction: moderately or strongly alkaline 

C horizon:
Hue: 5Y to 7.5YR 
Reaction: moderately or strongly alkaline 
Note: Accumulation of carbonate is absent in some pedons below depths of 20 inches.  Pebbles range from 20 to 55 percent in the IIC horizon or contrasting layer.

COMPETING SERIES:
The current competitors are the Lex, Swope and Woofus series.
The Lex soils are usually moist for more than 90 consecutive days when the soil temperature at 20 inches is 41 degrees F.
Lex soils receive 22 or more inches of mean annual precipitation.
Swope and Woofus soils are dry for longer periods in the soil moisture control section. 
Swope soils have less than 25 percent gravel in the 2C horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent Material: alluvial sediments 
Landform: flood plains and low terraces 
Slope: 0 to about 6 percent 
Mean annual temperature: 48 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 15 to 18 inches 
Note: Fluctuating water tables keep the soil saturated for a part of each year.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Calkins and Niwot soils.
Calkins oils are coarse-loamy and have argillic epipedons 24 to 50 inches thick.
Niwot soils are noncalcareous throughout.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage: somewhat poorly drained
Runoff: low 
Permeability: moderate 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used as native pastureland and for irrigated crops. Principal native vegetation is Junegrass, bluegrass, and blue grama.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central portions of Colorado bordering the front range.  The series is of moderate extent.
