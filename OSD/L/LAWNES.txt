LAWNES SERIES

The Lawnes series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, moderately permeable soils on tidal marshes. The soils formed in alluvial sediments. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 59 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, nonacid, thermic Typic Sulfaquents

TYPICAL PEDON: Lawnes mucky sandy loam - in a brackish marsh wildlife area.

  A--0 to 13 inches, dark gray (10YR 4/1) mucky sandy loam; common medium distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) accumulations; massive, weak fine granular structure when dry; slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many fine and medium fibrous roots; herbaceous plant material; soil flows easily between fingers when squeezed; n-value greater than 1.0; 0.115 percent sulfur; SAR 7.2 cmol/liter; moderately acid, extremely acid upon drying and moist incubation; clear smooth boundary. (8 to 24 inches thick)

  Cg1--13 to 26 inches, dark gray (5Y 4/1) mucky sandy loam; common medium prominent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) accumulations; massive; slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; herbaceous plant material; soil flows easily between fingers when squeezed; n-value greater than 1.0; 0.078 percent sulfur; SAR 5.2 cmol/liter; moderately acid, extremely acid upon drying and moist incubation; diffuse smooth boundary.

  Cg2--26 to 40 inches, dark gray (5Y 4/1) sandy loam; common medium prominent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) accumulations; massive; slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few fine roots; soil flows between fingers with some difficulty; n-value between 0.7 and 1.0; 0.064 percent sulfur; SAR 12.5 cmol/liter; moderately acid, extremely acid upon drying and moist incubation; diffuse smooth boundary.

  Cg3--40 to 80 inches, dark gray (5Y 4/1) stratified coarse sand and sandy loam; massive; nonsticky, nonplastic; moderately acid, extremely acid upon drying.

TYPE LOCATION: Surry County, Virginia; 1.1 miles southwest of the junction of VA-31 and VA-637, and 3.0 miles southeast of the junction of VA-610 and VA-618, at Scotland, along Grays Creek in Grays Creek Marsh.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Thickness: Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  
Reaction: Strongly acid through neutral, extremely acid upon drying and moist incubation.
Electrical conductivity: less than 8 dS/m.
Soluble Ca, Mg, K, and Na: less than 80 cmol/liter of saturation extract in more than half upper 1 meter of soil.
N-value: greater than 0.7 to a depth of 20 inches.
Jarosite mottles: Throughout the profile of some pedons after a moist incubation period.
Organic surface layers: less than 16 inches thick in some pedons.

O horizon, (where present):
Color--hue of 10YR to 5GY, or is neutral, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 0 to 2
Organic materials: Sapric, hemic

A horizon:
Color--hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2
Texture (fine-earth fraction)--sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam

Cg horizon:
Color--hue of 10YR to 5GY, or is neutral, value of 2 to 5,and chroma of 0 to 2
Texture: (fine-earth fraction)--Stratified and variable; clay content less than 18 percent. Below 40 inches, thin layers of mucky sandy clay loam, mucky silty clay loam, mucky clay 
loam, or buried organic material are in some pedons.

COMPETING SERIES:  
This is the Axis series is in the same family. Axis soils have a SAR greater than 13.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lawnes soils are along rivers and creeks in brackish tidal marshes, and are alternately inundated by fresh water and brackish water. The soils formed in alluvial sediments. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 38 to 46 inches, and mean annual 
temperature ranges from about 57 to 60 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the saline Bohicket soils on nearby salt marshes; the organic Lanexa and clayey Levy soils on nearby freshwater marshes; and nontidal Bibb, Mattan, and Nawney soils on adjacent flood plains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained; very slow runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Wetland wildlife habitat. Vegetation includes northern wild rice, arrow arum, pickerel weed, water hemp, beggar tick, cattail, spike rush, marsh habiscus, and ironweed.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Virginia. The series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Charles City County, Virginia, 1993. Lawnes is named for a Creek in Surry County.

REMARKS: Lawnes soils were included with Lanexa series and fresh water and salt water tidal marshes in the past.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
1) Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 13 inches.
2) Electrical conductivity less than 8 dS/m in more than half the upper 1 meter of soil.
3) Less than 80 cmol of soluble Ca, Mg, K, and Na per liter of saturation extract in more than half the upper 1 meter of soil.
4) Less than 0.75 percent sulfur in the upper 20 inches of the soil.
The diagnostic features recognized may be submitted for a proposed Fluvic Sulfaquent subgroup. Typic subgroup requires sulfur to be greater than 0.75 percent. Diagnostic features will be recognized as series criteria.
