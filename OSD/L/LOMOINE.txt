LOMOINE SERIES

The Lomoine series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rock or welded rhyolitic tuff. Lomoine soils are on mountains, hills, and rock pediments. Slopes are 8 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Lithic Xeric Torriorthents 

TYPICAL PEDON: Lomoine very gravelly sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface has 45 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 3 percent stones. 

 A--0 to 10 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 45 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (3 to 23 cm thick) 

 C--10 to 20 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 45 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt irregular boundary. (0 to 23 cm thick) 

 R--20 cm; fractured granite; few clay coats on top of contact and in fractures; few fine and very fine roots in fractures; becomes extremely hard at 43 cm. 

TYPE LOCATION: Esmeralda County, Nevada; about 3.5 miles southeast of Lone Mountain and 500 feet east of the road on a mountain slope; in the northeast quarter of section 35, T. 2 N., R. 40 E.; USGS Paymaster Canyon 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 37 degrees 59 minutes 28.3 seconds N and longitude 117 degrees 26 minutes 48.6 seconds W; NAD 83; UTM 11, 460764e, 4204932n, WGS84 Decimal Degrees 37.9911944 latitude, -117.446833  longitude. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: Moist in winter and spring, dry in summer and fall except for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October due to convection storms; aridic (torric) soil moisture regime that borders on xeric. 
Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 14 degrees C. 
Depth to bedrock: 10 to 36 cm to a lithic contact. 
Effervescence: Very slightly effervescence to strongly effervescent. 
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 5 percent. 
Reaction: Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. 

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 8 to 15 percent.
Rock fragments: 35 to 60 percent with a high percentage of fine gravel (2 to 5 mm in diameter). Lithology of fragments are granitic rocks such as granite or volcanic rock such as welded rhyolitic tuff. 

A horizon 
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist. 

C horizon 
Value: 5 through 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 2 through 4, dry or moist.
Texture: Very gravelly coarse sandy loam or very gravelly sandy loam.
Rock fragments: 35 to 60 percent, mainly 5 to 13 mm gravel.
Structure: Massive or subangular blocky.
Other features: Some pedons have thin weakly developed carbonate coats on gravel. 

COMPETING SERIES: These are Izar, Wala, and Wesfil series. 

Izar soils average 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Wala soils are dominated by channers and have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 11 degrees C. Wesfil soils are dominated by channers and are not moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative during summer months. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lomoine soils are on mountains, hills, and rock pediments. They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from slightly metamorphosed granitic rocks or welded rhyolitic tuff. Slopes are 8 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 1,400 to 2,290 meters. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 130 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Pumel soils. Pumel soils have a typic aridic soil moisture regime. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium to very high surface runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Lomoine soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly black sagebrush, Nevada ephedra, littleleaf horsebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, galleta, Indian ricegrass, spiny menodora, and desert needlegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Nevada. These soils are moderately extensive. The series concept and main acreage is in MLRA 29, while other acreage occurs in MLRAs 27 and 28B.
