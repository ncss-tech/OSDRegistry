LOFTON SERIES

The Lofton series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey lacustrine deposits from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. These nearly level soils are on playa steps or shallow depressions. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 483 mm (19 in), and mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, thermic Vertic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Lofton clay loam, on north-facing, nearly level, 0.5 percent slope within playa basin in cropland at an elevation of about 1,032 m (3,385 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: A typic-ustic moisture regime. The soil moisture control section is dry in some or all parts more than 90 but less than 180 cumulative days in normal years. July through August and November through March are the driest months. These soils are intermittently moist in September through October and April through June. The soil receives runoff from surrounding soils and the soil moisture control section is moist for longer periods than that of the surrounding soils. 
Mean annual soil temperature: 15 to 18 degrees C (59 to 64 degrees F). 
Depth to argillic horizon: 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in). 
Depth to secondary calcium carbonate: 50 to 100 cm (20 to 40 in). 
Depth to calcic horizon: 100 to 150 cm (40 to 60 in). 
Vertic properties: COLE is more than 0.06 within 100 cm (40 in) of the soil surface. 
Solum thickness: more than 203 cm (80 in). 
Particle-size control section: 35 to 50 percent silicate clay.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Culp series in the same family. Similar soils include Lazbuddie, Lockney, McLean, Olton, Pantex, Pullman, and Westill series. 
Culp soils: are moist in the soil moisture control section for longer periods and have mean annual soil temperatures of more than 20 degrees C (68 degrees F).

Lockney and McLean soils: do not have an argillic horizon. 
Olton, Pantex, and Pullman soils: have hues of 7.5YR or redder in matrix. 
Westill soils: have an active cation-exchange activity class. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: clayey lacustrine deposits from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. 
Landform: nearly level playa steps or shallow depressions. 
Slopes: 0 to 1 percent. 
Mean annual air temperature: 14 to 17 degrees C (57 to 62 degrees F). 
Mean annual precipitation: 432 to 533 mm (17 to 21 in). 
Frost-free period: 185 to 220 days. 
Elevation: 884 to 1,402 m (2,900 to 4,600 ft). 
Thornthwaite annual P-E Index Values: 25 to 36. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the similar Lazbuddie, Lockney, and McLean, Olton, Pantex, and Pullman series and the Portales, Randall, and Zita series. 
Lazbuddie and Lockney soils: are on similar landscape positions, do not have an argillic horizon, and have 50 to 60 percent clay in the particle-size control section. 
McLean and Randall soils: are on slightly lower landscape positions and have 50 to 60 percent clay in the particle-size control section. 
Olton, Pantex, and Pullman soils: are on slightly higher landscape positions on surrounding nearly level plains. 
Portales and Zita soils: have a cambic horizon and have less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained and very slow permeability. 
Surface runoff is low on less than one percent slopes. These soils are occasionally ponded for very brief periods. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly cultivated to cotton, grain sorghum, corn, and winter wheat. Native vegetation varies according to amount of water available. It includes western wheatgrass, vine-mesquite, buffalograss, blue grama, knotgrass, and bur ragweed. Sedges, spike rushes, and curly dock occur in wetter areas. 
This soil has been correlated to the Deep Hardland 16-21"PZ (R077CY022TX) ecological site in MLRA-77C. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern High Plains, Southern Part (MLRA 77C in LRR H) of western Texas and eastern New Mexico. The series is moderately extensive.
