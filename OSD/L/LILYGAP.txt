COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family at this time. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Lilygap soils are typically on lower portions of mountainflanks of lahars. Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. These soils formed in ashy colluvium over weathered colluvium and residuum from andesitic tuff breccia. Elevation is 900 to 1425 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 1000 to 1300 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 11 to 14 degrees C. The frost free season is 185 to 210 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Devilsnose, Iron Mountain, Mantree, McCarthy and Redapple soils. Iron Mountain soils are shallow and occur on mountaintops and steep mountainflanks. Devilsnose and McCarthy (moderately deep) soils are medial over loamy and medial-skeletal, respectively, and occur on the middle to upper thirds of mountainflanks. Mantree soils are fine-loamy, occur on mountaintops and mountainflanks below lahars and formed in residuum from intrusive igneous rock. Redapple soils are fine and occur on stable summits and backslopes of lahars.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low (lower part) to high (upper part) in the strongly-contrasting particle size control section and low to moderately low above the bedrock contact.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for timber production, watershed, recreation, and wildlife habitat. Vegetation is Douglas-fir, white fir, sugar pine, ponderosa pine, incense cedar, California black oak, with an understory of deerbrush, Pacific dogwood, snowberry, Sierra gooseberry, false lily of the valley, and broadleaf starflower.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. The series is not extensive.
