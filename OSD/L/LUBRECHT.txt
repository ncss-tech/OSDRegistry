LUBRECHT SERIES

The Lubrecht series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or residuum derived mainly from semiconsolidated Tertiary Age siltstone or shale.  These soils are on stream terraces and hills in mountain valleys.  Slopes are 4 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lubrecht silt loam, in coniferous forest (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; undecomposed and slightly decomposed forest litter.

    E--2 to 6 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak very fine platy structure parting to moderate very fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine pores; 5 percent pebbles; strongly acid (pH 5.5); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick)

    E/Bt--6 to 10 inches; E part (75 percent) is light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist which interfingers into the B part; B part (25 percent) is brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; texture mixed is silt loam; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear smooth boundary.

    Bt1--13 to 21 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; strong medium and coarse blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; common very fine pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; common very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) organic stains; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary.

    Bt2--21 to 32 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots and few medium and coarse roots; common very fine pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt1 and Bt2 horizons is 8 to 22 inches.)

    Bt3--32 to 38 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly silty clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent pebbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary.  (7 to 12 inches thick)

    Cr--38 to 60 inches; semiconsolidated siltstone.
