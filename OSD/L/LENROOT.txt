LENROOT SERIES

The Lenroot series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, rapidly permeable soils formed in sandy outwash on outwash plains and stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Mixed, frigid Oxyaquic Udipsamments

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lenroot loamy sand on a 2 percent convex northeast-facing slope in a forested area. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A--0 to 4 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) loamy sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; very friable; about 6 percent gravel; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (4 to 9 inches thick)

     Bw1--4 to 8 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/3) loamy sand; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; about 10 percent gravel; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.

     Bw2--8 to 14 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) loamy coarse sand; single grain; loose; about 8 percent gravel; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bw horizons is 8 to 32 inches.)

     BC--14 to 21 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) gravelly coarse sand; single grain; loose; about 16 percent gravel; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick)

     C1--21 to 29 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) coarse sand; single grain; loose; few medium distinct yellowish red (5YR 4/6) masses of iron accumulations; about 14 percent gravel; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

     C2--29 to 36 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) very gravelly coarse sand; single grain; loose; common medium distinct yellowish red (5YR 4/6) masses of iron accumulations; about 37 percent gravel; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.

     C3--36 to 43 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) coarse sand; single grain; loose; common medium and coarse distinct yellowish red (5YR 4/6) masses of iron accumulations; about 10 percent gravel; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.

     C4--43 to 54 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) gravelly coarse sand; single grain; loose; few coarse distinct yellowish red (5YR 4/6) masses of iron accumulations; about 30 percent gravel; neutral; clear wavy boundary.

     C5--54 to 80 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) gravelly coarse sand; single grain; loose; about 32 percent gravel; neutral.

TYPE LOCATION:  Sawyer County, Wisconsin; about 3/4 mile northeast of Hayward; 950 feet south and 825 feet east of the northwest corner of sec. 23, T. 41 N., R. 9 W; USGS Hayward topographic quadrangle; lat. 46 Degrees 1 minute 27 seconds N. and long. 91 Degrees 27 minutes 52 seconds W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:   Volume of gravel in the control section averages between 15 and 35 percent but subhorizons in some pedons have less than 15 percent or more than 35 percent. Gravel is mostly of igneous origin and commonly 0.2 to 5 cm in diameter.

 The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is loamy sand. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.

Some pedons have a thin E horizon.

The Bw horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, coarse sand, sand, or their gravelly analogues.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid. 

The BC horizon has hue of 5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is coarse sand, sand, or their gravelly analogues. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.

The C horizon has hue of 5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is gravelly coarse sand or gravelly sand but some subhorizons are sand, coarse sand, or the very gravelly or extremely gravelly analogs.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are Crex, Mooers, Pelkie, Seulchoix(T), Sissabagama, Sunia, Tourtillotte, Westoo(T) and Wurtsmith series.  The Crex, Mooers, Pelkie, Sissabagama, Sunia, Tourtillotte, Westoo and Wurtsmith soils average less than 15 percent rock fragments by volume in the particle size control section. The Seulchoix soils have carbonates in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils have plane or convex slopes on outwash plains and stream terraces. Slope gradients range from 0 to 4 percent. These soils formed in sandy glacial outwash of Late Wisconsinan Age. Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 26 to 33 inches. Frost-free days range from 90 to 135. Elevation above sea level ranges from 600 to 1600 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Lenroot soils are in association with Mahtomedi soils. Mahtomedi soils are excessively drained and do not have redox features above 40 inches. In some areas they are associated with Wurtsmith soils which average less than 15 percent rock fragments in the series control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained. Surface runoff is slow.  Permeability is rapid. Depth to an apparent high water table is 2.0 to 3.5 feet from April to June in most years.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are pastureland or forested with mixed stands of jack pine and pin oak being most common with aspen and red pine occasionally present.Some areas are cultivated.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern and Northcentral Wisconsin. This series is of small extent.  MLRA  91.

SERIES PROPOSED:  Sawyer County, Wisconsin, 2000.  Source of the name is a township in Northwestern Sawyer County.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features identified in this soil are: 
ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 4 inches (A horizon); 
Oxyaquic feature - redoximorphic features and saturation within 40 inches for 1 month or longer in 6 out of 10 years (C horizons); 
udic moisture regime.

This soil was formerly correlated as Mahtomedi, moderately wet phase.
