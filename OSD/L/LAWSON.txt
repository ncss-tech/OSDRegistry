LAWSON SERIES

The Lawson series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in silty alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains and upland drainageways.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 920 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquic Cumulic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Lawson silt loam, on a 1 percent slope, in an uncultivated field, at an elevation of about 265 meters above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 A1--0 to 30 centimeters; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium and fine granular; friable; many roots; neutral; clear wavy boundary.

 A2--30 to 48 centimeters; black (10YR 2/1) and very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium and fine granular; friable; many roots; neutral; clear wavy boundary.

 A3--48 to 76 centimeters; black (10YR 2/1) and very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; friable; neutral; clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizon is 60 to 90 centimeters.)

 C1--76 to 102 centimeters; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) and black (10YR 2/1) silty clay loam stratified with thin lenses of silt loam and loam; moderate medium angular and subangular blocky structure; firm; neutral; clear wavy boundary. (0 to 39 centimeters thick)

 C2--102 to 152 centimeters; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam interlayered with thin lenses of loam and sandy loam; massive with a few thin, coarse-textured strata; friable; common fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation in the matrix; neutral.

TYPE LOCATION: Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) 105-Northern Mississippi Valley Loess Hills, Iowa County, Wisconsin subset; about 4 miles south-southeast of Mineral Point; located about 1,000 feet east and 2,400 feet south of the northwest corner of section 17, T. 4 N., R. 3 E.; USGS Mineral Point topographic quadrangle; lat. 42 degrees 49 minutes 21 seconds N. and 90 degrees 10 minutes 06 seconds W., NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Thickness of the mollic epipedon--60 to 90 centimeters
Clay content in the particle-size control section (weighted average)--18 to 30 percent
Sand content in the particle-size control section (weighted average)--5 to 20 percent

Ap or A horizon:
Hue--10YR
Value--2 or 3
Chroma--1 or 2
Texture--silt loam or silty clay loam
Clay content--10 to 35 percent
Sand content--5 to 20 percent
Rock fragment content--0 percent
Reaction--slightly acid to slightly alkaline

C horizon:
Hue--10YR or 2.5Y
Value--3 to 6
Chroma--1 to 3
Texture--silt loam or silty clay loam, or stratified with silt loam, silty clay loam, loam, and sandy loam, thin strata of coarser texture are common
Clay content--10 to 30 percent
Sand content--5 to 60 percent
Rock fragment content--0 percent
Reaction--slightly acid to slightly alkaline

Distinct or prominent redoximorphic features generally are in the horizons below the mollic epipedon

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ely, Littleton and Smithland series.
Ely--have a clay content that averages 27 to 35 percent and have a cambic horizon
Littleton--have a cambic horizon
Smithland--have a mollic epipedon more than 90 centimeters thick and have a cambic horizon

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--silty alluvium
Landform--flood plains and upland drainageways
Slope--0 to 5 percent
Elevation--100 to 470 meters above sea level
Mean annual air temperature--4 to 14 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation--700 to 1,140 millimeters
Frost-free period--125 to 210 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Boaz, Chaseburg, Huntsville, and Orion soils.
Boaz--are on landscape positions similar to those of the Lawson soils, have an ochric epipedon a cambic horizon
Chaseburg--are at higher landscape positions and do not have a frequently saturated zone within a depth of 1.8 meters for during the wettest periods of normal years
Huntsville--are at slightly higher landscape positions on flood plains and have a frequently saturated zone at a depth of 1.2 meters during the wettest periods of normal years
Orion--are on landscape positions similar to those of the Lawson soils, have a buried horizon and have an average clay content of 10 to 18 percent in the particle-size control section

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--somewhat poorly drained--a frequently saturated zone occurs within depths of 0.3 to 0.9 meter during the wettest periods of normal years and is considered apparent
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--1.00 to 10.00 micrometers per second (moderately high)
Surface runoff potential--negligible to low
Flooding--rarely to frequently flooded for very brief to long duration

USE AND VEGETATION:
Many areas are used for forage production. Cultivated areas produce good crop yields where excess water is not a problem. Native vegetation consists of scattered silver maple, white ash, American elm trees, tall prairie grasses, and forbs.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Lafayette County, Wisconsin, 1964.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 76 centimeters (A1, A2, and A3 horizons);
cumulic property--mollic epipedon more than 60 centimeters thick and, greater than 0.3 percent organic carbon at a depth of 125 centimeters and/or an irregular decrease of organic carbon with increasing depth from 25 to 125 centimeters;
udic moisture regime;
mesic temperature regime.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
