LONGWAY SERIES

The Longway series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed alluvium from rhyolitic tuff, rhyolite and quartzite.  Longway soils are on fan remnants and stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 580 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3.3 degrees C.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Pachic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Longway silt loam on a stream terrace with 2 percent slope at an elevation of 1,987 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(0 to 36 cm thick)  

   2C--107 to 157 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 30 percent rounded gravel; neutral (pH 6.8).
