LAGARITA SERIES

The Lagarita series consist of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium and slope alluvium derived from andesite, rhyolite, breccia, or tuff.  These soils are on alluvial fans and mountain footslopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Lagarita gravelly loam, on a southwest facing 15 percent mountain footslope on rangeland at an elevation of 9,840 feet.  (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

TYPE LOCATION: Saguache County, Colorado; about 13 miles south of Parlin, Colorado; located about 950 feet west and 2,700 feet north of the southeast corner of Section 26, T. 47 N., R. 2 E.; USGS Razor Creek Dome topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees, 18 minutes, 13 seconds north and longitude 106 degrees, 43 minutes, 34 seconds west, NAD 1927.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section (smcs) is affected by precipitation that falls evenly throughout the year with the exception of a significant increase in July and August.  The smcs is driest during the fall.  The smcs is too dry for Udic and is considered to have an Ustic bordering on Aridic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 38 to 42 degrees F.
Particle-size control section: 18 to 34 percent clay, 35 to 70 percent rock fragments
Thickness of mollic epipedon: 7 to 15 inches
Depth to top of argillic horizon: 7 to 15 inches
Depth to top of calcic horizon; 15 to 20 inches

A horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3 dry or moist

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Blaine, Bowen, Fornor, Fourmile, Geertsen, Hodden, Hoodle, Libeg, Maciver, Nathale, Norriston, Parkview, Quander, Ratiopeak, Teeler, and Woodhall series.
Blaine, Bowen, Nathale, Woodhall: lithic contact between 20 and 40 inches
Fornor, Fourmile, Libeg, Norriston, Parkview, Quander, Ratiopeak: do not have calcic horizons
Geertsen: lithic contact below 40 inches
Hodden: formed from mixed sources and are drier during the winter
Hoodle: thicker argillic horizon and has weakly cemented fragments of a carbonate pan
Maciver: rock fragments are calcareous argillite
Teeler: have hue redder than 7.5YR and are more moist in the spring

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: alluvium and slope alluvium from andesite, rhyolite, breccia, or tuff
Landform: alluvial fans and mountain footslopes
Slopes: 2 to 40 percent
Elevation: 9,000 to 10,100 feet
Mean annual temperature: 36 to 40 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 14 to 18 inches
Frost-free period: 55 to 65 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Monchego and Quander soils. Monchego soils are on outwash fans and outwash terraces and have a strongly contrasting particle-size class. Quander soils are on the lower parts of alluvial fans and mountain footslopes and lack a calcic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: well drained; medium to very high runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for rangeland. Potential native vegetation is Arizona fescue, mountain muhly, Indian ricegrass, and muttongrass. It is in the Mountain Outwash Range Site, RS 311.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Colorado in LRR E and MLRA 48B. The series is of small extent.
