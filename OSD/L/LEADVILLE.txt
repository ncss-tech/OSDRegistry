LEADVILLE SERIES

The Leadville series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in thick colluvium, alluvium, or glacial debris derived from gneiss, schist, and sedimentary rocks.  Leadville soils are on mountain slopes, alluvial fans, and terraces. Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 36 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Glossocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Leadville stony loam - forest.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    0i--0 to 3 inches; slightly decomposed needles, bark, twigs, and grass remains.  (1 to 2 inches thick)

    0e--3 to 4 inches; partially decomposed organic material derived from the materials overlying this horizon.  (Combined thickness of the Oi and Oe horizons is 2 to 4 inches)

    A--4 to 5 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; strong fine granular and crumb structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 10 percent stones; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 4 inches thick)

    E--5 to 12 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/3) loam, brown (7.5YR 5/3) moist; moderate thin platy structure parting to medium granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 10 percent stones; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 14 inches thick)

    B/E--12 to 18 inches; mixed reddish brown (5YR 5/4) and pink (7.5YR 7/3) very stony clay loam (composite texture), reddish brown (5YR 4/4) and brown (7.5YR 5/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few glossy patches on some peds, and in some root channels and pores;  the horizon consists of clayey material like that of the underlying horizon embedded in a matrix like that of the overlying horizon; 40 percent stones; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 12 inches thick)

    Bt1--18 to 34 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) extremely stony clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, very firm, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common continuous clay films on faces of peds and as coatings in root channels and pores; 70 percent stones; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 25 inches thick)

    Bt2--34 to 44 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) extremely stony clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; glossy patches on some peds and in some root channels and pores; 60 percent stones; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 12 inches thick)

    C--44 to 64 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) extremely stony loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; massive; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 70 percent stones; neutral.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lake County, Colorado; about 1 mile south of Leadville, 1.2 miles east of Highway 24 along county road #6 in the SW 1/4 Sec. 25, T. 9 S., R. 80 W. Leadville South USGS quad; approximate lat. 39 degrees 13 minutes 58 seconds N. and long. 106 degrees 17 minutes 19 seconds W., NAD 83

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Depths are from the mineral surface.
Moisture regime: udic bordering on ustic.
Mean annual soil temperature: 38 to 44 degrees F.
The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 51 to 56 degrees F.
Depth to the top of the argillic horizon: 10 to 24 inches
Rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent in the 10- to 40-inch section and are mainly 3 to 48 inches in diameter. 

A horizon: (if present)
Hue:  10YR to 5YR
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma:  1 to 3.

E horizon: 
Hue:  10YR to 5YR
Value:  5 to 8 dry, 4 to 7 moist
Chroma:  1 to 4

Bt horizon: 
Hue:  5YR to 10R
Value:  5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma:  1 to 6
Texture of the fine earth fraction: loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam 
Clay content: 18 to 35 percent 
Rock fragment content: 35 to 80 percent
Reaction: strongly acid to neutral

C horizon: (when present)
Hue:  5YR to 10R
Texture of the fine earth fraction: loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.
Reaction: strongly acid to neutral

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Gambler, Granile, Kebler, Kurrie, Larand, MacFarlane, and Tuckerville series.
Gambler soils: have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.
Kebler soils: have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.
Granile soils: have hues of 7.5YR or yellower in the Bt horizon.
Kurrie soils: have a lithic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches.
Larand soils: have a sandy-skeletal substratum.
MacFarlane soils have hue yellower than 5YR in the Bt horizon and less than 18 percent clay in the fine-earth fraction on the Bt.
Tuckerville soils: are close competitors, but are believed to be more moist in the moisture control section and possibly warmer; Tuckerville soils support white fir in the plant community.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: colluvium, alluvium, and glacial debris from gneiss, schist, and sedimentary rocks.
Landform: mountain sides, alluvial fans, and terraces.  
Slopes:  2 to 50 or more percent. 
Mean annual precipitation is 18 to 26 inches.
    Wettest periods:  in the spring and summer.  
    Mean annual temperature:  36 to 42 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Troutville soils and the competing Kebler soils.  Troutville soils lack a continuous argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to high runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used as native pastureland, for forestry, and for recreation.  Typical native vegetation is lodgepole pine, Engelmann's spruce, and subalpine fir.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central and southern Colorado; LRR E, MLRA 48A. Moderately extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lake County, Colorado, 1974.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: the zone from 12 to 32 inches. (B/E and part of the Bt1 horizons)
Albic horizon: the zone from 5 to 12 inches (E horizon).
Glossic horizon: the zone from 12 to 18 inches. (B/E horizon).
Argillic horizon: the zone from 12 to 44 inches. (B/E and part of Bt1 horizons).

4/2001 the precipitation range was narrowed to less than 26 inches to limit this series to ustic-udic moisture regime.
