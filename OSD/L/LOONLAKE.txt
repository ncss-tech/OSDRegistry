LOONLAKE SERIES 

The Loonlake series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash over glacial outwash.  These soils are on stream terraces and outwash plains in valleys.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Andic Paleudalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Loonlake gravelly ashy silt loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; undecomposed and slightly decomposed forest litter. (1 to 2 inches thick)

    Bw--2 to 11 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly ashy silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium and few coarse roots; 15 percent gravel; moderately acid (ph 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (7 to 10 inches thick) 

    2E--11 to 26 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and medium and few coarse roots; 10 percent cobbles, 35 percent gravel; moderately acid (ph 6.0); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick) 

    2E/Bt--26 to 38 inches; E part (80 percent) is very pale brown (10YR 7/3) extremely cobbly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist, Bt part (20 percent) is pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely cobbly sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium and few coarse roots; 30 percent cobbles, 40 percent gravel; moderately acid (ph 6.0); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 15 inches thick) 

    2Bt--38 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common medium and few coarse roots; continuous faint clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent cobbles, 40 percent gravel; slightly acid (ph 6.4).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Loonlake soils are used mainly for woodland, understory grazing, and wildlife habitat.  Potential native vegetation is mainly ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, western larch, lodgepole pine, grand fir, and Engelmann spruce.  Understory vegetation is mainly pinegrass, russet buffaloberry, forbs, and shrubs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Loonlake soils are of small extent in the valleys of northwestern Montana.  MLRA 44A.
