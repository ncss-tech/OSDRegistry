LEDEIR SERIES

The Ledeir series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash over alluvium on old, stable terraces. Slopes are 0 to 10 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1,700 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, amorphic over isotic, frigid Andic Haplorthods

TYPICAL PEDON: Ledeir ashy sandy loam, on a terrace landform with a SW facing slope of 2 percent at 747 meters elevation under coniferous forest vegetation. When described on October 12, 2006 the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.) 

 Oi--0 to 2 cm; slightly decomposed plant material; few very fine and fine roots throughout; abrupt smooth boundary.

 Oe--2 to 12 cm; moderately decomposed plant material; few very fine and fine roots and common medium and coarse roots throughout; abrupt wavy boundary.

 E--12 to 20 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) ashy sandy loam, light gray (10YR 7/1) dry; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots throughout; 5 percent fine gravel; very strongly acid (pH 4.6); clear irregular boundary.

 Bs1--20 to 50 cm; strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) ashy sandy loam, reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine, fine, medium, coarse, and very coarse roots throughout; 5 percent fine gravel and 5 percent medium and coarse gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.4); clear wavy boundary.

 Bs2--50 to 82 cm; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) ashy fine sandy loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots throughout; 5 percent fine gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.5); clear wavy boundary.

 2C--82 to 152 cm; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) very gravelly loamy sand, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) dry; single grain; loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine roots throughout; 20 percent fine gravel and 15 percent medium and coarse gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this family.  The Easy and Nargar series are in similar families.  Easy soils are ashy over loamy-skeletal.  Nargar soils have a mesic temperature regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Ledeir soils are on old, stable terraces at elevations of 500 to 1000 meters. Slopes are 0 to 10 percent. These soils formed in volcanic ash over alluvium. The climate consists of cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1,700 to 2,500 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 5 to 10 degrees C. Frost-free season is 60 to 90 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Tricouni (T) series.  Tricouni soils form on old, stable terraces, but lack spodic and albic materials.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for watershed, recreation, woodland, and wildlife habitat. Potential natural vegetation consists of western hemlock, Douglas-fir, and western red cedar with an understory of red huckleberry, Alaska huckleberry, Cascade Oregongrape, prince's pine, and rattlesnake plantain.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western slopes of the North Cascade Mountains, Washington. MLRA 3. Series is of moderate extent.
