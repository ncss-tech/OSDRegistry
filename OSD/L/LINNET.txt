LINNET SERIES

The Linnet series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in clayey alluvium and glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on lake plains, stream terraces, alluvial fans, drainageways, and till plains.  Slopes are 0 to 10 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 120 days.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Torrertic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Linnet silty clay loam, cropland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 6 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; strong fine and very fine granular structure; very hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine pores; common unstained sand grains; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt wavy boundary.

    BCy--42 to 66 inches; grayish brown and light brownish gray (2.5Y 5/2 and 6/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak thick and very thick platy structure parting to weak fine and medium blocky; extremely hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine pores; few fine lignite chips; 5 percent pebbles; slightly effervescent; common fine nests and seams of gypsum; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Cascade County, Montana, 1969.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT0110, MT0843.  Linnet soils were formerly classified as Brown soils.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 15 inches (Ap, Bt horizons); and argillic horizon from 6 to 30 inches that is also the particle-size control section (Bt, Btk horizons); accumulations of calcium carbonates from 15 to 42 inches (Btk, Bk horizons).  Linnet soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.
