LOVINGTON SERIES

The Lovington series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils. These soils formed in calcareous, loamy lacustrine deposits of Quaternary age. Lovington soils are on nearly level playa steps and interdunes. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 406 mm (16 in), and mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C. (61 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Aridic Calciustolls

(Combined thickness of the Bk horizons is 51 to 110 cm [20 to 43 in].)

 Bkk--101 to 203 cm (40 to 60 in); white (10YR 8/1) loam, light gray (10YR 7/1) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots throughout; about 60 percent calcium carbonate by volume as masses, nodules, and finely disseminated carbonates; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.

Ratliff,Tornero, andVestwellssoils: are on higher landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:Well drained and moderate permeability. Runoff is negligible on less than 1 percent slope.

USE AND VEGETATION:These soils are used primarily for rangeland. Native vegetation is mainly mid and short grasses and includes blue grama, black grama, sideoats grama, and buffalograss, with lesser amounts of galleta or tobosa, silver bluestem, threeawn. Woody plants include cholla and yucca. This soil has been correlated to the High Lime (R077DY040TX) range site in MLRA-77D.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:Southern High Plains, Southern Part (MLRA 77D in LRR H); of eastern New Mexico. The soil is minor in extent.
