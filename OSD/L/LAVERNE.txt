LAVERNE SERIES

The Laverne series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in arenaceous limestone (caliche) from the Ash Hollow or Kimball Members, Ogallala Formation of Miocene-Pliocene age. These very gently to strongly sloping soils occur on hillslopes, structural benches, and mesa or butte summits.  The slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 533 mm (21 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Lithic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Laverne loam - on a 2 percent slope in native rangeland at an elevation of 808 m (2651 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)  The surface is covered with about 7 percent gravels of strongly cemented caliche.

REMARKS: 
Laverne series was formerly included in the Potter series.

Edited 08-2020 (SLM and RFG):  Changed the series concept from a petrocalcic horizon limiting layer to arenaceous limestone bedrock.  Also changed to tabular format, added metric measurements, updated completing series, geographic setting, and associated soils sections.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
  Mollic epipedon: 0 to 32 cm (0 to 12.6 in) (Ak and BCk horizons)
  Secondary carbonates: 0 to 32 cm 0 to 12.6 in) (Ak and BCk horizons)
