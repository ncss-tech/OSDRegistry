LESIER SERIES 

The Lesier series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that have a high component of volcanic ash in the surface layers and formed in mixed alluvium, outwash or till.  These soils are on stream terraces, outwash terraces or moraines.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Vitrandic Eutrudepts 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lesier gravelly ashy silt loam, forested (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 1 inch; undecomposed and slightly decomposed forest litter. 

    A--1 to 2 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) gravelly ashy silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many fine and medium and few coarse roots; volcanic ash component; 20 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick) 

    Bw--2 to 11 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly ashy silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many fine and medium and few coarse roots; 20 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (8 to 11 inches thick) 

    2E--11 to 18 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly sandy loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and medium and few coarse roots; 10 percent cobbles, 30 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 12 inches thick) 

    2Bk1--18 to 35 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly sandy loam, very pale brown (10YR 8/3) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; nonsticky and nonplastic; common medium and coarse roots; 20 percent cobbles, 40 percent gravel; disseminated lime; common distinct lime coatings on undersides of rock fragments; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 17 inches thick) 

    2Bk2--35 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely cobbly sandy loam, very pale brown (10YR 8/3) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few medium and coarse roots; 30 percent cobbles, 45 percent gravel; disseminated lime; many distinct lime coatings on undersides of rock fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).
