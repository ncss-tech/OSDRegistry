LAVENTANA SERIES

The Laventana series consists of deep and very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soil formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from andesite or granite.  Laventana soils are on mountain slopes and pediments. Slopes range from 3 to 55 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Laventana very cobbly loam--woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--1/2 inch to 0; forest litter.  (0 to 2 inches thick).

    A--0 to 4 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) very cobbly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate thin platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 30 percent cobbles, 15 percent pebbles; 2 percent stones; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 9 inches thick)

    E--4 to 11 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; common very fine and a few fine tubular pores; 5 percent cobbles and 20 percent pebbles; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. (2 to 12 inches thick)

    Bt1--11 to 19 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure parting to strong fine angular blocky; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; common thin clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 25 percent cobbles, 15 percent pebbles; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary. (3 to 21 inches thick)

    Bt2--19 to 30 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10Y  4/3) moist; strong very fine and medium angular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; common thin clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 10 percent cobbles and 40 percent pebbles; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (6 to 16 inches thick)

    Bt3--30 to 50 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common moderately thick clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 10 percent cobbles and 40 percent pebbles; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 31 inches thick)

    2R--50 inches; fractured andesite.

TYPE LOCATION:  Sandoval County, New Mexico; about 8 miles northeast of the Zia Pueblo; NW 4, NW 4 of Sec. 24, T. 17 N., R. 3 E.  State plane coordinates are N. 1,708,350 and E. 400,523 feet; 106 degrees, 35 minutes, 14 seconds west longitude; 35 degrees, 41 minutes, 13 seconds north latitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture:  The soil moisture control section is moist in all parts during the 120 days following the winter solstice and is dry in all parts periodically  during late May and June. It is moist in all parts more than 40 percent of the time that the soil temperature is greater than 41 degrees F.

Soil temperature:  45 to 47 degrees F.

Depth to the base of the Bt horizons:  40 inches or more.

Depth to bedrock:  greater than 40 inches.

Particle-size control section - rock fragments, by volume:  Weighted average is 35 to 75 percent rock fragments. Clay content: 20 to 35 percent.

Fine-earth fraction:  More than 35 percent sand

A horizon - Value:  3 through 6 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.  When mixed to 7 inches the values ar 5 or less dry.  Texture:  cobbly fine sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, cobbly loam, very cobbly loam or very gravelly loam.

E horizon - Value:  5 through 7 dry.
Chroma: 2 or 3.
Texture:  cobbly fine sandy loam, very gravelly loam or gravelly silt loam.

Bt horizons - Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR.
Value:  5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  3 through 6. Reaction:  slightly acid to neutral.
Texture (<2mm fraction):  loam or sandy clay loam.
Rock Fragments:  35 to 75 percent.
Reaction: slightly acid to neutral.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Colomex, Crackercreek, Olot, Sawbuck (T), Security and Sheek (T) series.  Colomex soils lack albic horizons.  Crackercreek soils have volcanic ash influenced surface layers 14 to 20 inches thick.  Olot and Security soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  Sawbuck soils lack E horizons and have less than 35 percent sand.  Sheek soils have E horizons that lack the characteristics of an albic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Laventana soils formed in alluvium and colluvium and are on mountain slopes and pediments.  Slope ranges from 3 to 55 percent.  Elevations range from 6,900 to 9,100 feet.  Mean annual precipitation is 16 to 23 inches.  The frost-free period is 80 to 115 days.  Mean annual air temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Mirand soils.  Mirand soils are fine textured.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Use is for livestock grazing, timber production and wildlife habitat.  Present vegetation is ponderosa pine, Gambel oak, mountain muhly, Arizona fescue and mutton grass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northcentral New Mexico.  Laventana soils are of small exent.
