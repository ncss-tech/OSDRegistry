LITTLERIVER SERIES

The Littleriver series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in fluviomarine deposits. Littleriver soils are on marine terrace remnants on hillslopes and lower mountain slopes and have slopes of 9 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1650 millimeters (65 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (53 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Littleriver and Sasquatch series. The Littleriver and Sasquatch soils have subangular fragments throughout.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Littleriver soils are on marine terrace remnants on hillslopes and lower mountain slopes. Slope gradients are 5 to 50 percent. Elevations are 10 to 125 meters (33 to 410 feet). These soils formed in fluvialmarine deposits. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, rainy winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1550 to 1750 millimeters (61 to 69 inches). Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free season is about 260 to 325 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Sasquatch and Sisterrocks soils.  Sasquatch and Sisterrocks soils have subangular fragments throughout.  Sasquatch and Sisterrocks soils are generally found above Littleriver soils on strongly convex slopes over consolidated sandstone and mudstone.  

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium to high runoff; Moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil has been used for commercial timber production, wildlife, and watershed. Natural vegetation includes redwood, Sitka Spruce Douglas-fir, salal, and western swordfern.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coastal Redwood Belt; MLRA 4b. The series is not extensive.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

1. Umbric epipedon - the zone from 5 to 49 centimeters (A and AB horizons).
2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 49 to 200 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, BCt horizons).
3. Palehumult feature - clay percent does not decrease with depth.
4. Particle-size control section - the zone from 49 to 99 centimeters, averages 32 percent clay, by weight, and 28 percent rock fragments, by volume.
