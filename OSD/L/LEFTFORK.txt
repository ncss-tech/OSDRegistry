LEFTFORK SERIES

The Leftfork series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from sedimentary rocks.  Leftfork soils are on mountain sideslopes and ridgetops.  Slopes are 5 to 40 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, smectitic, frigid Typic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Leftfork loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 5 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure parting to strong medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular and interstitial pores; 1 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary.

    Bt3--18 to 25 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) clay, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; strong medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular and interstitial pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 20 inches thick)

    2Bt4--25 to 43 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely stony clay, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 45 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles and 15 percent stones; strongly effervescent; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 20 inches thick)

    2Cr--43 to 45 inches;  grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) weathered limestone;  violently effervescent. (0 to 5 inches thick)

    2R--45 inches;  limestone.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Beefhollow, Booford, Harter, Manila, Marsden,  Observation, Ostler, Rob Roy, Shagnasty and Tatouche series.  Booford, Observation and Rob Roy soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Beefhollow, Harter, Manila, Ostler and Tatouche soils are greater than 60 inches to bedrock.  Marsden soils have less than 30 day frost-free period and formed in lacustrine sediments.  Shagnasty soils formed in rhyolite, andesite or quartzite. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform:  mountain sideslopes and ridgetops
Elevation:  5,800 to 7,100 feet
Slope:  5 to 40 percent
Parent material:  alluvium from sedimentary rocks
Climate:  long, cold winters; moist springs; warm, dry summers
Average annual precipitation:  12 to 20 inches
Average annual temperature:  39 to 45 degrees F.
Frost-free season:  70 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cleavage, Shalcleav and Swanpeak soils.  Cleavage and Shalcleav soils are shallow to bedrock and occur on similar landform positions.   Swanpeak soils have clayey-skeletal particle-size control sections and occur on slightly lower landscape positions and on summit flats.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very high surface runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly mountain big sage, low sage, antelope bitterbrush, service berry, buckwheat, Kentucky bluegrass and bigtop bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho.  These soils are of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Bear Lake County, Idaho, 2008.  The name is from a nearby spring and canyon. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 11 inches  (A and Bt1 horizons).

Argillic horizon - the zone from 5 to 43 inches. (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 and 2Bt4 horizons).
