LIVERMORE SERIES

The Livermore series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in very gravelly alluvium derived from sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks. Livermore soils are on low nearly level terraces and gently sloping alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 9 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature air temperature is about 60 degrees F.

TYPE LOCATION:  Alameda County, California; about 3 miles southeast of Livermore at a point 2,000 feet east and 2,600 feet north of the southwest corner of section 23, T. 3 S., R. 2 E., MDB&M. 37 degrees North latitude, 39 minutes, 25 seconds, 121 degrees West longitude, 43 minutes,33 seconds.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

The Ap and A horizons have dry colors of 10YR 5/3, 5/2, 4/3, 4/2 and moist colors or 10YR 3/3, 3/2, 2/2. Texture of surface layer ranges from very gravelly coarse sandy loam, very gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly loam, through gravelly loam. Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.

The B horizons have dry colors of 10YR 6/4, 5/4, 5/3; 7.5YR 6/4, 5/4, 4/4 and moist color of 10YR 4/6, 4/4, 4/3, 3/4, 3/3; 7.5YR 4/6, 4/4, 3/4. Texture ranges from very gravelly coarse sandy loam to very gravelly  clay loam, inclusive. Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.

The C horizon has dry colors of 10YR 6/3, 5/4 and moist colors of 10YR 4/4, 4/3, 3/4.  Texture ranges from very gravelly loamy coarse sand to very gravelly loam, inclusive.  Reactionis slightly acid to slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Livermore soils developed in very gravelly alluvium from sedimentary and metasedimentary rock.  The soils occur on low nearly level terraces and alluvial fans. Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent. Livermore soils occur at elevations of 100 to 1600 feet in a dry subhumid, mesothermal climate having a mean annual rainfall of 14 to 22 inches with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winter; an average January temperature of 48 degrees F.; an average July temperature of 71 degrees F.; a mean annual temperature of about 59 degrees F.; and frost free season is 185 to 250 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Livermore soils are geographically associated with Pleasanton, Yolo, Cortina and Positas series and they are similar to Pleasanton, Cortina, and Millrace soils.  Pleasanton soils are gravelly and have moderately fine textured B horizons. Cortina soils are very gravelly coarse textured alluvial soils, lacking B horizons.  Millrace soils, developed in very gravelly coarse textured alluvium from basalt and andesite, have coarse textured sola but are otherwise similar.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained.  Runoff is negligable to low.  Permeability is moderately rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly cultivated, primarily for vineyards and orchard; native vegetation annual grasses, forbs and scattered oak.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Interior and coastal valleys in or adjacent to the Coast Ranges in central California. The Livermore series is of moderate extent.
