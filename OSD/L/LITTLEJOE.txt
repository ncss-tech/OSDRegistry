MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Nelson County, Virginia, 1988. 

REMARKS: This soil was previously mapped as Tatum, a thermic soil. 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
1. Ochric epipedon-zone from the surface to 8 inches (A and E horizons) 
2. Argillic horizon-zone from 8 to 41 inches (Bt horizon) 
3. Paralithic contact-starting at 41 inches 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Ranges for morphology, chemistry, particle size distribution, and mineralogy are based on 3 pedons and the thermic counterpart to this soil.
