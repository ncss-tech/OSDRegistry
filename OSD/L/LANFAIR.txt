LANFAIR SERIES


The Lanfair series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from metamorphic sources. Lanfair soils are on inset fans or alluvial fans. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, thermic Ustic Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON: Lanfair extremely gravelly sandy loam, rangeland and wildlife habitat. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered by approximately 70 percent pebbles, 5 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones. 

	A--0 to 2 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak thick platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 70 percent pebbles, 5 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick) 

	Bw--2 to 9 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium and many very fine roots; few fine tubular and common very fine tubular pores; 20 percent pebbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 9 inches thick) 

	Bk--9 to 15 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, few fine and medium roots; common very fine interstitial pores; few thin calcium carbonate coats on undersides of rock fragments; 55 percent pebbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 13 inches thick) 

	2Bkq1--15 to 26 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly coarse sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; few thin calcium carbonate and silica coats on undersides of rock fragments; 45 percent pebbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 21 inches thick) 

	2Bkq2--26 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly coarse sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine interstitial pores; common thin calcium carbonate and silica coats on the underside of rock fragments; 45 percent pebbles, 5 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4). 

TYPE LOCATION: Clark County, Nevada; approximately 5 1/4 miles east of McCullough Mountain along the power transmission lines that run between the McCullough Range and Highland Range; about 1,590 feet south and 1,875 feet west of the projected northeast corner of section 7, T. 27 S., R. 62 E.; 35 degrees, 36 minutes, 42.1 seconds north latitude and 115 degrees, 05 minutes, 10.8 seconds west longitude; UTM 11, 673326e, 3942568n; NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil moisture - Usually dry, moist in some part during winter and spring and intermittingly moist in the upper part following summer convection storms. 

Soil temperature - 59 to 65 degrees F. 

Depth to base of the cambic horizon - 10 to 25 inches. 

Control section - Clay Content: Averages 4 to 10 percent. 

Rock fragments: Average 35 to 70 percent, with 1/3 or more of the rock fragments being fine gravel. 

A horizon - Value: 5 or 6 dry. 

Bw horizon - Value: 5 or 6 dry. 
Chroma: 3 or 4 dry and moist. 
Texture: Sandy loam or fine sandy loam. 
Rock fragments: 15 to 35 percent. 
Clay content: 6 to 14 percent. 
Consistence: Soft or slightly hard dry and nonsticky or slightly sticky, wet. 

Bk horizon - Value: 5 or 6 dry. 
Chroma: 3 or 4 dry and moist. 
Texture: Sandy loam or fine sandy loam. 
Clay content: 6 to 14 percent. 
Rock fragments: 35 to 60 percent, mainly gravel. 
Consistence: Nonsticky or slightly sticky, wet. 

2Bkq horizons - Hues: 10YR or 7.5YR.

Chroma: 3 or 4 dry and moist. 
Texture: Coarse sand or loamy coarse sand. 
Clay content: 2 to 8 percent. 
Rock fragments: 35 to 70 percent, mainly gravel 
Consistence: Soft or slightly hard, dry. 
Other features: Some layers contain discontinuous pockets that are slightly effervescent. 

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lanfair soils are on inset fans or alluvial fans. These soils formed in alluvium from metamorphic sources. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent. Elevations are 3,600 to 5,300 feet. The climate is hot and semi-arid with warm, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 7 to 9 inches; mean annual temperature is 57 to 63 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 180 to 240 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Arizo (NV), Hoppswell (NV) and Ustidur (NV)series. Arizo soils do not have a cambic horizon. Hoppswell soils have an argillic horizon and the Ustidur soils have a duripan. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; very low or low runoff; moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly blackbrush, mohave buckwheat, buckhorn cholla, black grama, big galleta and desert needlegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert  of southern Nevada. MLRA 30. These soils are moderately extensive.
