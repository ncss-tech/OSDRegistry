LOLON SERIES

The Lolon series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils formed in gravelly alluvium or outwash.  These soils are on alluvial fans or moraines.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Pachic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lolon loam - native sod cover.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     A1--0 to 8 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium and fine crumb structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; many very fine roots and interstitial pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear boundary.

     A2--8 to 17 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; dark brown (10YR 4/3) coats on peds, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium to fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; many very fine roots and tubular pores; 25 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (A1 horizon is 16 to 24 inches thick.)

     C1--17 to 28 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) coats on peds, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; many very fine roots and interstitial pores; 50 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual irregular boundary.  (6 to 16 inches thick)

     IIC2--28 to 40 inches; loose sand, gravel and some cobble.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Excessively drained; moderate above the 2C horizon; rapid permeability in the 2C horizon.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for native range and for hayland.  Native vegetation is bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue and Sandberg bluegrass, with numerous annuals.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The Lolon soils are in mountain valleys of western Montana and Wyoming.  They are inextensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Granite County (Philipsburg-Drummond Area), Montana, 1972.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
A mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 17 inches (A horizons); a lithologic discontinuity at 28 inches (2C horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (A2, C1 and part of the 2C2 horizon). Lolon soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
