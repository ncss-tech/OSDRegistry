LAKOA SERIES

The Lakoa series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum weathered from interbedded sandstone and shale on uplands.  Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 510 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lakoa loam - on a northeast-facing slope of 32 percent under ponderosa pine forest at an elevation of about 1,085 meters.  When described, the soil was dry throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Bt2--63 to 86 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; organoargillans on faces of peds; few sandstone fragments; neutral; gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 35 to 64 cm.)

    Bk--86 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; few sandstone fragments, common fine accumulations of lime; strong effervescence; slightly alkaline.

Landscape/aspect:  mainly on north- and east-facing slopes or protected cove-like positions
Slopes:  2 to 60 percent
Elevation:  975 to 1,460 meters
Mean annual air temperature:  5 to 8 degrees C 
Mean annual precipitation:  432 to 584 millimeters 
Precipitation pattern:  In most years, more than half of the annual precipitation occurs as snow and rain from April through July.
Frost-free period:  100 to 140 days.

Butche - lithic contact at less than 50 centimeters; they occur on adjacent backslopes and dipslopes
Boneek - has a mollic epipedon; they occur on less-sloping landscapes below the Lakoa soils

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high; medium to very high runoff, depending on slope.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Lakoa soils are used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, recreation, and homesite and urban development.  Native vegetation is ponderosa pine, bur oak, with an understory of shrubs, sedges, little bluestem, and green needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Lakoa soils occur on the Hogback physiographic area in the Black Hills Footslopes in western South Dakota and northeastern Wyoming, and in western North Dakota; LRR G, MLRA 61; the series is of moderate extent.
