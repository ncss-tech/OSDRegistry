COMPETING SERIES: These are the Alamogordo, Borderline, Hobcan, Monahans, Monzingo, and Ugyp soils. Alamogordo (MLRA 42B) and Monahans (MLRA 42A) soils do not receive significant amounts of winter precipitation and have most of the rainfall occuring as high-intensity, convective thunderstorms from midspring to midautumn. Borderline (MLRA 41) soils are on fan terraces with slopes from 2 to 15 percent. Hobcan soils are on alluvial fans and fan terraces with 1 to 5 percent slopes and have a hue of 5YR or 7.5YR in the A and Bk horizons. Monzingo (MLRA 41) soils are on dissected relict lake beds and formed in mixed alluvium from prehistoric lakes and marshes. Ugyp (MLRA 41) soils are on alluvial fans with slopes from 0 to 5 percent and have 5 to 10 percent gypsum in the Bky horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Littlesignal soils are on hillslopes. Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. These soils formed in material weathered from sandstone and/or shale. They occur at elevations of 227 to 942 meters (740 to 3,090 feet). The climate is arid with hot dry summers and cool, somewhat moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 152 to 203 mm (6 to 8 inches). Mean January temperature is 8 degrees C (46 degrees F); mean July temperature is 28 degrees C (82 degrees F); mean annual temperature varies from 16 to 18 degrees C (60 degrees to 64 degrees F). Frost-free season is 240 to 300 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ballinger, Cochora, and Pyxo soils. Ballinger soils on hills are moderately deep, have a fine particle-size class and have a smectitic mineralogy class. Cochora soils on hills are shallow, have a loamy particle-size class, and have a calcareous mineralogy class. Pyxo soils on hills and mountains are moderately deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; high runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for spring grazing of sheep and cattle. Some areas are used for oil production. Natural vegetation consists of red brome, fiddleneck, redstem filaree, turkey mullen, allscale, saltbrush, and pine bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Signal Hills, Temblor Range, and Telephone Hills along the southeast border of Kern and San Luis Obispo Counties, MLRA 15. This soil is not extensive.
