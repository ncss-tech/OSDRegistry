LEAVITT SERIES 

The Leavitt series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium derived from crystalline and sedimentary rock.  Leavitt soils are on relict fan aprons, coalescing fans, terraces, hills and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 0 to 55 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Ustic Argicryolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Leavitt silt loam, rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated).

    A--0 to 7 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) silt loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; strong medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 8 inches thick) 

    Bt1--7 to 12 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong very fine subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; many prominent clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent rounded gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  

    Bt2--12 to 29 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and medium roots; many prominent clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 5 percent rounded gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual smooth boundary. (combined thickness of Bt horizons - 8 to 32 inches) 

    Btk--29 to 38 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/3) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and medium roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and in root channels and pores; slightly effervescent matrix and strongly effervescent near calcium carbonate masses and filaments; 10 percent rounded gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary. (5 to 12 inches thick) 

    Bk--38 to 60 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/3) loam, brown (7.5YR 5/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; violently effervescent and common soft masses and thin pendants of calcium carbonate on rock fragments; 10 percent rounded gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2)
