LEVENGOOD SERIES

The Levengood series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits derived from calcareous sedimentary rock.  These soils are on fan remnants, hills, mountain slopes and landslides. Slopes are 2 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 36 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Calcic Pachic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Levengood gravelly loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 6 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic, many very fine and fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; 20 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 20 inches thick)

    Bw--6 to 12 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 30 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 12 inches thick)

    Bk1--12 to 19 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine pores; 35 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; finely disseminated calcium carbonate and few fine masses of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (6 to 10 inches thick)

    Bk2--19 to 30 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 7/4) very gravelly fine sandy loam, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; 35 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; finely disseminated calcium carbonate and few fine masses of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth boundary. (9 to 29 inches thick)

    Bk3--30 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) very cobbly loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; 20 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles; finely disseminated calcium carbonate and few fine masses of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).
