LOTT SERIES

The Lott series consists of very deep to clayey marl, well drained soils that formed in calcareous clayey residuum weathered from chalk, claystone, shale, and siltstone of Cretaceous age. These gently to moderately sloping soils are on ridges on dissected plains.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 966 mm (38.03 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 19.3 degrees C (66.8 degrees F).

Austin soils: are on similar positions and are moderately deep to chalk. 
Heiden and Houston Black soils: have intersecting slickensides. 
Lewisville soils: are on risers and treads of adjacent stream terraces and are very deep to clayey alluvium
Stephen soils: are on adjacent summits on ridges and are shallow to a paralithic
Ponder and Sanger soils: are typically on lower positions in the landscape.  In addition, Ponder soils have a clayey argillic horizon and Sanger soils have intersecting slickensides.

Drainage class: Well; 
Permeability class: Moderately slow
Runoff: medium on slopes of 1 to 5 percent and and high on slopes of 5 to 8 percent;

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mostly cultivated to small grains, cotton, and grain sorghum.  Original vegetation was mid and tall grasses such as little bluestem, indiangrass, and sideoats grama.  Grasses now are mainly gramas and buffalograss.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  This soil occurs in the Texas Blackland Prairies, Northern Part (MLRA 86A). The series is of moderate extent.
