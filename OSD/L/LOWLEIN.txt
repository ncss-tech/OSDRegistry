LOWLEIN SERIES

The Lowlein series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of outwash sediments and in the underlying loamy calcareous till or lacustrine sediments. These soils are on nearly level or convex slopes on ground moraines, glacial lake plains and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 735 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Oxyaquic Hapludolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Lowlein sandy loam, on a north-facing slope of 2 percent, in a corn field, at an elevation of about 338 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

 Ap--0 to 25 centimeters; black (10YR 2/1) sandy loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; weak fine granular structure; friable; common roots; about 1 percent rock fragments; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (15 to 25 centimeters thick) 

 A--25 to 36 centimeters; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) sandy loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few roots; about 1 percent rock fragments; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. (0 to 24 centimeters thick) 

 Bw1--36 to 61 centimeters; brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; about 2 percent rock fragments; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. (10 to 30 centimeters thick)

 3Cg--79 to 152 centimeters; olive gray (5Y 5/2) loam; massive; friable; common medium distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) iron concentrations; about 3 percent rock fragments; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 36 centimeters (Ap and A horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 36 to 79 centimeters (Bw1 and 2Bw2 horizons);
udic moisture regime. 

Oxyaquic subgroup based on a zone of saturation within 100 centimeters for 20 or more consecutive days or 30 or more cumulative days in years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation. 

A firm till substratum phase with a moist bulk density range from 1.65 to 1.75 g/cc is recognized in MLRA 103 on the Coteau Slope (bench) physiographic area.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
