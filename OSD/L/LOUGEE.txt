LOUGEE SERIES

The Lougee series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in 40 to 130 centimeters of moderately decomposed organic material over sandy glaciolacustrine, outwash, or fluvial deposits. These soils are on flats and depressions within glacial lake plains and outwash plains and less frequently on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 690 mm.  Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, euic, frigid Terric Haplohemists

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lougee peat, on a plane slope of less than 1 percent in a marsh at an elevation of about 369 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Oi1--0 to 8 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) broken face, rubbed, and pressed peat (fibric material); about 95 percent fiber, 85 percent rubbed; massive; primarily sphagnum fibers; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.

 Oi2--8 to 30 cm; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) broken face, rubbed, and pressed peat (fibric material); about 90 percent fiber, 80 percent rubbed; massive; primarily herbaceous fibers; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the Oi horizons is 0 to 33 cm)

 Oe--30 to 71 cm; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) broken face, rubbed, and pressed mucky peat (hemic material); about 65 percent fiber, 40 percent rubbed; massive; primarily herbaceous fibers; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (30 to 130 cm thick)

 2A--71 to 79 cm; black (10YR 2/1) mucky loamy fine sand; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; friable; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 20 cm thick)

 2ACg--79 to 117 cm; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) fine sand; single grain; loose; neutral; gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 40 cm thick)  

 2Cg--117 to 203 cm; gray (5Y 5/1) fine sand; single grain; loose; neutral.

TYPE LOCATION:  Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) 91A-Central Minnesota Sandy Outwash; Crow Wing County, Minnesota; about  one mile southeast of Merrifield; located about 170 feet north and 1560 feet east of the southwest corner of section 36, T. 135 N., R. 27 W.; USGS Merrifield, Minn. topographic quadrangle; lat. 46 degrees 29 minutes 25 seconds N. and long. 94 degrees 09 minutes 19 seconds W., NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
The organic part of the control section is derived primarily from herbaceous plants. The depth to the sandy mineral substrata ranges from 40 to 130 centimeters. The rock fragment content of the 2C horizon ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The coarse fragments are dominantly gravel of mixed lithology. The depth to carbonates is greater than 200 cm

Oi horizon (where present):
Hue--7.5YR or 10YR
Value--2 or 3
Chroma--2 to 4
Texture--peat
Reaction--slightly acid to very strongly acid

Oe horizon:
Hue--7.5YR or 10YR
Value--2 to 4
Chroma--1 to 4
Texture--mucky peat of herbaceous origin
Reaction--neutral to moderately acid

2A horizon (where present):
Hue--10YR
Value--2 or 3
Chroma--1 or is neutral
Texture--fine sand, loamy fine sand, sand, loamy sand, or their mucky analogues
Reaction--neutral to moderately acid  

2ACg horizon (where present):
Hue--7.5YR to 2.5Y
Value--2 to 4
Chroma--1 or 2
Texture--fine sand, loamy fine sand, sand or loamy sand
Reaction--neutral to moderately acid

2Cg horizon:
Hue--7.5YR to 5Y
Value--4 to 6
Chroma--1 or 2
Texture--fine sand, loamy fine sand, sand or loamy sand
Coarse fragments--0 to 15 percent gravel sized rock fragments 
Some pedons contain stratified sediments 
Reaction--neutral to moderately acid

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series. Markey is a closely related series. Markey soils formed in highly decomposed organic material and are in the Terric Haplosaprists Subgroup.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material--moderately decomposed organic materials of herbaceous origin overlying sandy glaciolacustrine, outwash, or fluvial sediments
Landform--depressions or large level areas within glacial lake plains, outwash plains and floodplains.
Slope--0 to 2 percent
Elevation--300 to 436 meters above sea level
Mean annual air temperature--2 to 6 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation--650 to 750 mm
Frost-free period--100 to 140 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  At the type location these are the Zimmerman, Guida, Barber and Rifle soils.  The somewhat excessively drained Zimmerman, moderately well drained Guida and the somewhat poorly drained Barber soils are on the adjacent or surrounding mineral uplands.  The very poorly drained Rifle soils are in landscape positions similar to Lougee and developed in organic material more than 130 cm thick.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Very poorly drained.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is 42.34 to 141.14 micrometers per second (6 to 20 inches per hour) in the organic material and 14.11 to 141.14 micrometers per second (0.6 to 20 inches per hour) in the underlying mineral sediment.  Lougee soils have seasonal high saturation at the surface during spring and fall in normal years.  Lougee soils that occupy depressions frequently pond during spring and fall in normal years and after periods of heavy rainfall. Lougee soils on flood plains flood frequently for brief to long duration during spring in normal years and after periods of heavy rainfall.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are marshes or shrub swamps.  Vegetation includes sedges, cattails, mosses, alder and swamp birch.

Physiographic Section--Western Lake section
MLRAs--Central Minnesota Sandy Outwash (91A)
Wisconsin and Minnesota Thin Loess and Till, Northern Part (90A)

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Crow Wing County, Minnesota, 2010.
The source of the name is Lougee lake in Crow Wing County, Minnesota.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: Moderately decomposed organic materials (hemic) 30 to 71 centimeters (Oe horizon)
Terric subgroup--a mineral layer 30 centimeters or more thick between 30 and 130 centimeters(2A, 2ACg, and 2Cg horizons)
