LUNADA SERIES

The Lunada series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium weathered from calcareous shale. Lunada soils are on steep side slopes and canyon slopes of hills and mountains. Slopes range from 10 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 17.2 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Calcixerepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Lunada loam, in a thick stand of sagebrush on a steep canyon sideslope at an elevation of 214 meters. When described the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.)

 Oi--0 to 3 centimeters; dark gray (10YR 4/1) slightly decomposed plant material; slightly acid (pH 6.5); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 5 cm thick)

 A--3 to 7 centimeters; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) loam, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; weak medium granular structure; very friable, slightly hard, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; 5 percent channers; slightly effervescent; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 40 cm thick)

 Bk1--7 to 44 centimeters; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) very channery loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and common medium roots; few fine tubular pores; few faint clay bridges between sand grains; finely disseminated calcium carbonate and common fine irregular white (10YR 8/1) calcium carbonate masses; 45 percent channers; slightly effervescent; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary.

 Bk2--44 to 67 centimeters; very channery loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; few fine irregular pores; finely disseminated calcium carbonate, common fine irregular white (10YR 8/1) calcium carbonate masses and common medium spherical, weakly cemented, white (10YR 8/1) calcium carbonate concretions; 55 percent channers; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.

 Bk3--67 to 83 centimeters; very channery loam, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) moist; massive; friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; finely disseminated calcium carbonate and many medium irregular, white (10YR 8/1) calcium carbonate masses; 40 percent channers and 10 percent flagstones; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary.

 Bk4--83 to 120 centimeters; extremely channery loam, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) moist; massive; friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; finely disseminated calcium carbonate and common medium irregular white (10YR 8/1) calcium carbonate masses; 75 percent channers; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of Bk horizons is 75 to 120 cm)

 R--120 centimeters; indurated shale bedrock.
