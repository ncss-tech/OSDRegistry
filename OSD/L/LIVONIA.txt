LIVONIA SERIES

The Livonia series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in sandy over loamy glaciolacustrine deposits typically covered by a surface mantle of sandy or loamy human transported material. These soils formed on low beach ridges, deltas, drainageways, nearshore zones, and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 860 mm and mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Algansee, Altmar, Birchwood, Brems, Brockatonorton, Deerfield, Elnora, Fortress, Meckling, Morocco, Ottokee, Partridge, Succotash, Tedrow, and Zaborosky series. Algansee soils have an irregular decrease in organic matter with depth. Altmar soils average 10 percent or more rock fragments in the particle size control section. Birchwood soils have densic materials within 50 to 97 cm of the mineral soil surface. Brems, Elnora and Ottokee soils do not have redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less within a depth of 60 cm. Brockatonorton soils have a buried histic epipedon in the lower part of the series control section. Deerfield soils have very strongly to slightly acid reaction and Morocco soils have very strongly to moderately acid reaction in the lower part of the series control section. Fortress soils have human transported material 100 to 200 cm thick. Meckling soils are calcareous throughout the series control section. Partridge soils have a lithic contact between 51 and 102 cm. Succotash soils do not have a B horizon. Tedrow soils do not have loamy material within the series control section. Zaborosky soils have a surface mantle of new soil material thicker than 50 cm. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Livonia soils are on low beach ridges, deltas, drainageways, lake plains, and nearshore zones. They are on level or nearly level surfaces and typically have slope gradients of 0 to 4 percent but range to 6 percent. The soils formed in sandy over loamy glaciolacustrine deposits typically covered by a surface mantle of sandy or loamy human transported material except for pedons located in forest preserves and cropland areas that typically do not have human transported material. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 720 to 960 mm. Mean annual temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C. Frost-free period is 135 to 210 days.  

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Belleville, Brems, Brems loamy substratum, Kibbie and Rapson soils. The poorly drained Belleville soils are in low topographic positions or in depressions. The moderately well drained Brems and Brems loamy substratum soils are on more sloping areas. The Kibbie soils are loamy throughout and Rapson soils have a sandy over loamy particle size control section. Both Kibbie and Rapson soils are on landscape positions similar to Livonia. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the sandy material and moderately low or moderately high in the underlying loamy material.  In areas where the soil has been compacted the saturated hydraulic conductivity is low.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are typically covered by turfgrass and common weeds and used for recreation, urban, and industrial development. Some areas are wooded. Common trees are mixed hardwoods with oak, elm, and red maple being the principal species. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Michigan; MLRA 99. Theses soils are of small extent with about 2,750 acres of the series mapped. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Amherst, Massachusetts 

SERIES PROPOSED: Wayne County, Michigan, 2016.  The name is after the City of Livonia, Wayne County, Michigan. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Human transported material - the zone from 0 to 36 cm (^A and ^C horizons).  
Ochric epipedon - the zone from a depth of 36 to 53 cm (Ab horizon).
Aquic conditions - redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less in all horizons below a depth of 53 cm. 

The loamy substratum phase of Tedrow soils mapped in earlier surveys has a loamy substratum within 152 cm. The Livonia series will likely replace the Tedrow soils with a loamy glaciolacustrine substratum on deltas, drainageways, beach ridges, and nearshore zones. 

A substratum phase of dense till with 32 to 52 percent clay is recognized within a depth of 150 to 200 cm.
