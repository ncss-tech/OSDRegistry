LEAPS SERIES

The Leaps series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, slope alluvium, or colluvium mainly from shale, with influence from sandstone in places.  These soils are on alluvial fans, structural benches, mountain slopes, mesas, hills, and valley sides.  Slopes are 3 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic Vertic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Leaps clay loam - on a northeast-facing slope at 9,200 feet elevation in rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 10 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; neutral; clear wavy boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick)

    Bw--10 to 18 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common pressure faces; neutral; gradual wavy boundary.

    BC--18 to 35 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common pressure faces: neutral; gradual wavy boundary.

    C--35 to 60 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; neutral.

TYPE LOCATION:  San Miguel County Colorado; about 14 miles south of Norwood; about 2,500 feet south and 1,900 feet east of the northwest corner of Sec. 2, T. 42 N., R. 14 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: dry in some part of the moisture control section for greater than 45 cumulative days
Mean annual soil temperature: 37 to 42 degrees F.
Mean summer soil temperature: 53 to 55 degrees F. 
Base saturation: 80 to 100 percent throughout
Thickness of the mollic epipedon: 7 to 15 inches

Particle-size control section (weighted averages):
Clay content: 35 to 55 percent
Rock fragment content: 0 to 35 percent, mostly gravel size, but range from 1/8 to 10 inches in diameter. 

A horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR to 2.5Y
Value: 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 1 to 3, dry or moist
Texture: SIL, SICL, L, CL
Reaction: moderately acid to neutral

Bw horizon (cambic horizon):
Hue: 5YR to 2.5Y
Value: 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 2 to 6, dry or moist
Texture: SIC, C, CL
Reaction: moderately acid to neutral

BC and C horizons:
Hue: 5YR to 5Y
Value: 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 7 moist
Chroma: 2 to 6, dry or moist
Texture: CL, SICL, SIC, C
Clay content: 30 to 60 percent
Reaction: moderately acid to neutral

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Elkhead series.
Elkhead soils:  have a calcic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  noncalcareous alluvium, slope alluvium, or colluvium derived mainly from shale, with influence from sandstone in some places.
Landform:  alluvial fans, structural benches, mountain slopes, mesas, hills, and valley sides.
Slopes:  3 to 50 percent.
Elevation:  7,600 to 10,500 feet.
Mean annual temperature:  35 to 42 degrees F.
Mean summer temperature:  52 to 54 degrees F.
Average annual precipitation:  18 to 29 inches.
Wettest months:  July and August
Driest months:  All other months have about the same amount of precipitation.
Frost-free period:  40 to 75 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bucklon and Judy series.   Bucklon soils have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 20 inches.  Judy soils have an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; very slow or slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for livestock grazing and for recreational purposes.  Native vegetation is mainly wheatgrass, nodding brome, stipa, and larkspur.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mountain areas of central and southwestern Colorado.  MLRA 48A.  The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Gunnison County, Taylor River Soil Survey Area, Colorado, 1968.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon: from 0 to 10 inches (A horizon).
Cambic horizon: from 10 to 18 inches (Bw horizon)
Particle-size control section: the zone from 10 to 40 inches (Bw, BC, and part of the C horizon).

The field concept of the moisture regime of this soil is an ustic regime, although ustic is not recognized in cryic temperature regimes.
