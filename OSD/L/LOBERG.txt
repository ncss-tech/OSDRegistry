LOBERG SERIES

The Loberg series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till, alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits derived from mixed rock sources.  These soils are on till plains, moraines, alluvial fans, mountains, hills or landslides.  Slopes are 2 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Glossocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Loberg stony clay loam with .05 percent stones on the surface, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

   Oi--0 to 2 inches; forest litter and humus. (1 to 4 inches thick)

   E--2 to 5 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak thick platy structure parting to moderate fine granular; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; sand grains are clear and unstained; 15 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; strongly acid (pH 5.1); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 20 inches thick)

   E/Bt--5 to 14 inches; E part (75 percent) light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) stony loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist, tongues; Bt part (25 percent) pale brown (10YR 6/3) stony clay, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; continuous distinct clay films on faces of peds which are coated with clear unstained sand grains; 15 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones; strongly acid (pH 5.2); clear wavy boundary.

   Bt1--14 to 29 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very stony clay, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; strong fine and medium blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; continuous prominent clay films on faces of peds; continuous prominent clay films on gravel surfaces; common fine roots; stones and 20 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles and 10 percent; moderately acid (pH 5.6); gradual boundary.

   Bt2--29 to 51 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very stony clay, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; strong fine and medium blocky structure parting to moderate medium blocky in lower part; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine roots; continuous prominent clay films on faces of peds; continuous prominent clay films of surface of gravel; 20 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual boundary. (combined thickness of Bt1, Bt2 horizons - 17 to 55 inches)

   Bt3--51 to 68 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very stony clay, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; very weak fine and medium blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine roots; common faint clay film of faces of peds; common distinct clay films on surface of gravel; 25 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt boundary. (0 to 18 inches thick)

   BC--68 to 72 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) stony clay, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine pores; continuous faint clay film on surface of gravel; 25 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).
