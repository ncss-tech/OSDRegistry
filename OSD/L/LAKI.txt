The superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The superactive cation exchange activity class was confirmed by lab sample S2015OR035011.

05/2022: The classification was changed from fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haploxerolls to fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Vitrandic Haploxerolls based on characterization data of S2015OR035011.
