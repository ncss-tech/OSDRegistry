LUPINE SERIES

Depth class: very deep
Drainage class: well drained
Parent material: loamy alluvium overlying sand and gravel
Landform: alluvial plains and terraces
Slopes: 0 to 3 percent
Mean annual temperature: about 25 degrees F., -4 C.
Mean annual precipitation: about 11 inches, 280 mm 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Typic Haplocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Lupine silt loam -- on a 0 percent slope under black spruce and quaking aspen forest at 1100 feet elevation. (Colors are described for moist soils) 

	Oi--0 to 4 inches, (0 to 10 cm); dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) slightly decomposed organic matter; very strongly acid (pH 4.8); clear smooth boundary. 

	A--4 to 7 inches, (10 to 18 cm); dark brown (10YR 3/3) silt loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure, parting to weak fine granular; friable; slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and coarse roots; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear wavy boundary. 

	Bw--7 to 15 inches, (18 to 38 cm); brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam; moderate fine platy structure; friable; slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; moderately acid (pH 5.8); abrupt smooth boundary. 

	2C1--15 to 19 inches, (38 to 48 cm); olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) fine sand; single grain; loose; nonsticky and nonplastic; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary. 

	2C2--19 to 60 inches, (48 to 152 cm); variegated extremely gravelly sand; single grain; loose; nonsticky and nonplastic; 55 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0). 

TYPE LOCATION: Gerstle River Area, Alaska; about 20 miles east-southeast of Delta Junction; SW 1/4 of the SE 1/4 of section 35, T.10S., R.13E. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Organic layer thickness: 1 to 9 inches, 2 to 23 cm
Solum thickness: 10 to 20 inches, 25 to 51 cm

O horizon:
Matrix color: hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; chroma of 2 or 3.
Reaction class: very strongly acid to moderately
 
A or Ap horizon (when present):
Matrix color: hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y; value of 2 to 4; chroma of 1 to 3
Texture: silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam
Reaction class: strongly acid to neutral

Bw horizon and BC horizon (where present): hue of 10YR or 7.5YR; value of 3 to 5; chroma of 3 to 6
Texture: silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam
Reaction class: strongly acid to neutral

2C horizon:
Matrix color: variegated
Texture: fine sand, sand, or gravelly sand in upper part; very gravelly sand or extremely gravelly sand in lower part
Coarse fragments: 0 to 75 percent total coarse fragments; 0 to 60 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles
Reaction class: moderately acid to neutral throughout

COMPETING SERIES: There are Maclaren and Sawmill Creek. Maclaren soils have stratified texture in the upper part of the profile. Sawmill Creek soils have calcium carbonate in the low part of the substratum

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loamy alluvium overlying sand and gravel
Landform: alluvial plains and terraces
Slopes: 0 to 3 percent
Climate: boreal continental, with short, warm summers and long cold winters
Mean annual temperature: is 21 to 28 degrees F., -5.5 to 2.2 C.
Mean annual precipitation: 9 to 13 inches, 288 to 330 mm 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Moosehead, Gerstle, Jarvis, Salchaket, Beales, and Tanacross soils. Moosehead and Gerstle soils occur on the alluvial plain where the loamy mantle over sand and gravel is thicker. Jarvis and Salchaket soils occur in flooded areas between Moosehead soils and rivers. Beales soils occur on low dunes on the alluvial plain. Tanacross soils occur where a thick organic mat, thick loamy surface layer, and permafrost is present. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, low runoff, saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the solum and high to very high in substratum 

USE AND VEGETATION: Lupine soils support forests dominated by black spruce, white spruce, quaking aspen, and paper birch. Cleared areas are used for small grains, forages, and vegetables. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 229 Interior Alaska Lowlands. The extent of this series is of moderate extent. 

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: WASILLA, ALASKA

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Gerstle River Area, Alaska, 1991. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic features and horizons recognized in this profile include:
Ochric epipedon: 4 to 7 inches, 10 to 18 cm
Cambic horizon: 7 to 15 inches, 18 to 38 cm
Particle size control section: of coarse-loamy from 10 to 15 inches, 25 to 38 cm and sandy-skeletal from 15 to 44 inches, 38 to 101 cm (weighted average)
Temperature regime: cryic
Moisture regime: udic

Due to their low water holding capacity, permafrost probably will not form in Lupine soils by forest succession as it can in soils with a thicker loamy surface layer.
