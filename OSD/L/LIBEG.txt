LIBEG SERIES

The Libeg series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, outwash, colluvium, till or slide deposits.  These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans, fan remnants, alpine moraines, outwash plains, hills, mountain slopes, ridges, escarpments, avalanche chutes and landslides.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.
