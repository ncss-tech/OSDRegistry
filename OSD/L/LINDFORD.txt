LINDFORD SERIES

The Lindford series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in stratified alluvial deposits. These soils are on stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 600 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Aquic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Lindford silty clay loam, on a flat of 1 percent slope, in a hay field, on a stream terrace, at an elevation of about 370 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

    Ap--0 to 12 centimeters; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; very friable; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. (10 to 20 centimeters thick)

    Bt1--12 to 34 centimeters; brown (10YR 4/3) silty clay loam; strong medium subangular blocky structure; friable; many continuous faint brown (10YR 4/3) clay films on faces of peds and in pores; few fine faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. 

    Bt2--34 to 51 centimeters; brown (10YR 4/3) silty clay loam; strong medium angular blocky structure; friable; many continuous faint brown (10YR 4/3) clay films on faces of peds and in pores; few fine distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) redoximorphic concentrations and few fine distinct gray (10YR 5/1) redoximorphic depletions; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizon ranges 10 to 45 centimeters) 

    C1--51 to 83 centimeters; olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) clay loam; massive; friable; few fine distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) redoximorphic concentrations and few fine distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) redoximorphic depletions; neutral; clear smooth boundary. 

    C2--83 to 102 centimeters; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam; massive; friable; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations and common medium distinct gray (10YR 5/1) redoximorphic depletions; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the C horizon ranges 25 to 80 centimeters)

    Cg1--102 to 130 centimeters; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay loam; massive; friable; many medium prominent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) redoximorphic concentrations; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. 

    Cg2--130 to 142 centimeters; gray (2.5Y 5/1) stratified very fine sandy loam and silt loam; massive; friable; many coarse prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations and many coarse faint gray (10YR 6/1) redoximorphic depletions; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.

    Cg3--142 to 203 centimeters; gray (2.5Y 5/1) stratified very fine sandy loam and silt loam; massive; friable; many coarse prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations and many coarse faint light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) redoximorphic depletions; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) 88-Northern Minnesota Glacial Lake Basins; Koochiching County, Minnesota; about 1/2 mile east of Littlefork; 800 feet south and 600 feet east of the northwest corner of section 10, T. 68 N., R. 25 W.; USGS Littlefork, Minnesota topographic quadrangle; lat. 48 degrees 23 minutes 21 seconds N., and long. 93 degrees 32 minutes 26 seconds W., NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

The lower third of the series control section has more than 50 percent very fine sand

Ap or A horizon:
Hue-10YR
Value-4, 6 dry
Chroma-2 or 3, 2 dry
Texture-silty clay loam, silt loam, loam or very fine sandy loam
Reaction-moderately acid to neutral
Some pedons have a thin O horizon
Some pedons have E horizons

Bt horizon:
Hue-10YR or 2.5Y
Value-4 or 5
Chroma-3 or 4
Texture-silty clay loam or clay loam

Few to many faint or distinct clay films

C horizon:
Hue-2.5Y or 10YR
Value-4 or 5
Chroma-3 or 4
Texture-silty clay loam or clay loam
Reaction-slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline

Cg horizon:
Hue-2.5Y or 10YR

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Baudette and Potatolake series.
Baudette soils--have soil saturation in the upper part of the series control section
Potatolake soils--have more than 50 percent very fine sand or coarser in the lower third of the series control section

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--stratified alluvial deposits
Landform--stream terraces
Slope--0 to 3 percent
Elevation--300 to 500 meters above sea level
Mean annual air temperature--4 to 6 degrees C.
Mean annual precipitation--500 to 700 millimeters
Frost free period--90 to 120 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Littlefork soil which formed in the same parent material as the Lindford soils. Littlefork soils are moderately well drained and are on more sloping areas.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class--somewhat poorly drained--these soils have a frequently saturated zone occurring between depths of 30 and 36 centimeters during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean annual precipitation, this saturation is considered apparent 
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--0.42 to 14.1 micrometers per second
Floodingnot flooded to occasionally flooded for a brief duration from snow melt events

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cropped for hay.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Physiographic Division--Interior Plains or Laurentian Upland
Physiographic Province--Central Lowland or Superior Upland 
MLRA--Northern Minnesota Glacial Lake Basins (88)
