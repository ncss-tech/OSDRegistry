COMPETING SERIES: These are the Buffalo Tiger (FL),  Palmar (PR), Saladar (PR), and Tiburones (PR) series. 
Buffalo Tiger soils have limestone at depths less than 203 centimeters (80 inches) and occur on similar landform positions.
Palmar soils have hue colors only as 2.5Y, lack alkaline reactions and occur on coastal plains and flood plains on the northern coast of Puerto Rico.
Saladar soils have water in the profile slightly deeper, lack alkaline soil reactions, can have hemic soil materials, and occur on closed depressions and coastal marshes of Puerto Rico.
Tiburones soils lack alkaline soil reactions, are limited to color hues of N or 10YR and occur on low flats and depressions of Puerto Rico.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landscape: Florida Everglades and Lower Coastal Plain
Landform(s): Talfs, rises, and/or dips in freshwater marshes and swamps of the Everglades and depressions on flatwoods areas.   
Parent material: thick organic materials overlying limestone bedrock at depths greater than 203 centimeters. 
Mean annual air temperature: 25 to 27 degrees C. (77 to 81 degrees F.)
Mean annual precipitation: 1118 to 1651 millimeters (44 to 65 inches) 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
Cooper Town soils have limestone bedrock within 18 to 50 centimeters (7 to 20 inches) of the surface and occur in similar landform positions.
Gator Lake soils have limestone bedrock within 18 centimeters (7 inches) of the surface and occur in similar landform positions.
Macks Camp soils have limestone at depths of 100 to 150 centimeters (40 to 60 inches) and occur on similar landform positions. 
Plantation soils have sandy layers more than 25 centimeters (10 inches) thick below the organic layer and above the limestone.  Plantation soils have limestone bedrock at depths of 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches).
Shark Valley soils have limestone at depths of 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) and are in similar landform positions.
Tamiami soils have subsurface horizons of freshwater marl that compose less than 1/2 the thickness of the control section and occur in similar landform positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class: Very poorly drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (KSAT): High to very high
Surface runoff: Negligible
Flooding frequency and duration: Sawgrass plains are very frequently flooded for very long periods, during the dry season or in drought conditions there may be no flooding. In natural conditions, flooding occurs for very long duration of 9 to 11 months. Tree Islands are occasionally flooded for brief periods during periods of heavy rainfall, severe storms, and hurricanes. Currently flooding is controlled by anthropogenic activities.
Ponding frequency and duration: depressions on flatwoods areas are covered by water (ponded) very frequently for very long duration 9 to 11 months. 

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Major Uses: Water quality, water storage, and wildlife habitat. 
Dominant vegetation: sawgrass, sedges, lilies, spikerush, willow, elderberry, pond apple, and cypress. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  MLRA 156A Florida Everglades and associated areas.  
This series is of moderate extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE:  Auburn, Alabama.
