COMPETING SERIES: These are the Buffalo Tiger and Keylargo series. 
Buffalo Tiger soils--have bedrock at depths less than 203 centimeters (80 inches) and occur in similar landform positions.
Keylargo soils--have bedrock at depths less than 203 centimeters (80 inches), are subject to daily flooding by marine water, are dominated by mangroves, and occur in the tidal zone.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landscape: Florida Everglades
Landform(s): Talfs, rises, and/or dips in fresh water marshes and swamps 
Parent material: organic materials formed from remains of hydrophytic herbaceous plant overlying limestone bedrock. 
Mean annual air temperature: 24 to 26 degrees C (75 to 79 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 112 to 160 centimeters (44 to 63 inches) 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: In addition to the competing Buffalo Tiger soils, these are:
Coopertown soils--have limestone bedrock within 20 to 51 centimeters (8 to 20 inches) of the surface and occur in similar landform positions.
Gator Lake soils--have limestone bedrock within 5 to 18 centimeters (2 to 7 inches) of the surface and occur in similar landform positions.
Macks Camp soils--have bedrock at depths of 102 to 130 centimeters (40 to 51 inches) and occur on similar landform positions. 
Plantation soils--have sandy layers below the organic layer and above the limestone bedrock.Shark Valley soils--have bedrock at depths of 51 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) and are in similar landform positions.
Tamiami soils--have subsurface horizons of freshwater marl that compose less than 1/2 the thickness of the control section and occur in similar landform positions.
