LUSTER SERIES

The Luster series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Luster soils are on footslopes.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Sandy, mixed, mesic Ustic Torriorthents 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Luster loamy fine sand , on a north facing, convex, 8 percent slope in pastureland at an elevation of 5470 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on August 16, 1988 the soil was dry below a depth of 12 inches.

    
    Ap1--0 to 3 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) loamy fine sand, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 12 inches thick)

    Ap2--3 to 8 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 8 inches thick)

   AB--8 to 12 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 6 inches thick)

    Bk1--12 to 32 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) loamy fine sand, reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; 10 percent gravel; slightly effervescent, calcium carbonates segregated in few rounded fine soft masses and concretions and disseminated, 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent, slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 30 inches thick)

    Bk2--32 to 45 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) loamy fine sand, red (2.5YR 5/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; slightly effervescent, calcium carbonates segregated in few rounded fine soft masses and concretions and disseminated, 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent, moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick)

    Bk3--45 to 80 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) loamy fine sand, light reddish brown (2.5YR 6/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; slightly effervescent, calcium carbonates segregated in few rounded fine soft masses and concretions and disseminated, 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent, moderately alkaline.  (20 to 40 inches thick)

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no know competing series within this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Luster soils.
Parent material:  Slope alluvium derived from fine grained sandstone.
Landform:  Footslopes.
Slopes:  1 to 12 percent
Elevation: 5400 to 6500 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  48 to 51 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation:  10 to 13 inches.
  Wettest months:  August.
  Driest months:  June and July.
Frost-free period:  120 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Yarts and Escavada series. Yarts soils are coarse loamy.  Escavada soils are moderately well drained soils on floodplains. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Excessively well drained, slow runoff, moderately rapid permeability.  

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for rangeland, pastureland, and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation consists of needleandthread, sand dropseed, Indian ricegrass, and Wyoming big sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Luster soils occur in western Colorado.  LRR D, MLRA 34B.  This series is of small extent.
