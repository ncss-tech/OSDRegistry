LEDGER SERIES 

The Ledger series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in saline and sodic alluvium derived from mixed rock sources.  These soils are on flood plains, flood plain steps and drainageways.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Jefferson County, Montana, 1998. 

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1571.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the surface to 7 inches mixed (Az1 and Az2 horizons); an accumulation of salt and sodium from the surface to 60 inches (all horizons); a particle size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Cz1, Cz2, Ckzg1 and Ckzg2 horizons).  Ledger soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aquic.
