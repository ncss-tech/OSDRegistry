LOTUSPOINT SERIES

The Lotuspoint series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on mountains, hills, ridges, breaklands, and canyonsides. They formed in material weathered from metasedimentary bedrock with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess. Permeability is moderate. Slope ranges from 5 to 75 percent. The average annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F, and the average annual precipitation is about 32 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, isotic, mesic Andic Haploxerepts

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Terbies series.
Terbies soils: are deep to a lithic contact (sandstone) and have a medial sandy loam surface texture.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lotuspoint soils are on south aspects of mountains, hills,  ridges, breaklands, and canyonsides. Slopes range from 5 to 75 percent. These soils formed in material weathered from metasedimentary rocks with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess. Elevations range from 2,080 to 4,000 feet in East Benewah and Shoshone Counties and up to 4,950 feet in West Benewah County. The climate is warm, subhumid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The average annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 50 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 28 to 40 inches. The frost-free period is from 100 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ahrs, Honeyjones, Hugus, Pinecreek, and Tigley soils. Ahrs soils are on east and west-facing mountain slopes and are very deep. Honeyjones soils are on north-facing mountain slopes and are very deep. Hugus soils are on north-facing foothills, are very deep and have an argillic horizon. Pinecreek soils are on south-facing mountain slopes and are very deep. Tigley soils are on south-facing foothills, are very deep and have an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to very rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing, recreation, and wildlife habitat. Potential natural vegetation is mainly Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine, with an understory of common snowberry, bluebunch wheatgrass, creambush oceanspray, mallow ninebark, pine reedgrass, Idaho fescue, and low Oregon-grape.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Idaho. MLRA 43A. This soil is not extensive.

Classification change in 1/2005: from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Andic Dystroxerepts to Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Andic Haploxerepts based on Ninth Edition, 2003 taxonomic criteria and lab data.

Further investigation still needed regarding both the mixed vs. isotic mineralogy and the Andic vs. Vitrandic subgroup.

Classification change in 1/2009: from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Andic Haploxerepts to Loamy-skeletal, isotic, mesic Andic Haploxerepts.
