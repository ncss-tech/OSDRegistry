LABARGE SERIES

The Labarge series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed alluvium derived from interbedded sedimentary rock. These soils are on floodplains and floodplain steps. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 205 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 4.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Ustic Aquicambids

TYPICAL PEDON: Labarge loam in grass/herbaceous cover. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

 Oe--0 to 2 cm; moderately decomposed plant material; clear smooth boundary (0 to 7 cm thick)

 A--2 to 6 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; very friable, soft, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine tubular pores; finely disseminated carbonates; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 8 cm thick)

 Bk--6 to 37 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2), dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine tubular pores; 2 percent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) redox concentrations; finely disseminated carbonate; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 45 cm thick)

 C1--37 to 75 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; massive; friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common fine roots; 15 percent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) redox concentrations; finely disseminated carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2) ; clear smooth boundary. (20 to 50 cm thick)

 C2--75 to 200 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loamy coarse sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3), dry; single grain; loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; 15 percent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) redox concentrations; 25 percent grayish brown (10YR 5/2) redox depletions; finely disseminated carbonate; 30 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: somewhat poorly drained; 5.0 to 50 um/sec.

USE AND VEGETATION: Labarge soils are primarily used for irrigated hay land. The potential native vegetation is basin wildrye, thickspike wheatgrass, needle and thread, Letterman's needlegrass and other sedges, rushes, and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Labarge soils are of small extent in western Wyoming; MLRA 34A.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana
