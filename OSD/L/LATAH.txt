MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Benewah County, Idaho; 1930

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features in this pedon
*Mollic epipedon--zone from surface to a depth of 48 cm
*Albic horizon--zone from 48 to 76 cm
*Argillic horizon--zone from 76 to 150 cm

MLRA-wide investigation is needed to evaluate the influence and extent of volcanic ash in the Latah series.
