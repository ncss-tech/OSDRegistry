LATIERRA SERIES

The Latierra series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist.  Latierra soils are on toeslopes of eroded fan remnants.  Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Julesburg, Mainter, Manter, Mawer, Torrington, Truckton, and Vitrina series.  Julesburg, Mainter, Manter, Mawer, Torrington, and Truckton soils average less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and the solum.
Torrington soils are moderately deep to soft bedrock.
Truckton soils are noncalcareous to depths of more than 60 inches.
Vitrina soils have an aridic moisture regime bordering on ustic.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Latierra soils are on toeslopes of eroded fan remnants.  They formed in slope alluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist.  Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,500 to 7,300 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Lamesilla and Levante soils.  Lamesilla soils have recent alluvial mantles over thick mollic epipedons and occur on adjacent, frequently flooded inset fans.  Levante soils are sandy and occur on narrow flood plains of arroyos.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; low surface runoff; moderately rapid and moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Latierra soils are used for urban development, livestock grazing, and recreation.  The historic climax vegetation is blue grama, black grama, galleta, sideoats grama, oneseed juniper, twoneedle pinyon.  The ecological site is Gravelly(R036XB114NM).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Latierra soils are of small extent on the southeastern Espanola Basin part of the Basin and Range province in northcentral New Mexico.  The MLRA is 36.
