LOZINTA SERIES 

The Lozinta series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in slope alluvium from pyroclastics and cinders.  Lozinta soils are on cinder cones and have slopes of 1 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-skeletal over fragmental or cindery, mixed, mesic Vitrandic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lozinta extremely gravelly loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    A--0 to 2 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) extremely gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; many very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 70 percent cinders; neutral (pH 7.3); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 4 inches thick) 

    Bw1--2 to 10 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) extremely gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; many fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 70 percent cinders; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 20 inches thick) 

    Bw2--10 to 24 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; few fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 70 percent cinders; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt irregular boundary.  (9 to 18 inches thick) 

    2C--24 to 60 inches; black cinders; few very fine roots. 

TYPE LOCATION:  Mohave County, Arizona; about 6 miles east of Mount Trumbull; 1,700 feet west and 1,600 feet south of the northeast corner of section 20, T. 34 N., R. 8 W. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil Moisture:  Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July-September and December-February.  Driest during May and June.  Aridic ustic soil moisture regime. 

Rock Fragments:  65 to 80 percent cinders in the control section 

Cinder lag on the surface:  0 to 2 inches thick 

Depth to Cinders:  20 to 40 inches 

A horizon 
Hue:  10YR, 7.5YR, 5YR
Value: 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist 
Chroma:  2 through 4, dry or moist 
Reaction:  neutral to moderately alkaline 

B horizon 
Hue:  10YR, 7.5YR, 5YR
Value: 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist 
Chroma:  2 through 4, dry or moist 
Effervescence:  noneffervescent to violently effervescent; occurring as discontinuous irregular calcium carbonate veins, filaments or disseminated 
Calcium carbonate:  0 to 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent 
Reaction:  neutral to moderately alkaline 

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Wutoma (AZ) series.  Wutoma soils have cinders at depths of 10 to 20 inches. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lozinta soils are at elevations of 5,800 to 7,200 feet on cinder cones.  Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent.  The soil formed in slope alluvium derived dominantly from pyroclastics and cinders.  The climate is warm and semi-arid.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 18 inches occurring as summer thunderstorms and winter rain and snow.  Mean annual air temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 110 to 150 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Hatknoll, Moab and the competing Wutoma soils.  Hatknoll soils are clayey and Moab soils have a calcic horizon. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; low runoff; moderate or moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation is galleta, Mormon tea, blue grama, big sagebrush and Indian ricegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Arizona.  This soil is of minor extent. MLRA 35 & 39.
