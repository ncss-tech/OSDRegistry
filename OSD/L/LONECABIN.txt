LONECABIN SERIES 


The Lonecabin series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium derived from mixed sources such as metamorphic, volcanic and granitic rock. Lonecabin soils are on alluvial fans fan piedmonts and outwash terraces. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 350 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Lonecabin extremely stony sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered with 35 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, 25 percent stones and 1 percent boulders.

Chambeam soils are 100 to 150 cm to bedrock and have 20 to 30 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Climine soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section and a 2Bq horizon at 50 to 76 cm. Ginser soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 50 to 100 cm. Glean soils have a lithic contact at depths of 100 to 150 cm. Lambring soils average more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Rondowa soils have a strong influence from volcanic ash in the upper part and have less than 60 percent rock fragments in their particle-size control section. Sinker and Westbutte soils have a lithic contact at depths of 50 to 100 cm. Shorthike soils have a cambic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lonecabin soils are on alluvial fans, fan piedmonts and outwash terraces. They typically occur on summit positionsThey formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources such as metamorphic, volcanic and granitic rock. Slopes are 4 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 16,650 to 2,075 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 400 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 70 to 90 days.

All of these soils have more than 18 percent clay and less than 60 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section. In addition Canfire soils have a mollic epipedon thickness of 18 to 25 cm and have lithic contact at depths of 36 to 50 cm. Desertmann soils have a mollic epipedon thickness of 25 to 36 cm and have a duripan at depths of 76 to 100 cm. Grabbler soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in particle size control section and are saturated within depths of 50 to 76 cm. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low surface runoff; moderately rapid permeability; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Lonecabin soils are used for livestock grazing, watershed and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, Thurber's and western needlegrass and other perennial grasses and forbs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern California, east of the Sierra Nevada Range and in the western part of the Great Basin. These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 22.
