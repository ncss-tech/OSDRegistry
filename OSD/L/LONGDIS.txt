LONGDIS SERIES

The Longdis series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium over lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks and influenced by volcanic ash.  Longdis soils are on lake terraces and alluvial flats.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chappuis, Kiesel, Owinza, Standish, and Tomera series.

Chappuis, Kiesel, and Standish soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 12 to 13 degrees C.  Owinza soils are less than 50 cm to the base of the natric horizon.  Tomera soils have very gravelly or extremely gravelly C horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Longdis soils are on lake terraces and alluvial flats.  They formed in alluvium over lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks and influenced by volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,650 to 1,830 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dugway and Updike soils.  Dugway soils are moderately deep to duripans.  Updike soils are 15 to 30 inches to the base of the natric horizon and are on low terraces.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium surface runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Some phases of this soil are susceptible to occasional flooding for very brief periods between January and March.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Longdis soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is dominantly basin big sagebrush, silver sagebrush, black greasewood, and basin wildrye.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 23.
