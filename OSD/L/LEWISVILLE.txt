LEWISVILLE SERIES

The Lewisville series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in ancient loamy and clayey calcareous sediments.  These upland soils have slopes of 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (35.98 in.) and the mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C (65 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, active, thermic Udic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lewisville silty clay--pasture. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Ap--0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 in); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine subangular blocky and granular structure; hard, friable; contains a few strongly cemented calcium carbonate concretions; calcareous; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (Thickness of the Ap horizon is 0 to 18 cm [0 to 7 in])

    A--15 to 41 cm (6 to 16 in); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; few root channels; common strongly cemented calcium carbonate concretions about 2 to 5 mm in diameter; calcareous; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (Thickness of the A horizon is 18 to 38 cm [7 to 15 in])

    Bk1--41 to 86 cm (16 to 34 in); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm; common strongly cemented calcium carbonate concretions 2 to 5 mm in diameter; a few threads of soft calcium carbonate; calcareous; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (Thickness of the Bk1 horizon is 33 to 76 cm [13 to 30 in])

     Bk2--86 to 157 cm (34 to 62 in); pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay; brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; common soft masses of segregated calcium carbonate, few small, strongly cemented calcium carbonate concretions; calcareous; moderately alkaline.

Some pedons are underlain at depths of 0.9 to 4.6 m (3 to 15 ft) by sediments containing 15 to 50 percent gravel.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  Similar series are the Altoga, Austin, Nuvalde, Venus, and Volente series
Altoga and Austin soils: have more than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the control section, in addition, Altoga soils do not have mollic epipedons
Nuvalde soils: are dry in the moisture control section for longer periods. 
Venus soils: have fine-loamy control sections  
Volente soils: have more than 35 percent silicate clay content in the control section

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: loamy and clayey alluvium 
Landscape: river valley
Landform: stream terraces 
Slope: 0 to 10 percent, but they are mostly 2 to 6 percent
Mean annual precipitation:  711 to 1117 mm (28 to 44 in)
Thornthwaite P-E Index: 44 to 66
Mean annual air temperature:  16 to 21 degrees C (61 to 70 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 230 to 274 days
Elevation: 72 to 487.7 m (236 to 1600 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the competing Altoga, Venus, and Volente series and Eddy, Krum, and Stephen series.  
Altoga, Eddy, and Stephen soils: occur on erosional surfaces at higher elevations.  In addition, Eddy and Stephen soils are less than 51 cm (20 in) thick and are underlain by chalk or weakly cemented limestone.  Also, Eddy soils contain more than 35 percent by volume of coarse fragments. 
Krum, Venus, and Volente soils: occur at lower elevations as stream terraces or lower portions of narrow valleys.  In addition, Krum soils have clayey control sections and vertic features of cracking widely and deeply when dry.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  
Drainage class: Well; 
Permeability class: Moderate.
Runoff: negligible on slopes less than 1 percent; low on slopes of 1 to 5 percent; and medium on slopes of 5 to 10 percent; 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mostly cultivated, mainly to small grains.  Originally vegetation was mid and tall grasses and a few widely separated elm, hackberry, and mesquite trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mainly in Texas, along major streams in the Blackland Prairies and the Grand Prairie; possibly in Oklahoma (MLRA 86 A and B, and MLRA 85).  The series is of large extent.
