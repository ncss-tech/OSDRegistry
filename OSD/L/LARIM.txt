LARIM SERIES

The Larim series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium generated during the late Pleistocene. They are on relict terraces, escarpment caps, and remnant pediment toeslopes. Slopes are typically 2 to 15 percent but range from 0 to 35 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 305 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Calciargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Larim very gravelly sandy loam-rangeland on a SW facing terrace with slope of 3 percent. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A--0 to 8 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; 35 percent rounded gravel; slightly effervescent, finely disseminated carbonates; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 15 cm thick)

     Bt--8 to 20 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; thin continuous clay films on all faces of peds; common fine, very fine, and medium roots; 50 percent rounded gravel; noneffervescent; neutral; clear wavy boundary. (0 to 25 cm thick)

     Btk--20 to 38 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; thin common clay films on faces of peds, carbonates masking some clay films on vertical faces of peds; common fine, very fine, and medium roots; 50 percent rounded gravel; strongly effervescent, few fine and medium soft masses of lime; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (8 to 30 cm thick)

     2Bk--38 to 86 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly loamy sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; single grained except where weakly cemented by carbonates; slightly hard, very friable, few very fine, fine, and medium roots; 50 percent rounded gravel; violently effervescent, many fine and medium soft masses and weak pendants of lime; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. (38 to 64 cm thick) 

     2C--86 to 152 cm; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) very gravelly loamy sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; single grained; slightly hard, very friable; 50 percent rounded gravel; strongly effervescent, finely disseminated carbonates; moderately alkaline.
