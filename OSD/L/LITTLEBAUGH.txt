LITTLEBAUGH SERIES

The Littlebaugh series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in colluvium over residuum derived from granite. The Littlebaugh soils are on structural benches, glacial-valley walls, and mountain slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1070 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, isotic, mesic Vitrandic Humixerepts

 R--92 cm; Very strongly cemented granite bedrock, fractured at intervals of 45 to <100 cm; common fine roots in cracks.

TYPE LOCATION: Tulare County, California, near Suwanee Creek;  USGS 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle: Giant Forest, California;  WGS84 36.602830 latitude and -118.796771 longitude;  UTM zone 11 4052317 meters N 339295 meters E NAD83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil temperature: The mean annual soil temperature at 50 cm is 6 to 14 degrees C and the difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is greater than 6 degrees C. The soils have a mesic temperature regime.

Soil moisture: The soils have a xeric soil moisture regime. The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from about July to October (about 120 days).

Diagnostic Feature(s):
  Umbric epipedon thickness:  25 to 50 cm
  Depth to lithic contact:  50 to 100 cm

Organic matter: 1 to 5 percent in the epipedon

Reaction: strongly to slightly acid

Base saturation: less than 50 percent (by ammonium acetate)

Acid-oxalate extractable Al plus 1/2 Fe:  0.4 to 1.0 percent (by weight) to a depth of 100 cm or to bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Canyonview and Grandmound (MLRA 2) soils. The Canyonview soils are on convex backslopes of mountain slopes and do not contain a lithic contact. The Grandmound soils formed in glacial outwash, do not contain fragments larger than cobbles, and are dry for less than 90 consecutive days in the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Littlebaugh soils are on convex backslopes and footslopes of mountain slopes, glacial valley walls, and structural benches. Slopes range from 15 to 90 percent. These soils formed in colluvium over residuum derived from granite. Elevation is 1210 to 2590 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 660 to 1170 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 7 to 13 degrees C. The frost-free season is 105 to 200 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Canyonview, Gratwell, and Skellog soils. The Canyonview soils are on convex backslopes of mountain slopes and do not have a lithic contact. The Gratwell soils are on broadly concave backslopes of mountain slopes and are coarse-loamy. The Skellog soils are on linear backslopes of mountain slopes and do not have a lithic contact.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained, high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Vegetation is canyon live oak, black oak, whiteleaf manzanita, incense cedar, white fir, and mountain misery.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. These soils are of limited extent.
