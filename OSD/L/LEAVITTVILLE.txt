LEAVITTVILLE SERIES

The Leavittville series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits over alluvium.  These soils occur on alluvial fans. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Pachic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Leavittville loam, grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated).

    A1--0 to 11 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) loam, very dark brown (7.5YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure that parts to moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (8 to 12 inches thick)

    A2--11 to 22 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) silt loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine prismatic structure that parts to moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable; few thin patchy clay films on some vertical faces of peds; 5 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); gradual wavy boundary. (8 to 18 inches thick)

    Bk--22 to 28 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) silt loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable; common secondary calcium carbonate visible in concretions and in thin seams and threads; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); gradual wavy boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick)

    2BCk--28 to 60 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) very gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; massive; hard, very friable; common secondary calcium carbonate visible in concretions and thin seams and threads, and common calcium carbonate coatings on gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3).

TYPE LOCATION: Lincoln County, Wyoming; 100 feet north and 800 feet east of the southwest corner of sec. 27, T. 32N, R. 119W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Thickness of the mollic epipedon: 16 inches or more
Organic carbon content in mollic epipedon: 0.8 and 2 percent and decreases regularly as depth increases

Depth to lithologic discontinuity - 20 to 40 inches
Base saturation: 90 to 100 percent

Control section (weighted average):
18 to 35 percent clay
