LOU SERIES

The Lou series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum from granite grus of pre-Cambrian age. These gently sloping soils are on shoulders and summits of ridges and hills. Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 19 degrees C (66 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in).

Voca soils: have greater than 35 percent clay in the control section and are on undulating plains and footslopes of ridges and hills

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderate. Runoff is medium on 1 to 5 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for rangeland. Some areas are used for wildlife land and improved pastures. The potential plant community is an open savannah of post oak, blackjack oak, and live oak with mid and tall grasses in thin stands. The dominant grass is little bluestem.  Other grasses include sideoats grama, yellow Indiangrass, sandhill lovegrass, Arizona cottontop, fringeleaf paspalum, pinhole bluestem, vine mesquite and purpletop tridens. The dominant forbs include orange zexmenia, sagewort, snoutbean, and heath aster. The woody plants include post oak, blackjack oak and live oak. Continued heavy use causes further deterioration and plants such as mesquite, whitebrush, yucca, Ashe juniper, gummy lovegrass, Texas grama, prairie coneflower, and basin sneezeweed, invade or increase on the ecological site.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Texas; Southwest Plateaus and Plains Range and Cotton Region, LRR-I; MLRA 82A-Texas Central Basin. This series is of large extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Llano County, Texas; 1984. Lou is a coined name.

REMARKS: This soil was formerly included with the Voca or Click series.

The Lou series was previously considered to have a paralithic contact within 102 cm (40 in). The series concept has been changed to very deep with no bedrock based on observations and descriptions.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 30 cm (0 to 12 in) (A1 and A2 horizons)
Argillic horizon: 30 to 191 cm (12 to 75 in) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and BCt horizons)
