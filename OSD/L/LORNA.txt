LORNA SERIES

The Lorna series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium over residuum derived from sandstone, siltstone or mudstone. Lorna soils are on back slopes and foot slopes of structural benches along remnant mesas. Slopes range from 8 to 35 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lorna soils are on structural benches, along remnant mesas and old terraces. The soil formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from sandstone, mudstone or siltstone. Slopes range from 8 to 35 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,300 to 6,800 feet. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches occurring as summer thunderstorms and as winter rain and snow. Mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F., the mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches, and the average frost-free period ranges from 120 to 180 days.
