LUMBERTON SERIES

The Lumberton series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in loess and the underlying loamy outwash over residuum from limestone. These soils are on strath terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Typic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Lumberton silt loam, on a 1 percent slope in a meadow. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Bt1--23 to 36 cm (9 to 14 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) silt loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; few faint brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; common faint brown (10YR 4/3) organic coatings on faces of peds; 2 percent gravel; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. [10 to 25 cm (4 to 10 inches) thick]

 2Bt3--66 to 81 cm (26 to 32 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots; many faint brown (10YR 4/3) clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent gravel; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the 2Bt horizon is 41 to 79 cm (16 to 31 inches).]

 2BC--81 to 96 cm (32 to 38 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; few distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent limestone pararock fragments; slightly effervescent, neutral; diffuse wavy boundary. [13 to 30 cm (5 to 12 inches) thick]

 3C--96 to 137 cm (38 to 54 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) and pale brown (10YR 6/3) very channery fine sandy loam; massive; friable; common faint dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) masses of iron accumulations throughout; 55 percent channers; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear irregular boundary. [30 to 61 cm (12 to 24 inches) thick]

 3R--137 to 147 cm (54 to 58 inches); brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) limestone bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Amanda, Belmont, Belmore, Caprell, Chili, Cliftycreek, Conestoga, Crouse, Gallman, Greybrook, Hickory, High Gap, Hollinger, Kanawha, Kidder, Kosciusko, LeRoy, Martinsville, Military, Mocksville, Ockley, Pignut, Princeton, Relay, Richardville, Riddles, Senachwine, Skelton, Strawn, Wawaka, Wawasee, and Woodbine series. Amanda, Belmore, Caprell, Chili, Cliftycreek, Conestoga, Crouse, Gallman, Greybrook, Hickory, Hollinger, Kanawha, Kidder, Kosciusko, LeRoy, Martinsville, Mocksville, Ockley, Princeton, Richardville, Riddles, Senachwine, Skelton, Strawn, Wawaka, and Wawasee soils do not have a lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Belmont soils have hue redder than 10YR in the lower part of the series control section. High Gap, Military, and Pignut soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Relay soils have rock fragments of gabbro, metagabbro, and granodiorite lithology. Woodbine soils do not have sandy loam or fine sandy loam textures in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Lumberton soils are on strath terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. The soils formed in loess and the underlying loamy outwash over residuum weathered from limestone. Limestone is at a depth of 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches), and in places the depth is quite variable within short distances. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 838 to 1016 mm (33 to 40 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 11 to 13 degrees C (51 to 55 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Millsdale, Randolph and Ritchey soils. The very poorly drained Millsdale and somewhat poorly drained Randolph soils are in lower topographic positions and are moderately deep. The well drained Ritchey soils are on similar landscape positions and are shallow.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The potential for surface runoff is low to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used as cropland. Principal crops are corn, soybeans and hay. Steeper areas are in woodland.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwestern Ohio; MLRA 111D. The series is of small extent.
