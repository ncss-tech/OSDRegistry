LIEBERMAN SERIES

The Lieberman series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sources.  Lieberman soils are on lake terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lieberman soils are on lake terraces.  These soils formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sources.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,000 to 4,050 feet.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches, the mean annual temperature is 49 to 52 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Epot and Herlong soils.  Epot soils are fine-silty and have natric horizons.  Herlong soils are shallow to lithic contacts on indurated tufa.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium surface runoff; moderately slow permeability in the upper part over rapid permeability in the strongly contrasting lower part.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Lieberman soils are used for rangeland.  The vegetation is mainly shadscale, bud sagebrush, and spiny hopsage.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern California.  These soils are not extensive with about 3,900 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 27.
