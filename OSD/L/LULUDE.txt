LULUDE SERIES 

The Lulude series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from basic extrusive rocks, tuff, and breccia, with accompanying volcanic ash and cinders.  Lulude soils are on hills, ridges, mesa summits, and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 4 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lulude soils are on hills, ridges, mesa tops, and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 4 to 60 percent.  The soil formed in material weathered from basic extrusive rocks, tuff, and breccia, with accompanying volcanic ash and cinders.  Elevation ranges from 9,000 to 11,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 34 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer.  Mean annual temperature is 32 to 38 degrees F and mean summer temperature is about 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 25 to 60 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Larand soils and the Peeler soils.  Larand soils do not have a lithic contact above 40 inches.  Peeler soils have fine-loamy control sections and do not have a lithic contact above a depth of 40 inches. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used as grazing land and for timber production.  Native vegetation consists of lodgepole pine, spruce, fir, elk sedge, juniper, and wild rose. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mountainous areas of Colorado.  MLRA 48A.  The series is of small extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Jackson County, Colorado, 1973. 

REMARKS:  This revision adds the superactive clay activity class to the classification.  This is based on the general pattern indicated by lab data for western Colorado.

This series could be in both the Typic and Ochreptic subgroups based on the given range in thickness of the argillic horizon (5 to 22 inches).  The classification will provisionaly remain as Typic pending a proposed change in the Alfisols to exclude moderately deep soils such as Lulude from the concept of the Ochreptic subgroup.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon: from 3 to 17 inches (A and E horizons)
Argillic horizon: from 25 to 33 inches (Bt horizon)
Particle-size control section: the zone from 25 to 33 inches (the entire argillic horizon)
Lithic contact: at 33 inches.

Keys to Soil Taxonomy:  Classified according to the Seventh Edition, 1996.
