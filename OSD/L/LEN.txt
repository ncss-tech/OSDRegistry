LEN SERIES

The Len series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on dissected alluvial fans and stream terraces.  Slopes are 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey over loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Len cobbly loam, rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated).

    A--0 to 3 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) cobbly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very thin platy structure parting to moderate very fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; 10 percent cobbles and 10 percent pebbles; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (2 to 6 inches)

    Bt1--3 to 7 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong medium and fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent pebbles; neutral; gradual smooth boundary. (3 to 8 inches thick)

    Bt2--7 to 17 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium and fine subangular blocky; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; continuous distinct dark brown (10YR3/3) moist clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent pebbles; neutral; gradual smooth boundary. (6 to 15 inches thick)

    2Btk--17 to 22 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 40 percent pebbles and 10 percent cobbles; common fine masses of lime; continuous faint coatings of lime on fragments and continuous faint casts on underside of fragments; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 5 inches thick)

    2Bk1--22 to 40 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 50 percent pebbles and 15 percent cobbles; common fine seams and masses of lime; continuous faint lime casts on undersides of fragments; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (6 to 20 inches thick)

    2Bk2--40 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; 50 percent pebbles and 10 percent cobbles; disseminated lime; continuous faint lime casts on underside of fragments; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Len soils are used mainly for range.  Some are used for irrigated crops of hay and pasture.  Potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, rough fescue, Sandberg bluegrass, sagebrush, and arrowleaf balsamroot.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Len series are of minor extent.  They are in mountain valleys in central Montana.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Type location moved to Lewis and Clark County, Montana and established by the correlation of Lewis and Clark County Area, Montana, 1991.  Series proposed in Granite County Area, Montana, 1967.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT0560.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches (A, Bt1 horizons); an argillic horizon from 3 to 22 inches (Bt1, Bt2, 2Btk horizons); and a discontinuity from 22 to 60 inches (2Bk1, 2Bk2 horizons).  Len soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
