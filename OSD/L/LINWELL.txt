LINWELL SERIES

The Linwell series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium or colluvium.  These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans, hills, escarpments and plains.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Entic Haplustolls
