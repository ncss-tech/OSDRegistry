COMPETING SERIES: This is the Faddin series. Similar soils are the Bernard, Morey, and Viterbo series. 
Faddin soils: has a fine sandy loam surface; located in areas with less rainfall
Bernard soils: have chroma of 3 or more in the lower part of the solum; located in areas with less rainfall
Morey soils: have a fine-silty particle-size control section
Viterbo soils:  have an ochric epipedon

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loamy fluviomarine deposits derived from the Beaumont Formation of Pleistocene age
Landscape: flat coastal plains
Landform: flats
Slope: 0 to 1 percent
Mean annual air temperature range: 20.0 to 22.2 degrees C (68 to 72 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation range: 1219 to 1575 mm (48 to 62 in)
Precipitation Pattern: Rainfall is fairly uniform throughout the year with slight peaks in the fall and spring months. 
Frost-free period: 270 to 300 days
Elevation: 3 to 30.5 m (10 to 100 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aris, Anahuac, Levac, Orcadia, Meaton, Morey, Mocarey, and the Spindletop series. 

Aris soils: are gray throughout due to wetness; are on flats
Anahuac and Orcadia soils: are on a broader landform
Levac soils: somewhat poorly drained; are truncated pimple mounds 
Mocarey soils:  in a fine-loamy family similar landform
Meaton and Morey soils: in a fine-silty family; similar landform
Spindletop soils: are in a fine family; are on pimple mounds

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: somewhat poorly drained. Runoff is high. Rarey flooded for very brief to brief periods. Flooding occurs as a result of storm surge during tropical storms which occurs in areas less than 4.6 m (15 ft) elevation. These soils have episaturation from 20 to 100 cm (8 to 40 in) below the soil surface from January to March and endosaturation from 150 to 203 cm (60 to 80 in) below the surface during the same period.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for cropland and pasture.  Cropland is mostly in rice production.  Pastures are bahiagrass or bermudagrass.  Native vegetation is tall prairie grasses, mainly andropogons, panicum, and paspalums. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeast Texas; Land Resource Region T; MLRA 150A; the series is of large.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Jefferson County, Texas; 1996.

REMARKS: The Labelle soils were formerly included with the Bernard and Morey series. The series was separated from the Bernard series by amount of rainfall. Morey soils are in a fine-silty family. The series description was updated during the update of MLRA 150A in 2013. The site remained the same but description was changed to one with laboratory data.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle size control section: 21 to 71 cm (8 to 28 in). (Bt and Btss1 horizon)

Mollic epipedon: 0 to 55 cm (0 to 22 in). (Ap,A, Bt horizons)
Argillic horizon: 21 to 203 cm (8 to 80 in). (Bt, Btss1, Btss2, Btkssg1, Btkssg2 horizons)

Additional Comments: The Btss1 horizon has mollic colors but fails to meet mollic epipedon criteria by having very hard consistence.

ADDITIONAL DATA: KSSL Data from type location on pedon 88TX245002. Additional data on pedons 59TX24006, S11TX0713298 and S10TX0713683.
