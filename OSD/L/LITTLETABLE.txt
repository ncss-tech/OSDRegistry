LITTLETABLE SERIES

The Littletable series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in sodium affected lacustrine deposits.  These soils occur on lakebeds.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 410 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic Ustic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Littletable silt loam, in rangeland on a 1 percent slope at an elevation of 2021 meters (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

   A--0 to 11 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine and medium granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 15 cm thick)

   E--11 to 20 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium and thick platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (4 to 15 cm thick)

   Btn--20 to 33 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; strong fine and medium columnar structure; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 60 percent prominent continuous clay films on all faces of peds; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.4); gradual wavy boundary. (12 to 35 cm thick)

   Btkn--33 to 59 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) silty clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; 5 percent faint patchy clay films on all faces of peds; finely disseminated calcium carbonate and 5 percent fine, distinct, irregular soft masses of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 30 cm thick)

   C--59 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; common, medium, distinct, brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) mottles; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8).
