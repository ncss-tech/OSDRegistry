LANDERMEYER SERIES

The Landermeyer series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks influenced by vitric pyroclastic materials. Landermeyer soils are on entrenched floodplains and narrow mountain drainageways. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TYPE LOCATION: Lander County, Nevada; about 32 miles southwest of Battle Mountain; about 900 feet east and 2,550 feet south of the northwest corner of Section 7, T. 27 N., R. 42 E.; USGS Fish Creek Basin 7.5minute topographic quadrangle; latitude: 40 degrees 13 minutes 35 seconds north and longitude: 117 degrees 17 minutes 32.00 seconds west; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.2263889 latitude, -117.2922222 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Landermeyer soils are moist in the winter and spring, dry summer and fall; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 35 to over 100 cm, organic matter decreases irregularly with depth.
Profile reaction: Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.
Other features: The parent material typically has a large amount of vitric pyroclastic material such as volcanic ash. Buried A horizons are common. Some pedons have gravelly strata or strata of ashy silty clay loam, ashy silt loam, clay, ashy loam, ashy very fine sandy loam, or ashy sandy loam.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 18 to 27 percent.

A and AC horizons
Hue: 10YR through 5Y.
Value: 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3.
Relict redoximorphic features: Few to many, fine or medium, distinct or prominent zones of iron or manganese accumulation either lining pores or as masses within the matrix. 
Volcanic glass: Volcanic glass is estimated to range from 20 to 30 percent of the 0.2 to 2 mm fraction

C horizons
Hue: 10YR through 5Y.
Value: 5 through 8 dry, 2 through 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3.
Texture: Averages silt loam, loam or fine sandy loam, may be modified by ash.
Consistence: Slightly hard or hard dry, very friable or friable moist. Slightly sticky or moderately sticky and slightly plastic or moderately plastic.
Relict redoximorphic features: None too many, fine to coarse zones of iron or manganese accumulation either lining pores or as masses within the matrix. 
Volcanic glass: Volcanic glass is estimated to range from 20 to 30 percent of the 0.2 to 2 mm fraction
Other features: Some pedons have horizons below 100 cm that are very gravelly loamy sand to extremely gravelly coarse sand.

COMPETING SERIES: These are Buckbert and Redmond soils.

Buckbert and Redmond soils have a mollic epipedon less than 41 cm. Redmond soils have bedrock at 40 to 100 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Landermeyer soils occur on floodplains adjacent to areas of deep stream channel entrenchment or are on entrenched narrow mountain drainageways. They formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks and influenced by vitric pyroclastic materials (glassy volcanic ash). Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,432 to 1,964 meters. The climate is cool-semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kelk, Pinval and Wendane soils. Kelk, Pinval and Wendane soils have ochric epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. These soils have flooding frequency ranging from non-flooded to rarely flooded.  

USE AND VEGETATION: Landermeyer soils are used for hay production, rangeland, and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly basin big sagebrush and basin wildrye.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Nevada. MLRA 24, 28B.  Small extant.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: SDJR projects Lander County, Nevada. 2015

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 61 cm (A1, A2, A3 and AC horizons).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (A3, AC, C and part of the 2C horizon).

ADDITIONAL DATA: Historic stream channel entrenchment has lowered the zone of saturation on the floodplains these soils occur on.  The accelerated entrenchment and drainage on some of these floodplains is not considered to be artificial.
