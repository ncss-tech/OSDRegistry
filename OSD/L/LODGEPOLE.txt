LODGEPOLE SERIES

The Lodgepole series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loess and loamy sediments in upland depressions and playas. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: upland
Landform:  depressions and playas
Slopes: 0 to 1 percent
Parent material: loess and loamy sediments 
Precipitation: 36 to 46 centimeters (14 to 18 inches)
Mean annual air temperature: 8 to 12 degrees C. (47 to 54 degrees F.)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Alliance, Duroc, Goshen, Keith, Kuma, Rago, Rosebud and Satanta soils 
Alliance, Duroc, Goshen, Keith, and Kuma soils are fine-silty.  
Alliance and Keith soils have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick. 
Kuma and Rago soils have a buried paleosol in the series control section.
Richfield soils have a mollic epipedon less than 51 centimeters (20 inches) thick. 
Rosebud and Satanta soils are fine-loamy. 
Rosebud soils have sandstone at depths between 20 and 40 inches.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage: somewhat poorly  
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: low
Runoff: very low or ponded
The surface layer is saturated for periods of long duration during March to July from a perched water table that ranges from +0.5 to 2.0 feet.
These soils typically pond water for short duration.
A ponded phase is recognized that ponds water for long duration in more than one-half the years.
The water table in the ponded phase ranges from +2.0 to 2.0 feet.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of the acreage is cultivated. 
Successful crop production depends upon the timeliness of precipitation and the length of time the soil is ponded.
Winter wheat is the main dryland crop.
Corn, alfalfa, and field beans are the main irrigated crops.
The ponded phase is mostly in native grass or weeds.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Nebraska and possibly eastern Wyoming, northeastern Colorado, southwestern South Dakota and northwestern Kansas. The series is of small extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Salina, Kansas 


SERIES ESTABLISHED: Banner County, Nebraska; 1989.
REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 114 centimeters (45 inches) (the Ap, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 and Bt4 horizons) 
Argillic horizon:  13 to 114 centimeters (5 to 45 inches) (the Bt horizons)
Aquic soil conditions/redox features: 23 to 97 centimeters (9 to 38 inches) 
The Lodgepole soils need to be re-examined for possible inclusion in the "Vertic" subgroup.  Lodgepole soils were previously mapped as variants of the Scott series. They are in a drier climate and typically pond for shorter duration than the Scott soils mapped in eastern and central Nebraska. The ponded phase is similar to the Scott soils but the profile classifies the same as Lodgepole. The ponded phase needs additional study to determine if a new series is needed. 

Modified format by LRM in 10/2005 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.

11/2021 PTC: Added wetland vegetation for Nebraska to ADDITIONAL DATA. Updated SSRO statement. Added Thickness to Range in Characteristics.

ADDITIONAL DATA:
In Nebraska, the native vegetative cover is an herbaceous wetland community commonly inhabited with: shortbeak sedge (Carex brevior (Dewey) Mack.), woolly sedge (Carex pellita), ticklegrass(Agrostis hyemalis), bald spikerush (Eleocharis erythropoda), western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii), and rice cutgrass (Leersia oryzoides). Plains coreopsis (Coreopsis tinctoria), western water clover, (Marsilea vestita), smartweeds (Persicaria spp.), docks (Rumex spp.), and prairie ironweed (Vernonia fasciculata).
