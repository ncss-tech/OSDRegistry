Alterationcreek soils are well drained, have bedrock at a depth between 101 and 154 cm (40 and 61 in), and occur on hillslopes and mountain valleys.
Haggardcreek soils are well drained, has a folistic epipedon, there soils are bedrock within 2 meters of the soil surface, and occur on hillslopes and mountain slopes.
Haleycreek soils are well drained, have a mollic epipedon, lacks a lithic contact, and occur on hillslopes of mountains and river valleys.
Hundell soils are moderately well drained, lack a histic epipedon, and occur on flats and bluffs in till plains and outwash plains.
