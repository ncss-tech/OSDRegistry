LEWNOT SERIES

The Lewnot series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on stream terraces.  They formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquic Haploxerepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lewnot fine sandy loam, hayland - on a 1 percent smooth slope at 4,470 feet elevation.  (Color is for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on October 9, 1992 the soil was dry to 7 inches and moist below.

    Ap1--0 to 3 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak thin platy structure parting to moderate fine granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine irregular and tubular pores; strongly effervescent, disseminated lime (5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); abrupt smooth boundary.

    Ap2--3 to 10 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate thick platy structure parting to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; strongly effervescent, disseminated lime (5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); clear smooth boundary.

    Bw1--10 to 14 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent, disseminated lime (5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary.

    Bw2--14 to 20 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine and few fine tubular pores; common fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation; strongly effervescent, disseminated lime (10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary.

    C1--20 to 38 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) very fine sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine and few fine tubular pores; few fine faint light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) masses of iron depletion and few fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) masses of iron accumulation; strongly effervescent, disseminated lime (10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt wavy boundary.

    2C2--38 to 61 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly loamy sand, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; single grain; loose; few very fine roots; common very fine and few fine irregular pores; slightly effervescent, disseminated lime (2 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); 45 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lewnot soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 4,400 to 5,100 feet.  The soil formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 16 inches.  The average annual air temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  The frost free period is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cachecan (T), Oxford, and Parleys series.  Cachecan soils are on low stream terraces.  Oxford soils are on steep side slopes adjacent to Lewnot soils.  Parleys soils are on stream terrace.  Cachecan soils are moderately well drained and have a cambic horizon.  Oxford soils have a fine particle-size control section.  Parleys soils are well drained and are fine-silty.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; low runoff; moderate permeability in the upper part and rapid permeability in the lower part; occasional flooding for brief periods January through June.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Lewnot soils are used for hayland and pastureland.  In Idaho it is correlated with Semiwet Meadow ecological sites.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho.  This series is not extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Franklin County, Idaho, 1997.  The name is coined.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to 10 inches (Ap1 and Ap2 horizons)

Cambic horizon - the zone from 10 to 20 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)

Particle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (the Bw1, Bw2, C1 and 2C2 horizons)

The classification is based on the "Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eighth Edition, 1998".  Superactive cation exchange activity class is an estimate based on the NASIS interpretive record soil properties.
