LAP SERIES

The Lap series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from limestone.  These soils are on bedrock-floored plains, escarpments, structural benches, hills, and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, frigid Lithic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lap channery loam, grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 4 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) channery loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; 35 percent channers (flat 1 to 4 inch diameter limestone fragments); slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 9 inches thick)

    Bk1--4 to 12 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very channery loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; 50 percent channers; disseminated lime, continuous prominent lime casts on underside of channers; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 8 inches thick)

    Bk2--12 to 19 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) extremely channery loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; 65 percent channers; disseminated lime; continuous prominent lime casts on underside of channers; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual irregular boundary. (4 to 11 inches thick)

    R--19 inches; hard limestone bedrock with some cracks.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Lap soils are used mainly as rangeland, some of the soils are used for dryland crops where they occur with other kinds of soils.  Potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, rough fescue, Idaho fescue, needleandthread, western wheatgrass, forbs, and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Lap soils are extensive in the foothills and mountains of central and southwest Montana.  MLRAs 43B, 44B, 46.
