LINROSE SERIES

The Linrose series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from shale, chert, and quartzite.  Linrose soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcidic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Linrose cobbly loam--on a southwest-facing slope of 45 percent under black sagebrush and Idaho fescue at about 2,380 meters elevation--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is partially covered with 30 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles.

    A1--0 to 5 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) cobbly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate very thin platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine vesicular and few very fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 1 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 13 cm thick)

    A2--5 to 20 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak very thin platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 25 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 28 cm thick)

    Bk1--20 to 41 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 45 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; secondary carbonates segregated as few coats on bottoms of rock fragments; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6) clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 50 cm thick)

    Bk2--41 to 66 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 45 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent; secondary carbonates segregated as few coats on bottoms of rock fragments; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (20 to 50 cm thick)

    R--66 cm; unweathered, fractured chert.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lander County, Nevada about 9 miles west of Battle Mountain and southwest of the summit of Long Peak; approximately 1,000 feet north and 1,500 feet east of the southwest corner of section 26, T. 32 N., R. 43 E.; USGS Galena Canyon 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 36 minutes 46 seconds north and longitude 117 degrees 06 minutes 19 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.6127778 latitude, -117.1052778 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually moist in winter and spring, dry July through October; aridic soil moisture regime that borders on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 18 to 38 cm.
Depth to horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates: 18 to 38 cm.
Depth to bedrock: 50 to 100 cm to a lithic contact.
Reaction: Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  Averages 18 to 27 percent. Rock fragments:  Averages 35 to 60 percent, mainly gravel.  Lithology of fragments is chert or quartzite.

A horizons
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3, dry or moist.
Organic matter content: 1 or 2 percent.

Bk horizons
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4 dry, 2 through 4 moist.
Texture:  Very gravelly loam and very gravelly sandy loam.
Structure: Moderate fine subangular blocky or massive.
Consistence: Very friable or friable, moist; slightly sticky or moderately sticky and slightly plastic or moderately plastic, wet.
Effervescence:  Matrix is noneffervescent or slightly effervescent.
Identifiable secondary carbonates: Occurs as coats on bottoms of rock fragments.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 3 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Breitenbach, Darlington, Pandoah, and Rito series.

Breitenbach, Darlington, and Rito soils are very deep.  Pandoah soils have hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR and are dominated by channers and flagstones.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Linrose soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions with north and east-facing aspects.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from shale, argillite, chert, and quartzite.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,680 to 2,445 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 350 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 60 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cleavage, Slaven, and Sumine soils.  Cleavage soils have argillic horizons and are shallow to lithic contacts.  Slaven and Sumine soils have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Linrose soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly black sagebrush, Idaho fescue, Cusick's bluegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, and tapertip hawksbeard.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 24.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Pershing County (East Part), Nevada, 1986.

REMARKS:  A revision in July 2003 updated the taxonomic class from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Haploxerolls.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 20 cm (A1 and A2 horizons).
Identifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 20 to 66 cm (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons).
Lithic contact - The boundary at 66 cm to underlying hard, unweathered bedrock (R layer).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 66 cm (Bk2 horizon and part of the Bk1 horizon).
