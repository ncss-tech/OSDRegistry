LAS LUCAS SERIES

The Las Lucas series consists of deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed from gray and olive shale on alluvial fans and valley fill side slopes. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, active, mesic Ustic Haplocambids 

TYPICAL PEDON: Las Lucas clay loam

     A--0 to 8 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium platy structure in the upper 1 or 2 inches, moderate fine granular structure in the lower part; slightly hard, friable; abundant roots; weakly calcareous in upper 4 inches becoming strongly calcareous in lower part; clear boundary.  5 to 10 inches thick.

     Bw--8 to 15 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) heavy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; roots are common; very strongly calcareous; clear irregular boundary.  5 to 9 inches thick.

     Bk--15 to 22 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak angular and subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm; very strongly calcareous; this is a weak Bk horizon with a few small calcium carbonate concretions; gradual boundary.  5 to 10 inches thick.

     Ck--22 to 40 inches; pale olive (5Y 6/3) light clay loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; massive; hard, friable; strongly calcareous; this is a weak Ck horizon with a few small calcium carbonate concretions and thin seams; gradual boundary.  8 to 14 inches thick.

     R--40 to 50 inches +; Gray and olive shale, laminated and with common salt crystals between the laminations.

TYPE LOCATION: Sandoval County, New Mexico, 20 feet NE of SW corner of section 16, T19N, R2W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Depth to shale bedrock: greater than 40 inches

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nearly level to sloping alluvial fans and valley filling slopes.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow permeability; runoff is rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION: Western wheatgrass, alkali sacaton, blue grama and galleta.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED: The Upper Puerco Reconn. Survey, SCS, 1937.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric Epipedon - The zone from the surface to a depth of 8 inches. (A horizon)

Cambic horizon - The zone from 8 to 15 inches. (Bw horizon)

Classified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999.

Series name after a small village in Bernalillo County, New Mexico.  Soil at type location differs from typical profile for series description by having a light clay texture at 8 to 15 inches and having slightly coarser structure throughout the horizon.
