LIPPINCOTT SERIES

The Lippincott series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that are deep to calcareous sandy and gravelly outwash. They formed in outwash dominantly of limestone origin on outwash plains and terraces. In some places, the upper part of the solum formed in silty or loamy alluvium or in loess as much as 46 cm (18 inches) thick. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Calamine, Grannycreek (T), Kokomo, and Tanglenook series. Calamine and Kokomo soils do not have as much as 35 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Tanglenook soils have a mollic epipedon that is more than 51 cm (20 inches) thick. No OSD on file for Grannycreek series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lippincott soils are on outwash plains and terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in outwash high in limestone gravel and sand, and in some places a layer of silty or loamy alluvium or loess as much as 1(46 cm (8 inches) thick. These soils have loose, calcareous sandy and gravelly outwash at a depth of 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches). Climate is humid and temperate. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 864 to 1118 mm (34 to 44 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 11 to 13 degrees C (51 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 160 days. Elevation is 299 to 366 meters (980 to 1200 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Eldean and Savona soils in a toposequence with the Lippincott soils, and the Kane, Ockley, Sleeth, Thackery, Warsaw, and Westland soils. The well drained Eldean soils and the somewhat poorly drained Savona soils are on higher topographic positions. The somewhat poorly drained Kane soils and the well drained Warsaw soils have loose sand and gravel within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches) and are nearby. Ockley, Sleeth, Thackery, and Westland soils formed in similar materials but are fine-loamy. In addition, Ockley, Sleeth, and Thackery soils have an ochric epipedon and are on higher topographic positions. Westland soils are on similar topographic positions as Lippincott soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 30 cm (1.0 foot) above the surface to 15 cm (0.5 foot) below the surface during the winter and spring in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and very high in the substratum. Permeability is moderate or moderately slow in the solum and rapid or very rapid in the substratum. 

USE AND VEGETATION: A large proportion has been cleared and is under cultivation. Principal crops include corn, soybeans, wheat, and hay or forage crops. Native vegetation is deciduous swamp forests.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central and western Ohio; MLRA 111A. The series is of moderate extent, about 25,000 acres.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Champaign County, Ohio, 1969.

REMARKS: The Lippincott soils were formerly classified in the clayey over sandy or sandy-skeletal family. Some field studies and data indicate that the Lippincott soils do not have a contrasting particle-size control section. Further investigation is needed during MLRA updating activities.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon: from the surface to 41 cm (Ap, A, Bt horizon).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 30 to 69 cm (Bt, Btg horizon).
Aquic conditions: redox features in the lower part of the mollic epipedon and in all underlying horizons.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data are available for CH-32, CH-36 (the typical pedon), and DK-27 from the Soil Characterization Laboratory at The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.
