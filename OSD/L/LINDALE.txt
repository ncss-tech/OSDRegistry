LINDALE SERIES

The Lindale series consists of moderately deep, well drained,
slowly permeable soils that formed in marine clays and limestone rubble.  These gently sloping soils are on stream divides or low ridges.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, thermic Typic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lindale clay loam--pasture.
       (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A1--0 to 6 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure;
very hard, firm; many fine and medium roots; common medium pores; common wormcasts; common fine fragments of ironstone; slightly
acid; clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 9 inches thick)

     B21t--6 to 16 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) clay, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky
structure; very hard, firm; common fine and medium roots; few
patchy clay films; common fine fragments of ironstone; mildly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (5 to 18 inches thick)

     B22t--16 to 25 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay, brown (7.5YR
4/4) moist; moderate medium blocky structure; extremely hard, very firm; few fine roots; few patchy clay films; about 10 percent fine subrounded fragments of ironstone; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (4 to 20 inches thick)

     B3ca--25 to 32 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay, brown (10YR
4/3) moist; common fine distinct mottles of strong brown (7.5YR
5/6); moderate medium blocky structure; extremely hard, very firm; few fine roots; about 2 percent fine fragments of ironstone; about
3 percent fine, soft masses and concretions of calcium carbonate; moderately alkaline; strong effervescence; clear wavy boundary.
(4 to 14 inches thick)

     C1ca--32 to 43 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very gravelly clay, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; extremely hard, very firm; few fine roots; about 60 percent by volume of limestone gravel, cobbles, and stones; about 10 percent soft masses of calcium carbonate; few fine fragments of ironstone, moderately alkaline; strong effervescence; diffuse boundary.  (6 to 20 inches thick)

     C2ca--43 to 65 inches; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) gravelly
clay, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; massive; hard, firm; about
30 percent soft masses of calcium carbonate; 20 percent limestone gravel and concretions of calcium carbonate; few fragments of ironstone; moderately alkaline; strong effervescence.

TYPE LOCATION:  Denton County, Texas; from the intersection of
U.S. Highway 380 and Interstate Highway 35; 3.0 miles west on U.S.  Highway 380; then 0.3 mile north on gravel road and 100 feet east
of right-of-way into pasture.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness to C horizons
containing limestone gravel, cobbles, and stones ranges from 20 to
40 inches.  Depth to calcareous soil material ranges from 18 to 27 inches.  Volume of fragments of ironstone, in the solum, ranges
from few to 10 percent.

The A horizon is grayish brown (10YR 5/2), brown (7.5YR 4/2, 5/2, 5/4), or reddish brown (5YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/4).  A horizons with moist values and chromas of less than 3.5 are less than 7 inches thick.  The A horizon is clay loam or sandy clay loam.  Reaction ranges
from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.

The B2t horizons are brown (7.5YR 5/4), yellowish red (5YR 5/6), reddish brown (5YR 4/4, 5/4), light reddish brown (5YR 6/4), or
red (2.5YR 5/6).  Texture is clay loam or clay with a range of 35
to 50 percent clay.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid through moderately alkaline.

The B3ca horizon is yellowish brown (10YR 5/6), brown (10YR 5/3; 7.5YR 5/4), strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), or reddish brown (5YR 5/4).  Contrasting mottles of strong brown or reddish brown range from
none to common. Texture is clay loam, clay, silty clay, or silty
clay loam.  Concretions, soft masses of calcium carbonate, and fragments of limestone range from few to 50 percent by volume.

The Cca horizons are yellowish brown (10YR 5/6), strong brown
(7.5YR 5/6), brown (7.5YR 5/4; 10YR 5/3), light brown (7.5YR 6/4),
or reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6).  The fine earth fraction of the
C1ca horizon is silty clay, clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam.
The volume of fragments of limestone ranges from 45 to 80 percent.  It contains 35 to 50 percent fragments of gravel, 10 to 20 percent fragments of cobble, and up to 10 percent fragments of flat
limestone 3 to 5 feet long, 2 to 3 feet wide, and 1 to 6 inches thick.  Cobble and stone content is variable within short
distances.  Soft masses of calcium carbonate range from few to 35 percent by volume.  The fine earth fraction of the C2ca horizon is silty clay or clay.  It contains 10 to 30 percent limestone gravel and cobbles and 15 to 40 percent soft masses of calcium carbonate.

COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Bexar, Callahan, Fulshear, Hillco, Lindy, Mingo, and Thurber series.  Bexar soils have 15 to
35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Callahan
soils have a paralithic contact with shale at 24 to 40 inches
depth.  In addition, Callahan soils are dry in the moisture
control section for longer periods.  Fulshear soils have thicker
sola and lack carbonates within 28 inches of the surface.  Hillco
and Mingo soils have a mollic epipedon.  Lindy soils lack
secondary carbonates within 28 inches of the soil surface and have
a lithic contact to limestone.  Thurber soils have
montmorillonitic mineralogy.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lindale soils are on gently sloping uplands.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent but are mostly 1 to 3 percent.
The soil formed in marine clays and limestone rubble of Lower Cretaceous formations.  The climate is warm subhumid.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 38 inches; mean annual temperature
is 62 degrees to 69 degrees F; Thornthwaite P-E indices are 46 to
62.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Mingo series, as well as the Ponder, Sanger, and Somervell series.
Ponder soils have sola more than 40 inches thick.  Sanger soils
are calcareous, lack B2t horizons, and have intersecting slickensides.  Somervell soils have a mollic epipedon, have less
than 35 percent clay in the control section and lack B2t horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for cropland, rangeland, and pastures.  Crops are mainly small grain and grain sorghum.  Native vegetation
is little bluestem, buffalograss, meadow dropseed, and Texas wintergrass.  Scattered mesquite and hackberry trees occur in some areas

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mainly along the eastern edge of Grand Prairie of northcentral Texas.  The series is moderately
extensive.

REMARKS:  These soils were formerly included in the Lindy series
and would have been formerly classified in the Reddish Prairie
great soil group.
