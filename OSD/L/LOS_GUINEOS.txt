COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in the same family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landscape: Humid Mountains and Valleys of Puerto Rico (MLRA 270)
Landform: Los Guineos soils are on mountaintops and mountainflanks of Sierra de Luquillo in El Yunque National Forest
Parent Material: They formed in highly weathered residuum from Hato Puerco lava formation. 
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 16 to 21 degrees C. (61 to 70 degrees F.).
Mean Annual Precipitation: 3,556 to 5,436 millimeters (140 to 214 inches).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
These include the Moteado, Yunque, and Zarzal soils.
Moteado soils--are deep to bedrock and have water tables and hydric soil morphology in their soil profiles.
Yunque soils--have less clay in the control section and have water tables closer to the soil surface than Los Guineos
Zarzal soils--have isohyperthermic temperature regime, udic moisture regime and occur on much steeper side slopes. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class: Well drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: Moderately high or high 

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Major uses: Watershed protection, recreation, research, agriculture and wildlife habitat.
Dominant vegetation: Most of the areas are in El Yunque National Forest and are forested.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Humid Central Mountain Range and Valley Region of Puerto Rico.
The series is of small extent. 

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Puerto Rico, 1936. 

REMARKS:
 Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon: 
1. Ochric epipedon - zone from 0 to 8 centimeters (0 to 3 inches, A and AB horizons). 
2. Oxic horizon - zone from 8 to 79 centimeters (3 to 31 inches, Bto horizons). 
3. Non-Argillic horizon - zone from 8 to 203 centimeters (3 to 80 inches, Bto, Bt, and BCt horizons). 
4. Clay illuviation evidence is present but according to Soil Taxonomy and Lab data does not meet the required characteristics for the argillic or kandic horizons. This horizon needs at least 8 percent or more (absolute) clay than above horizon if that horizon has more than 40 percent total clay in the fine-earth fraction.

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Characterization data - Caribbean National Forest, Puerto Rico. Pedon No. 86P0303 and Soil Survey No. S1986PR119010. Sample by NSSL, Lincoln NE, 1986. 
Los Guineos soils are in MLRA 270A and in the perudic moisture regime.
