COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bernaldo, Bernow, and Gallime series in the same family, and the Freestone, Keithville, Kolin, Naldo, Raino, Sawtown, Scottsville, Vesey, and Whakana series in closely related families. Bernaldo, Bernow, Gallime, Naldo, Vesey, and Whakana soils do not have a clayey discontinuity in the lower part of the subsoil. In addition, Naldo, Vesey, and Whakana soils have mixed mineralogy, and Vesey and Whakana soils do not have a saturated zone within a depth of 80 inches. Freestone, Keithville, and Scottsville soils have aquic conditions within a depth of 30 inches. Keithville, Kolin, and Sawtown soils have a fine-silty control section. Raino and Scottsville soils have a fine-loamy over clayey particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Latex soils are on very gently sloping coastal plain terraces. These soils are on low convex ridges and stream divides. Slope gradients are 1 to 3 percent. The soils formed in loamy Pliestocene age sediments over clayey Tertiary age deposits on upland terraces. Mean annual temperature is about 64 to 68 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is about 40 to 48 inches, and the Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 68 to 76. Summer moisture deficit ranges from 4 to 6 inches and frost-free precipitation ranges from 25 to 30 inches. Frost free days range from 220 to 250 and the elevation ranges from 150 to 450 feet above sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the closely related Scottsville soils, and the Bernaldo and Eastwood soils. Bernaldo soils are on lower lying terraces on smooth slopes, or on low ridges. They do not have a clayey discontinuity. Eastwood soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep stream divides or sideslopes along drainageways. They are clayey throughout the subsoil. Scottsville soils are on slightly lower positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Latex soils are moderately well drained. Permeability is moderate in the Bt horizon and slow in the 2Bt horizon. Runoff is negligible on slopes less than 1 percent, and low on slopes more than 1 percent. The soil is wet in the layers that are below a depth of 3 to 4.5 feet and above the discontinuity during the winter and spring months in normal years.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for woodland and pasture, however some areas are used for cropland. Native vegetation consists of loblolly pine, shortleaf pine, sweetgum, hickory, and other hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Coastal Plain (MLRA 133B) in eastern Texas and western Louisiana. The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Harrison County, Texas; 1984. The name is from a nearby community.

REMARKS: These soils were formerly included with the Bowie series. The series was updated in 2002 to allow moderately acid reaction in the E horizon.  The series was updated in 2004 to allow hue to range to 2.5YR in the argillic horizon above the discontinuity.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the type location pedon include:
Ochric epipedon --- 0 of 10 inches (A and E horizons).
Argillic horizon -- 10 to 74 inches (Bt, Bt/E, 2Bt/E, and 2Btg horizons).
Intrusions of albic material -- 33 to 46 inches (Bt/E and 2Bt/E horizons). 
Lithologic discontinuity -- 46 inches (top of the 2Bt/E horizon).
