LILAPOINT SERIES

The Lilapoint series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Lilapoint soils are on mountain drainageways.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 35 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 5.2 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Torrifluventic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lilapoint fine sandy loam, on a southwest facing, concave, 5 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 2,440 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on August 7, 1980 the soil was dry from 0 to 152 cm.  

    A--0 to 13 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3), moist; moderate medium and fine granular structure; very friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few coarse and common medium and fine roots; 1 percent gravel; slightly effervescent (5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are finely disseminated; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (8 to 18 cm thick)

    Bw1--13 to 43 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), moist; moderate medium and thin platy structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky, moderately plastic; few coarse and common medium and fine roots; 1 percent gravel; slightly effervescent (7 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are finely disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.

    Bw2--43 to 56 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; very friable, soft, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few coarse and common medium and fine roots; 1 percent gravel; strongly effervescent (8 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are finely disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.

    Bw3--56 to 86m; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3), moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky, moderately plastic; few coarse and common medium and fine roots; 3 percent gravel; strongly effervescent (7 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are finely disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bw horizons is 15 to 71 cm)

    C--86 to 152 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4), moist; single grain; very friable, loose, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common medium and fine roots; 1 percent cobbles, 19 percent gravel; strongly effervescent (9 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are finely disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in this family.   Soils in similar families include the Glendive, Spang and Toby series.  Spang and Toby soils do not have an irregular decrease in organic matter with depth.  Glendive soils do not have a cambic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  alluvium derived from calcareous sandstone and shale.
Landform:  mountain drainageways
Slopes:  1 to 5 percent
Elevation:  2,012 to 2,438 meters
Mean annual temperature:  3.3 to 7.2 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation:  30.5 to 40.6 cm
Precipitation pattern:  Wettest months are July to October and driest months are December and June.
Frost-free period:  85 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Podo, Skein and Wiggler series.  These soils have a lithic or paralithic contact at less than 52 cm and are on steep mountainsides above the Lilapoint soils under pinyon pine.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, low runoff, moderate permeability, rarely flooded for brief periods during the months of March through October.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation includes basin big sagebrush, rabbitbrush, Indian ricegrass, Salina wildrye, needleandthread and scattered pinyon pine.  These soils are correlated to R034XY009UT Loamy Bottom (Basin big sagebrush) ecological site at the type location in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mountains of central Utah, Warm Central Desertic Basins and Plateaus; LRR D, MLRA 34B; small extent.  About 1,190 acres (480 hectares) in Emery County, Utah.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 200 cm.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 25 to 100 cm.  (parts of the Bw3 and C horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 5 cm.  (A horizon)
Cambic horizon:  The zone from 5 to 34 cm.  (Bw horizons)
Fluventic feature:  0.2 percent or more organic-carbon content (Holocene age) at a depth of 125 cm below the mineral soil surface.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
