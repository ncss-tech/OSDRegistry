REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters (10 to 40 inches) (Bw, Bk1, Bk2, Bk3, and C1 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 152 centimeters (0 to 60 inches) (A, Bw, Bk1, Bk2, Bk3, C1, and C2 horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 13 centimeters (0 to 5 inches) (A horizon);
calcic horizon--the zone from a depth of 30 to 97 centimeters (12 to 38 inches) (Bk1, Bk2, and Bk3 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

The cation-exchange activity class is supported by lab sample number S1997IA047015 Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory.

Taxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy 2014.

The redoximorphic features occurring in the Bk, and C horizons are not considered as indicators of present-day wetness and therefore were not considered in the classification of these soils.

This series replaces the Steinauer series that was correlated in the Soil Survey of Woodbury County, Iowa (1972).

The pre-Illinoian till does not have shale fragments, has half as much very coarse sand in the sand fraction, has a moderate shrink-swell potential, and has less calcium carbonate and less dolomite content than early Wisconsin (Tazewell) till.
