LYKENS SERIES

The Lykens series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in silty lacustrine deposits, a thin layer of loamy water-sorted material, and the underlying loamy till on water modified till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Hartz, Henshaw, Higdon, Ogontz, Sardinia, and Travilah series. Hartz soils are deeper than 127 cm (50 inches) to carbonates. Henshaw soils do not have rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Higdon and Sardinia soils have sola thicker than 127 cm (50 inches). Ogontz soils have strata with less than 18 percent clay and more than 50 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Travilah soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lykens soils are on water modified till plains of late Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. The soils formed in silty lacustrine deposits or slackwater sediments 51 to 91 cm (20 to 36 inches) thick that commonly contain a high amount of very fine sand in the lower part, a middle layer of loamy water-sorted materials 5 to 38 cm (2 to 15 inches) thick, and the underlying loamy, low-lime till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 787 to 1016 mm (31 to 40 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 12 degrees C (47 to 53 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bennington, Cardington, Fitchville, Glenford, and Tiro soils. The somewhat poorly drained Bennington soils and the Cardington soils are on nearby till plains that have not been modified by water. The somewhat poorly drained Fitchville soils and the Glenford soils formed in thicker lacustrine deposits. The somewhat poorly drained Tiro soils formed in similar materials but are on lower topographic positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The potential for surface runoff is low to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part of the solum and moderately low in the till material. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and moderately slow or slow in the lower part of the solum and underlying till.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used for cropland or permanent pasture but a few areas are used for woodland. Corn, soybeans, small grain, and legume grass meadow are principal crops. Native vegetation is hardwood forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North central Ohio; MLRAs 111E and 139. The type location is in MLRA 111E. The series is of small extent, about 4,000 acres.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Crawford County, Ohio, 1975.

REMARKS: The Lykens series is marginal to fine-loamy.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 33 cm (Ap, BE horizons).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 33 to 74 cm (Bt, 2Bt horizons).
Aquic conditions: redox features in all horizons below a depth of 43 cm.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available for CR-27, the typical pedon, from the Soil Characterization Laboratory at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.
