MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Halifax County, Virginia; 2003.

REMARKS: Lackstown soils were previously mapped as Creedmoor soils. The April 1997 adjustment of the mesic/thermic line in the Southern Piedmont Major Land Resource Area necessitated the establishment of a mesic counterpart for the Creedmoor series.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 14 inches (A and E horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 14 to 54 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Btg1, and Btg2 horizons)
Aquic conditions--periodic saturation and reduction within 28 to 54 inches of the soil surface, and one or more unsaturated layers within 80 inches of the surface, occurring below the periodically saturated zone (episaturation)

Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches
