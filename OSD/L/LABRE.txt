LABRE SERIES

The Labre series consists of very deep, well drained soils that have moderately rapid permeability and are formed in material derived from baked sandstone and shale. These soils are on fans remnants, foothills, and uplands. Slopes are 2 to 25 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform - fan remnants, foothills, and uplands that have a plane or convex surface. 
Elevations - 3,250 to 4,700 feet. 
Slope - predominantly 2 to 8 percent, but ranges from 2 to 25 percent. Parent material - material derived from baked sandstone and shale.
Climate - cool and moist with long cold winters and moist springs and summers. 
Mean annual temperature - 38 to 45 degrees F. 
Mean annual precipitation - 15 to 20 inches. 
Frost free season is 80 to 130 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bitton, Cabba, Doney, Lamedeer, Ringling, Shambo, and Twin Creek soils. Bitton soils formed in alluvium on fans, foot slopes, and terraces, and typically have very gravelly loam profiles. Cabba soils are on uplands and have a paralithic contact at depths of 25 to 51 cm. Doney soils are on uplands and are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Lamedeer soils are on fans, foot slopes, and uplands. They have an O horizon and do not have a mollic epipedon. Ringling soils are on uplands and have fractured bedrock at depths of 13 to 51 cm. Shambo soils are on fans and terraces and have solums with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y. Twin Creek soils are on fans, terraces, and foot slopes and contain less than 5 percent coarse fragments.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: The Labre soils are used mainly for rangeland and to a lesser degree for cropland, hay, and pasture. The potential native vegetation is bluebunch wheatgrass, big bluestem, needleandthread, little bluestem, Idaho fescue, forbs, and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern and central Montana. Labre soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.  MLRA 43B, 44B, 58A.
