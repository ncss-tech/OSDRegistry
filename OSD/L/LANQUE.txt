LANQUE SERIES

The Lanque series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in fan and stream alluvium from granite and gneiss.  Lanque soils are on fan terraces and stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Pachic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lanque sandy loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 4 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and few medium roots; common fine irregular pores; 10 percent gravel; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 8 inches thick)

    C1--4 to 19 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) sandy loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; common fine irregular pores; 10 percent gravel; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.

    C2--19 to 46 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) coarse sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the C horizons is 32 to 38 inches thick)

    2Bb--46 to 60 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 6.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  Fort Huachuca, Arizona; located at a latitude of 31 degrees, 31 minutes, 45 seconds North and longitude of 110 degrees, 18 minutes, 45 seconds West.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July - September and December - February.  Driest during May and June.  Aridic ustic soil moisture regime.

Soil Temperature:  59 to 64 degrees F.

Rock fragments:  less than 35 percent, but can range to 55 percent in any one horizon

Clay content:  3 to 15 percent

Organic Matter:  averages 1 to 3 percent in the control section and includes the upper C horizon.  The lower part of the C horizon in some pedons have less than .5 percent

Some pedons do not have a 2Bb or 2Btb horizon

Reaction:  slightly acid to slightly alkaline

A horizon
Hue:  10YR, 7.5YR
Value:  2 through 5 dry, 2 to 4 moist
Chroma:  1 through 3, dry or moist
Reaction: slightly acid or neutral

C horizons

2Bb or 2Btb horizon (when present)
Hue: 10YR, 7.5YR
Value: 2 through 7 dry, 2 to 4 moist
Chroma: 1 through 3, dry or moist

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lanque soils are on fan terraces and stream terraces at elevations of 4,000 to 6,200 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  These soils formed in fan and stream alluvium from granite and gneiss.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December and January.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 62 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 160 to 210 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Terrarossa, Pyeatt, Blacktail and Gardencan soils.  Terrarossa, Blacktail and Gardencan soils have argillic horizons.  Pyeatt soils have calcic horizons.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Lanque soils are used for livestock grazing, military training, recreation and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation includes sideoats grama, blue grama, cane beardgrass, wooly bunchgrass, plains lovegrass, green sprangletop, forbs, shrubby buckwheat, Emory oak and mesquite.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Arizona.  Lanque soils are of limited extent.  MLRAs are 38 and 41.
