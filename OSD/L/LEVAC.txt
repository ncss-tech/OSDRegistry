LEVAC SERIES

The Levac series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils.  These nearly level soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits of the Beaumont Formation. These soils have been leveled for rice irrigation.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 20.6 degrees C (69 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1397 mm (55 in).

COMPETING SERIES: This includes the Yeaton and Telferner series. Similar soils include Algoa), Bernard, Labelle, Mocarey, Morey, Viterbo and soils.
Telferner soils: have thicker A and E horizons; occur in areas of less rainfall
Yeaton soils: are moderately well drained
Algoa and Mocarey soils: have a fine-loamy particle-size control section.
Bernard, Morey, and Labelle soils: have a mollic epipedon.
Viterbo soils:  are acid throughout; have aquic condtions.
Yeaton soils: are moderately well drained; do not have vertic properties

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loamy fluviomarine sediments derived from the Beaumont Formation of Pleistocene age
Landscape: flat coastal plains
Landform: flats
Anthropogenic feature: leveled pimple mound
Slope: 0 to 1 percent
Mean annual air temperature range: 20.0 to 22.2 degrees C (68 to 72 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation range: 1219 to 1575 mm (48 to 62 in)
Precipitation Pattern: Rainfall is fairly uniform throughout the year with slight peaks in the fall and spring months.
Frost-free period: 270 to 300 days
Elevation: 3 to 30.5 m (10 to 100 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aris, Anahuac, Labelle, Orcadia, Meaton, Morey, and the Spindletop series.
Aris soils: are gray throughout due to wetness; on flats
Anahuac and Orcadia soils: are on a broader landform
Labelle, Meaton and Morey soils: somewhat poorly drained; on flats
Spindletop soils: moderately well drained; pimple mounds

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: somewhat poorly drained. The runoff is high unless the argillic horizon starts below a depth of 50 cm; in which case, the runoff is medium. Rarey flooded for very brief to brief periods. Flooding occurs as a result of storm surge during tropical storms which occurs in areas less than 4.6 m (15 ft) elevation. These soils have episaturation from 20 to 75 cm (8 to 30 in) below the soil surface from January to March and endosaturation from 150 to 203 cm (60 to 80 in) below the surface during the same period. Episaturation is less than 2 weeks in continuous duration.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for rice production or pasture.  Pasture is mainly bahiagrass.  Native grasses include species of sedges, andropogon, paspalum and panicum.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The gulf coast of southeastern Texas east of the Trinity River and possibly southwestern Louisiana; Land Resource Region T; MLRA 150A; the series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Jefferson County, Texas; 1996

REMARKS:  Levac soils are developing in areas that were originally Spindletop soils. The Spindletop soils are on pimple mounds.  These mounds were leveled and an Ap horizon formed during leveling operations. The type location was moved during the update of MLRA 150A to a location with laboratory data.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle size control section: 48 to 98 cm (19 to 39 in. (Btk and Btkss1 horizons) 

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 48 cm (0 to 19in). (Ap1, Ap2, and A horizons) 
Argillic horizon: 48 to 203 cm (19 to 80in). (Bt, Btkss1, Btkss2, Btkss3, Btkssg horizons)
Vertic features: The presence of cracks from 0 to 72 cm (0 to 28 in) and slickensides from 72 to 203 cm (28 to 80 in). (Btkss1, Btkss2, Btkss3, Btkssg horizons)

Additional Comments: The type location was described when soil conditions were slightly moist and dry consistence could not be observed. When dry, the consistence for these soils are very hard in the surface layer.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Data exists from pedon S10TX0714802 at the type location
