LONGRIE SERIES

The Longrie series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in loamy glacial deposits underlain by limestone bedrock at a depth of 50 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) on ground moraines, glacial lake benches, and terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 4.4 degrees C (40 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplorthods

TYPICAL PEDON: Longrie sandy loam, in a forested area. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 A--0 to 10 cm (4 inches); black (5YR 2/1) sandy loam, dark gray (7.5YR 4/1) dry; moderate medium granular structure; friable; many fine to coarse roots; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. [0 to 13 cm (5 inches) thick]

 E--10 to 23 cm (4 to 9 inches); reddish gray (5YR 5/2) sandy loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine to coarse roots; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. [5 to 20 cm (2 to 8 inches) thick]

 Bhs--23 to 28 cm (9 to 11 inches); dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) fine sandy loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine to coarse roots; moderately acid; clear irregular boundary. [0 to 5 cm (2 inches) thick]

 Bs--28 to 69 cm (11 to 27 inches); reddish brown (5YR 4/4) fine sandy loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine and medium roots; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. [13 to 56 cm (5 to 22 inches) thick]

 C--69 to 79 cm (27 to 31 inches); light brown (7.5YR 6/4) gravelly loam; massive; friable; common fine and medium roots; about 15 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.

 2R--79 to 104 cm (31 to 41 inches); limestone bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Onota series. Onota soils more acidic than slightly alkaline in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Longrie soils are on bedrock controlled ground moraines, glacial lake benches, and terraces. Slope gradients are dominantly 0 to 6 percent but range from 0 to 35 percent. They formed in 50 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loamy till overlying limestone, dolomite, or dolomitic limestone bedrock. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 838 mm (27 to 33 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 5.0 to 7.2 degrees C (41 to 45 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Amadon, Ensign, Greylock, Nahma, Omena, Onaway, Ruse, Sundell, and Trenary soils. The somewhat poorly drained Sundell soils are on slightly lower landscape positions. The poorly drained Nahma soils are in depressions and drainageways. The Sundell and Nahma soils form a drainage sequence with Longrie soils. Associated loamy soils less than 50 cm (20 inches) deep to bedrock are the well drained Amadon soils on similar landscape positions, and the somewhat poorly drained Ensign and poorly drained Ruse soils on lower landscape positions. The Greylock, Omena, Onaway, and Trenary soils are very deep, well drained, loamy soils on similar landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to high depending on slope. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of the Longrie soils are in woodland with sugar maple, yellow birch, American beech, quaking aspen, and balsam fir being the principal species. Those areas in cropland are used for oats, wheat, corn, hay crops, and pasture. Cherry and apple orchards are on this soil in the Door Peninsula of Wisconsin.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 93B, 94B, 94C, and 95A in northern Lower Michigan, southern and eastern Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and northeastern Wisconsin. The series is of moderate extent.
