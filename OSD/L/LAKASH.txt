LAKASH SERIES

The Lakash series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic ash.  Lakash soils are on lake plain terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 130 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Ashy, glassy, calcareous, mesic Vitrandic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lakash ashy loamy sand--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is partially covered with 35 percent gravel.

    A--0 to 13 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) ashy loamy sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderate medium platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.7); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 13 cm thick)

    Bw--13 to 27 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) ashy sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate thin and medium platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and few fine and medium roots; common very fine interstitial and few fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 20 cm thick)

    C1--27 to 36 cm; pale yellow (2.5Y 8/2) ashy fine sandy loam, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.7); clear wavy boundary.  (13 to 20 cm thick)

    C2--36 to 61 cm; white (N 8/) ashy fine sandy loam, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) moist; massive; hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; common medium and coarse prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation which are relict redoximorphic features; 5 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); clear wavy boundary. (20 to 30 cm thick)

    2C--61 to 76 cm; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) ashy sand, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; few medium prominent brown (7.5YR 5/4) masses of iron accumulation which are relict redoximorphic features; 5 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 25 cm thick)

    3C1--76 to 114 cm; white (5Y 8/1) ashy fine sandy loam, light olive gray (5Y 6/2) moist; moderate medium platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 50 cm thick)

    3C2--114 to 152 cm; white (5Y 8/1) ashy fine sandy loam, light olive gray (5Y 6/2) moist; moderate medium platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  Mineral County, Nevada; 2,000 feet south and 800 feet east of the northwest corner of section 6, T. 8 N., R. 31 E.; USGS Hawthorne East 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 35 minutes 06 seconds N and longitude 118 degrees 34 minutes 27 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.5851111 latitude, -118.5741667 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture Usually dry, moist in some part for short periods during winter and early spring and for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October following convection storms; typic aridic soil moisture regime. 
Mean annual soil temperature: 13 to 15 degrees C.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  5 to 10 percent.
Rock fragment content: less than 15 percent; Volcanic glass content: more than 30 percent in the coarse silt through very coarse sand fractions.

A horizon
Chroma:  2 or 3.

Bw horizon
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Texture:  Ashy loamy sand or ashy sandy loam.
Clay content: 5 to 12 percent.
Rock fragment content:  Less than 15 percent.
Structure:  Platy or subangular blocky.

C horizons
Hue:  2.5Y, 5Y or N.
Value:  7 or 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist.
Chroma:  0 through 2.
Texture:  Ashy fine sandy loam, but strata of ashy sand, ashy loamy sand, or ashy loamy fine sand are present in most pedons.
Clay content:  5 to 10 percent.
Rock fragments:  Less than 15 percent.
Structure:  Platy or is massive.
Consistence:  Soft through hard, dry.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Alamedawell series. Alamedawell soils have an aridic soil moisture regime that borders on xeric.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lakash soils are on lake plain terraces.  They formed in lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 4,140 to 4,280 feet.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 80 to 150, the mean annual temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 130 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Patna and Demill series.  Patna soils have argillic horizons.  Demill soils have layers of silica cementation.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; very low surface runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Lakash soils are used for ammunition storage, rangeland, and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly shadscale, Cooper wolfberry, fourwing saltbush, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  These soils are not extensive with about 1,300 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 29.
