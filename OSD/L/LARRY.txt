LARRY SERIES 

The Larry series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on flood plains, flood-plain steps, drainageways, and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 457 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 4.4 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Endoaquolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Larry clay loam, in meadow grasses (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oa--0 to 5 cm; black (N 2/) muck, very dark gray (N 3/) dry; massive and tightly bound by grass roots; slightly acid (pH 6.5); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 5 cm thick) 

    A--5 to 23 cm; black (N 2/) clay loam, very dark gray (N 3/) dry; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual smooth boundary. (18 to 25 cm thick) 

    Bg--23 to 43 cm; very dark gray (N 3/) clay loam, dark gray (N 4/) dry; moderate medium blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual smooth boundary. (13 to 38 cm thick) 

    Cg1--43 to 74 cm; gray (N 5/) clay loam, gray (N 6/) dry; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) redox concentrations; massive; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few roots; 5 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 64 cm thick) 

    Cg2--74 to 152 cm; mottled light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) and dark gray (N 4/) clay loam; light gray (N 7/) and gray (N 5/) redox depletions; massive; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few roots; 5 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0)
