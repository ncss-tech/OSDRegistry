LAHRITY SERIES

The Lahrity series consists of deep, poorly drained soils that formed in material derived from alluvium.  These soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 480 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, nonacid, frigid Mollic Haplaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lahrity loam, in pasture.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A11--0 to 5 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/2) loam, very dark brown (7.5YR 2/2) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and plastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine and fine pores; medium acid (pH 6.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 cm thick)

    A12--5 to 15 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine and fine pores; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 15 cm thick)

    A2--15 to 28 cm; white (10YR 8/1) very fine sandy loam, light gray (10YR 7/1) moist; weak fine platy structure parting to moderate medium granular; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine pores; root channels and pores filled with A1 horizon material; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 20 cm thick)

    B21t--28 to 53 cm; white (5Y 8/2) very fine sandy loam, pale olive (5Y 6/3) moist; moderate fine and medium platy structure parting to moderate medium granular; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine pores; many moderately thick clay films lining pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.

    B22t--53 to 76 cm; white (5Y 8/2) very fine sandy loam, light olive gray (5Y 6/2) moist; few fine faint mottles; weak coarse blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine pores; many moderately thick clay films lining pores; mildly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the B2 horizons is 41 to 61 cm.)

    B3t--76 to 102 cm; white (5Y 8/1) very fine sandy loam, light olive gray (5Y 6/2) moist; common fine distinct reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/6) mottles; massive; hard, firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine pores; many moderately thick clay films lining pores; mildly alkaline (pH 7.5); abrupt wavy boundary.  (13 to 51 cm thick)

    C--102 to 117 cm; white (5Y 8/1) very gravelly sandy clay loam, light olive gray (5Y 6/2) moist; common fine distinct reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/6) mottles; massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 60 percent pebbles; mildly alkaline (pH 7.5).
