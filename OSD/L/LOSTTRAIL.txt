LOSTTRAIL SERIES

The Losttrail series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in alluvium from mixed sources. These soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, and stream terraces in intermountain valleys. Slopes are 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 368 mm and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Losttrail loam, in rangeland on a 20 percent slope at 1,130 meters elevation (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise indicated). 

	A--0 to 20 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate coarse granular structure; friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky, nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  18 to 30 cm thick)

	Bw--20 to 51 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual smooth boundary. (20 to 46 cm thick)

	Bk--51 to 79 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel; finely disseminated carbonates throughout; strongly effervescent, moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); gradual smooth boundary. (10 to 28 cm thick) 

	C1--79 to 124 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly loamy sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; few fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; 20 percent gravel; very slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8) gradual wavy boundary.  

	C2--124 to 152 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; common fine interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0).
