LOWEMAR SERIES

The Lowemar series consists of moderately deep, excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from metamorphic rocks.  Lowemar soils are on upper mountain backslopes.  Slopes are 50 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 650 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed Xeric Humicryepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lowemar gravelly loamy sandy -- rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is partially covered with 28 percent gravel and 10 percent cobble.

    A1--0 to 2 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loamy sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; few very fine and fine interstitial pores; 20 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 10 cm thick)

    A2--2 to 12 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loamy sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; few very fine and fine interstitial pores; 15 percent gravel and 2 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 40 cm thick)

    A3--12 to 50 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and very few medium roots; few very fine and fine interstitial pores; 18 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear smooth boundary.  (30 to 60 cm thick)

    C--50 to 152 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely cobbly loamy fine sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; few very fine and fine interstitial pores; 14 percent gravel and 50 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no competing soils.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lowemar soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on linear/slightly concave, steeply sloping upper mountain backslopes below rock outcrop on all aspects of upper elevations and northern aspects at lower elevations.  These soils formed in loess over colluvium derived from metamorphic parent material.  Slopes are 50 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 2,680 to 3,050 meters.  The climate is cold. Snow load in the area is thinned due to high velocity winds but persists until June. Summer moisture derives from regular summer thunderstorms in July and August. The mean annual precipitation is 600 cm to 710 mm, and the mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C. Frost may occur at the higher elevations during any of the summer months.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Longhike, Inpendence, Tusel, Shively, and Hapgood soils. Longhike soils have an ochric epipedon and a lithic contact at 75 to 100 cm.  Inpendence soils are frigid with a consistent O horizon development. Tusel soils average greater than 25 percent clay in the particle size control section. Shively soils average less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section. Tusel, Shively and Hapgood soils have a lithic contact at 100 cm or more and a reaction of neutral to slightly acidic with a base saturation greater than 50 percent. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Excessively drained; moderate surface runoff; very high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Lowemar soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly lupine, Letterman needlegrass, rabbitbrush and mountain snowberry. Subalpine knotweed is present at the typical location and has a visible presence on the landscape in the fall. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 25.
