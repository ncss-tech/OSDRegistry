LILAH SERIES

The Lilah series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils formed in 25 to 50 centimeters of loamy sediments and in the underlying sandy and gravelly outwash. These soils are on outwash areas on dissected till plains and treads and risers on stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 850 millimeters.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Howard County, Iowa, 1969

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 23 to 73 centimeters (Bt1, 2Bt2, and 2Bt3 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (Ap, BA, Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3 and 2C horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 15 centimeters (Ap horizon);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 23 to 99 centimeters (Bt1, 2Bt2, and 2Bt3 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Lilah series could be challenged for coarse-loamy particle-size family depending on the thickness and texture of the upper 75 centimeters of the argillic horizon.

Lilah series may classify as a Mollic Hapludalfs, but the sandy loam portion of the argillic horizon is thought to be consistently less than 20 centimeters thick and this series is classified on that basis. There is some question as to the presence of an argillic horizon as the illuvial horizon does not always have a 3 percent (absolute) increase in total clay than the eluvial horizon.
