REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 43 centimeters (0 to 17 inches) (Ap and BA horizons)
Cambic horizon--the zone from 43 to 75 centimeters (17 to 30 inches) (Bw horizon)
Aquic conditions--the soil has redox depletions within 43 cm (17 inches) of the surface, with periodic saturation and reduction at some time during the year
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 150 cm (0 to 59 inches)

Rev. KOS-ART-WJE-AWD-MS 02/2008 updated pedon description and competing series.  Rev. MDJ 2/2009 update was to remove Missouri from and add Alabama to states where used and format description.
