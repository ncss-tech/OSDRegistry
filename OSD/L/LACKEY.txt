LACKEY SERIES

The Lackey series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in colluvium and till weathered from granitic rocks. The Lackey soils are on mountain slopes, moraines, colluvial aprons, and talus slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 2 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 800 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Sandy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Vitrandic Xerorthents

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Lackey soils are on linear backslopes of mountain slopes, and moraines, colluvial aprons, and talus slopes on glacial-valley walls and glacial-valley floors. Slopes range from 2 to 75 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and till over residuum weathered from granite and granodiorite. Elevation is 1715 to 3235 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 1410 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 2 to 9 degrees C. The frost-free season is 60 to 145 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dorst and Kanawyer soils. The Dorst soils are on convex structural benches of mountain slopes and are less than 50 cm to a lithic contact. The Kanawyer soils are on linear to convex moraines and have a densic contact between 50 and 100 cm.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained, high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Vegetation is red fir, white fir, Jeffrey pine, lodgepole pine, western white pine, greenleaf manzanita, and chinquapin.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. These soils are of limited extent.
