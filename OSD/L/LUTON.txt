LUTON SERIES

The Luton series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils formed in clayey alluvium. These soils are on flood plains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas have been drained or have been land graded and are cultivated. The principal crops are corn, soybeans, and wheat. The native vegetation is big bluestem, western wheatgrass, sedges, blue grama and other species of the tall grass prairie that are tolerant of excessive wetness. See Additional Data section for native vegetative cover in Iowa.
