LUPPINO SERIES

The Luppino series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from granodiorite. Luppino soils are on pediments and hills.  The slopes are 4 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Aridic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Luppino gravelly sandy loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). The surface is covered w1th about 65 percent gravel.

    A1--0 to 15 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 30 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 15 cm thick)

    A2--15 to 20 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many very fine interstitial and tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 13 cm thick)

    Bt--20 to 36 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; common very fine interstitial and tubular pores; many faint clay bridges between sand grains; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (13 to 25 cm thick)

    Cr--36 to 58 cm; granodiorite saprolite. (8 to 30 cm thick)

    R--58 cm; granodiorite.

TYPE LOCATION: Washoe County, Nevada; approximately 5 miles north of Sparks; about 1,200 feet west and 1,300 feet south of the northeast corner of section 7, T. 20 N., R 20 E.; USGS Reno 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 37 minutes 2 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 46 minutes 31 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.6172222 latitude, -119.7752778 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually moist in the winter and spring and dry in the summer and fall; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 10 to 11 degrees C.
Depth to paralithic contact: 30 to 50 cm.
Depth to hard bedrock: 50 to 76 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 18 to 30 percent.
Rock fragments: Average 0 to 15 percent, dominantly 2-5 mm granitic gravel, some layers have up to 35 gravel.

A horizons
Value: 4 or 5 dry.

Bt horizon
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR 
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 3 or 4.
Texture:  Sandy clay loam or sandy loam, and is gravelly in some pedons.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Arclay, Crawley, Nomisurvey, Siscab and Wedekind series. 

Arclay, Crawley, Siscab and Wedekind soils lack hard bedrock within 100 cm. Nomisuvey soils average 25 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Luppino soi1s are on pediments and hills. Elevations are 1,370 to 2,317 meters. Slopes are 4 to 30 percent. They have formed in residuum weathered from granodiorite. The climate is semiarid. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 9 to 10 degrees C, the frost-free season is 100 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Acrelane, Greenbrae, Haybourne, and Indian Creek series. Acrelane soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section. Haybourne soils are deep sandy loams and loamy sands. Greenbrae soils are over 150 cm deep and are formed in alluvium. Indian Creek soils have a clay B2t horizon and silica cemented hardpan.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderately slow permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Luppino soils are used principally for range, recreation, and urban development. The native vegetation is juniper, rabbitbrush, ephedra, bitterbrush, buckwheat, and desert needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Lyon and Washoe Counties, Nevada. The series is of moderate extent. MLRA 26.
