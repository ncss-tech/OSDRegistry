LEMOYNE SERIES

The Lemoyne series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on high flood plains.  They formed in eolian sand deposited over loamy and sandy alluvium.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 43 centimeters (17 inches).  The mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C. (50 degrees F.)

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy over loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Calciustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lemoyne sand, on a 1 percent slope in reseeded native grasses. When described the soil was dry throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  A1--15 to 33 centimeters (6 to 13 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sand; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; loose; slight effervescence, slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.

  A2--33 to 46 centimeters (13 to 18 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loamy sand; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable; slight effervescence, slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (Combined A horizon is 30 to 61 centimeters (12 to 24 inches) thick)

  2Bw1--46 to 56 centimeters (18 to 22 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam; brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, firm; sodium adsorption ratio= 5; 9 percent calcium carbonate; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.

  2Bw2--56 to 91 centimeters (22 to 36 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy clay loam; brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; hard, friable; sodium adsorption ratio= 5; 7 percent calcium carbonate; violent effervescence; strongly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (Combined Bw horizon is 25 to 61 centimeters (10 to 24 inches) thick)

(13 to 61 centimeters (5 to 24 inches) thick)

  2Cg--137 to 203 centimeters (54 to 80 inches); very pale brown (10YR 7/3) coarse sand; light gray (10YR 7/2) moist; single grain; loose; sodium adsorption ratio= 7; strongly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: eolian sands deposited over loamy and sandy alluvium 
Landform: high flood plains  
Mean annual precipitation: 36 to 46 centimeters (14 to 18 inches)  
Mean annual temperature: 8 to 12 degrees C. (47 to 53 degrees F.)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Jankosh, Lewellen, McCuligan, Rushcreek and Scoville soils.  
Jankosh and Lewellen soils are lower on the landscape, have a higher seasonal water table and are strongly alkaline.  
McCuligan soils have a higher seasonal water table, are lower on the landscape and are shallow over coarse sand.  
Rushcreek soils are fine loamy, have a mollic epipedon and are on similar landscapes.  
Scoville soils are on stream terraces and typically are sandy in the upper 40 inches of the series control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage: moderately well drained  
Runoff: low  
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: moderately high to high 
Seasonal high water table depth: 0.9 to 1.8 meters (3 to 6 feet)

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of the acreage is used for irrigated cropland.   
Common crops are corn and alfalfa.  
Most areas have been land leveled for gravity irrigation.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nebraska.  The series is not extensive.
