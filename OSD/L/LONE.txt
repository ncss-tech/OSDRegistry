LONE SERIES

The Lone series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in a loess mantel over lake deposits of sand and gravel derived from limestone, sandstone, shale, tuffs, and siliceous conglomerate with some volcanic ash. Lone soils are on lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 225 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TYPE LOCATION: Eureka County, Nevada; 1,425 feet west and 60 feet south of the northeast corner of sec. 25, T. 21 N., R. 53 E.; USGS North of Eureka 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 39 minutes 55 seconds N and longitude 115 degrees 57 minutes 3 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.6652778 latitude, -115.9508333 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture:  Usually dry, mainly in the summer and fall months, but are moist during the winter and early spring; aridic soil moisture regime bordering in xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.
Mean summer soil temperature: 16 to 17 degrees C.
Depth to sand and gravel: 46 to 60 cm.
Depth to duripan: 60 to 90 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Average 12 to 18 percent.   
Rock fragments:  Average 35 to 50 percent

A horizon
Value: 5 or 6 dry, and 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3.
Average organic carbon content in the upper 18 cm: less than 0.58 percent, or the dry value is more than 5.
Consistence: Platy or fine granular structure or is massive.

Bw horizon 
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR. 
Value: 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3.
Clay content: 15 to 35 percent.
Texture:  Loam or clay loam.
Rock fragments: 10 to 30 percent.
Structure: It has weak or moderate, medium or coarse subangular blocky structure or the horizon is massive.

Bqk horizon
Clay content: 5 to 15 percent.
Texture: Very gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly loamy sand.
Rock fragments: 35 to 50 percent, dominantly fine gravel.

2Bqk horizon
Clay content: 5 to 10 percent.
Rock fragments: 35 to 60 percent.

Bqkm horizon 
Other features: from one to several layers of cementation, of which at least one is indurated and ranges from less than 2.5 to 15 cm in thickness. The other layers are weakly through strongly cemented.

3C horizon 
Rock fragments: 35 to 60 percent gravel.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ridit and Westindian series. Ridit soils have duripans capping bedrock at depths of 50 to 100 cm. Westindian soils have silt loam or loam above the duripan.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lone soils are on lake terraces. Elevations are 1,770 to 1,800 meters. These soils formed in a thin loess mantle capping sands and gravel derived from limestone, sandstone, shale, tuffs, and siliceous conglomerate with some volcanic ash. Mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm. Mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Nayped, Alhambra, Silverado and Kobeh soils. All of these soils lack the indurated duripan, and have durinodes in a friable matrix or are only weakly cemented.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well-drained; slow runoff; moderate permeability to the pan; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Livestock grazing. Vegetation is primarily big sagebrush with some Sandberg bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Valleys of north-central Nevada. Lone soils are inextensive, with about 5,700 acres. MLRA 28B.
