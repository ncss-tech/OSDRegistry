LARKSPUR SERIES

The Larkspur series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and/or residuum over rhyolite and other moderately fine-grained igneous rocks.  These soils are on mountains, hills and ridges of structural benches.  Slopes are 4 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 381 millimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, nonacid Lithic Cryorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Larkspur very cobbly coarse sandy loam, in rangeland on a 19 percent slope at 1,717 meters elevation colors are for dry soil unless otherwise indicated).

    A--0 to 8 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very cobbly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium granular structure; very friable, slightly hard, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and few medium roots; many fine interstitial pores; 25 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 28 cm thick)

    C--8 to 20 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) very cobbly coarse sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; common fine nterstitial pores; 30 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt irregular boundary. 

    R--20 to 152 cm; fractured gray rhyolitic tuff.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - mountains, hills and ridges on structural benches
Elevation - 1,560 to 2,289 meters
Slope - 4 to 70 percent
Parent material - colluvium and/or residuum over rhyolite, rhyodacite, or rhyolitic tuff
Climate - long, cold winters; cold, moist springs; short, cool summers
Mean annual precipitation - 305 to 483 millimeters, much of which falls as snow and as spring rain
Mean annual air temperature - 1 to 5 degrees centigrade
Frost-free period - 30 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Associated soils which occur on similar landforms are the Poin, Hungryhill and Bigbutte series.  Poin soils are shallow to bedrock and have a mollic epipedon.  Hungryhill soils are moderately deep to bedrock and have a zone of clay accumulation.  Bigbutte soils are moderately 
deep and have an ashy particle-size family.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Larkspur soils are used mainly for grazing; vegetation is chiefly mixed grasses, such as Bluebunch Wheatgrass and Idaho fescue with some areas of widely scattered Douglas fir and Rocky Mountain Juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Larkspur soils are of small extent in the intermontane basins of central Montana. MLRA 43.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 8 cm (A horizon)
Particle-size control section - from 0 to 20 cm (A and C horizons)
Larkspur soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
