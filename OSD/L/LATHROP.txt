LATHROP SERIES

The Lathrop series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in derived alluvium from mixed rocks.  Lathrop soils are on alluvial fans and fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Durinodic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lathrop gravelly loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lathrop soils are on alluvial fans and alluvial fan piedmonts.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from granitic, rhyolitic, and tuffaceous rocks.  Elevations are 1,408 to 2,134 meters. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The climate is arid.  The mean annual precipitation is 125 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Quima and Wardenot soils.  Quima soils have a sandy loam particle-size control section.  Wardenot soils lack an argillic horizon and are sandy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland.  Vegetation is principally shadscale, bud sagebrush, winterfat, galleta, littleleaf rabbitbrush, globemallow, king desertgrass, ephedra and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Valleys in central Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 29.
