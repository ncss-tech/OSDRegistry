LIGOCKI SERIES 

The Ligocki series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and fan alluvium derived from mixed sources. Ligocki soils are on fan remnants on valley sides. Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON: Ligocki fine sandy loam--in a cutover ponderosa pine woodland kept in pasture on a north facing, convex, 3 percent slope at an elevation of 7,890 feet (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak thin platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 9 inches thick)

    AB--3 to 9 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt1--9 to 20 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; strong fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine, fine, and few medium roots; few fine and medium irregular pores; many prominent clay films on faces of peds; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (10 to 30 inches thick)

    2Btk1--20 to 30 inches; red (2.5YR 5/6) clay loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; 4 percent gravel sized limestone fragments; many prominent clay films on faces of peds; strongly effervescent; common fine masses and concretions of calcium carbonate; calcium carbonate equivalent 10 percent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.

    2Btk2--30 to 48 inches; red (2.5YR 5/6) gravelly sandy clay loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; 20 percent gravel sized limestone fragments; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; slightly effervescent; few very fine masses and concretions of calcium carbonate; calcium carbonate equivalent 11 percent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.

    3Btk3--48 to 70 inches; red (2.5YR 5/6) sandy clay loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few distinct clay films bridging sand grains; very slightly effervescent; few very fine masses of calcium carbonate; calcium carbonate equivalent 5 percent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8). (The combined thickness of the Btk horizons is 25 to 45 inches thick)

TYPE LOCATION: McKinley County, New Mexico; Page Quadrangle; about 1.0 mile south of Page, New Mexico; 700 feet north and 2,000 feet west of the southwest corner of section 32, T.13N., R. 15W.; 108 degrees 27 minutes 13 seconds west longitude, 35 degrees 18 minutes 31 seconds north latitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture: The SMCS is usually moist, in some part, for more than 90 cumulative days from May through October. It is usually dry, in all parts, for less than 90 cumulative days during the same period. It is continuously moist in some part November through April. The period of maximum precipitation is July through October. The soil is driest during May and June. Typic ustic moisture
regime. 

Soil Temperature: 42 to 47 degrees F

Particle size control section: 35 to 50 percent clay

Depth to secondary carbonates: 20 to 40 inches

A and AB horizons
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 3 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Rock fragments: 0 to 5 percent (rock fragments are granite, sandstone, or limestone)

Bt horizon
Hue: 2.5YR or 5YR
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 4 or 6
Rock fragments: 0 to 5 percent (rock fragments are granite, sandstone, or limestone)

Btk horizon:
Hue: 2.5YR or 5YR
Value: 5 or 6 dry
Textures: clay loam or sandy clay loam
Rock fragments: 0 to 20 percent (rock fragments are igneous, sandstone, or limestone)
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 5 to 15 percent
Reaction: moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Crow (MT), Dargol (NM), Echolake (CO), Fortlewis (CO), Heckly (NM), Lubrecht (MT), Rittel (MT), Valnor (NM), and Zuni (NM) series. Crow soils formed in parent material and on landforms associated with glaciers, typically have yellower hues, and are more acidic. Dargol, Fortlewis, Heckly, and Zuni soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Echolake, Lubrecht, Rittel and Valnor soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. In addition, Crow, Fortlewis, Lubrecht and Rittel soils are in LRR-E and are more moist in May and June. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Ligocki soils formed in alluvium and fan alluvium derived from mixed sources and are on fan remnants on valley sides. Slopes are 1 to 5 percent. Elevations range from 7,700 to 8,000 feet. The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches. The frost free period is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cinnadale, Heckly, Polich, Robolata, and Zuni soils. Cinnadale and Heckly soils are shallow and moderately deep on hills and ridges. Polich soils are somewhat poorly drained on floodplains. Robolata soils have mollic epipedons greater than 16 inches thick and are on stream terraces.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, high runoff, and slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: This series is used for livestock grazing, wood products, and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is a ponderosa pine woodland with an understory of Arizona fescue, mountain muhly, prairie junegrass, and western wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West central, New Mexico; MLRA 39, LRR-D. This series is of small extent.
