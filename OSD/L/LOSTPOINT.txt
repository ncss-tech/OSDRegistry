LOSTPOINT SERIES

The Lostpoint series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in fine alluvium derived from mixed rock sources resting on old semi-consolidated sand. Lostpoint soils are on hills and terraces and have slopes of 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 245 millimeters (9.5 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 17 degrees C. (63 degrees F.).

Paralithic contact - at a depth of 112 centimeters
Paralithic materials - the zone from a depth of 112 to 152 centimeters

This description reflects a change in classification from Fine, smectitic, thermic Halic Haploxererts to Fine, smectitic, thermic Sodic Haploxererts based on exchangeable sodium percent (ESP) and electrical conductivity (EC) values in the range in characteristics.

OSD revised during correlation of the San Clemente Island Interim Report in 2018.
