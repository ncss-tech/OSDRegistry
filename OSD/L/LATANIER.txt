LATANIER SERIES

The Latanier series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on natural levees on alluvial plains, and formed in reddish clayey Holocene alluvium overlying Holocene loamy alluvium, of the Arkansas and Red Rivers. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 19.0 degrees C (66.2 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1465 mm (57.7 in). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey over loamy, smectitic over mixed, superactive, thermic Oxyaquic HapludertS

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for cultivation in areas protected by levees. Principal crops are cotton, soybeans, corn, rice and small grains. Native vegetation consists of mixed hardwoods.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas 

SERIES PROPOSED: Rapides Parish, Louisiana; 1970. The name is from a nearby community. 

REMARKS: The series was formerly included in the Alluvial great soil group. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Particle-size control section: 25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in) (Bss1, Bss2, 2C1 horizon) 
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 64 cm (0 to 25 in) (Ap, Bss1 horizons) 
Cambic horizon: 15 to 76 cm (6 to 30 in) (Bss horizons) 
Vertic features: presence of slickensides at 15 to 76 cm (6 to 30 in) (Bss horizons)
Lithologic discontinuity: upper boundary of the 2C1 horizon 

Additional Comments: 
The presence of cracks at 0 to 64 cm (0 to 25 in) during dry periods. (Ap, Bss horizons) 

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from S65LA-41-5 from Red River Parish, Louisiana. 

Edited 01/2017 (JAD-MJB) Changed to tabular format. Updated pedon description, range in characteristics, and other sections.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Particle-size analysis were performed at the project office on nine pedons.
