LONGFORD SERIES

The Longford series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess or reworked loess over reworked residuum weathered from sandstone and shale.  Longford soils are on hillslopes on uplands in the Central Kansas Sandstone Hills, MLRA 74.   Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters (30 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).

Crete soils are on higher interfluves or hillslopes, have a mollic epipedon that makes pachic, and have more clay in the particle-size control section.  
Geary soils are on similar positions and are fine-silty.  
Lancaster soils are typically on lower hillslope positions and have a paralithic contact with sandstone or shale within 100 cm.  
Muir soils are on stream terraces and are fine-silty.
