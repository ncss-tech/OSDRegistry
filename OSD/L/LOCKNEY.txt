LOCKNEY SERIES

The Lockney series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey lacustrine deposits of Quaternary age. These nearly level soils are on a playa step in large playa basins. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 483 mm (19 inches) and mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (61 F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, thermic Typic Haplusterts

TYPICAL PEDON: Lockney clay, midway on a playa step, slightly concave, 0.4 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of about 1,109 meters (3,638 feet). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

TYPE LOCATION: Randall County, Texas; from the intersection of State Highway 87 and Highway 217 in Canyon; 11.1 km (6.9 miles) south on Highway 87; 4.4 km (2.7 miles) east on Hungate Road; 366 meters (1,201 feet) north into playa basin; Latitude: 34 degrees, 53 minutes, 10.8 seconds N; Longitude: 101 degrees, 51 minutes, 41.5 seconds W; Nance Ranch, Texas USGS quad; NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: An ustic moisture regime bordering on udic. The soil moisture control section cracks and is dry in some or all parts of the upper 50 cm more than 150 but less than 210 cumulative days in normal years. July through August and November through March are the driest months. These soils are intermittently moist in September through October and April through June. The soil receives runoff from the surrounding uplands and the soil moisture control section is moist for longer periods than normal for the climate. 
Mean annual soil temperature: 15 to 18 degrees C (59 to 64 F). 
Thickness of the mollic epipedon: 25 to 50 cm (9 to 20 inches). 
Depth to secondary calcium carbonate: 50 to 150 cm (20 to 60 inches). 
Depth to calcic horizon: 150 to more than 203 cm (60 to 80 inches). 
Depth to slickensides: 20 to 50 cm (8 to 20 inches). 
Linear extensibility of top 1 meter (40 inches): 7 to 10 cm (2.75 to 4 inches). 
Solum thickness: more than 203 cm (80 inches). 
Particle-size control section (weighted average): 40 to 59 percent silicate clay. 
This is a cyclic soil and undisturbed areas have gilgai microrelief with microhighs 13 to 46 cm (5 to 18 inches) higher than microlows. Distance between the center of the microhigh and the center of the microlow is about 1.5 to 6 meters (5 to 20 feet). The microhigh makes up about 25 percent, the intermediate area between the high and low about 50 percent, and the microlow about 25 percent. Cracks open and close each year, except during higher than normal rainfall years, and remain open for 150 to 210 cumulative days during most years. When dry, 1.3 to 7.6 cm (0.5 to 3 inch) wide cracks, extend from the surface to a depth of 100 cm (40 inches) or more. Cracks are more prominent in the microlow. The range in characteristics represents 50 percent or more of each pedon unless otherwise stated.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the similar Lazbuddie, McLean, Randall, Ranco, and Sparenberg series and also the Arch, Drake, Estacado, Lofton, Pep, and Portales series. 
Lazbuddie and Lofton soils: are on similar playa step landscape positions. 
McLean, Randall, Ranco, and Sparenberg soils: are on the floor of playa basins. 
Arch and Portales soils: are on playa slopes and interdunes and have 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. Very slow permeability. Surface runoff is negligible on concave slopes of less than 1 percent slopes. Ponding is occasional and for very brief periods in most years. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for livestock grazing. Some areas are cultivated to wheat, cotton, or grain sorghum. Native vegetation varies according to amount of water available and may include buffalograss, blue grama, vine mesquite, and western wheatgrass. This soil has been correlated to the Deep Hardland (R077CY022TX) range site in MLRA-77C. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern High Plains, Southern Part (MLRA 77C in LRR H) of western Texas. The series is of minor extent.
