LANDUSKY SERIES

The Landusky series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from igneous rocks.  These soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 25 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fragmental, mixed, frigid Typic Ustorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Landusky extremely cobbly loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--1 inch to 0; forest litter of partially decomposed needles, twigs, and mosses.

    A--0 to 2 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) extremely cobbly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; strong fine and medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine and common medium and coarse roots; 30 percent pebbles, 60 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 4 inches thick)

    Bw--2 to 9 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely cobbly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine and common medium and coarse roots; 25 percent pebbles, 35 percent cobbles; strongly acid (pH 5.4) clear wavy boundary. (6 to 10 inches thick)

    2C--9 to 60 inches; fractured hard igneous rock with large voids; distinct faint clay films and other soil material on upper surface of some rock fragments; few fine and very fine roots; soil material is moderately acid (pH 5.6).


TYPE LOCATION:  Phillips County, Montana; 2,100 feet south and 450 feet east of the NW corner of sec. 24, T. 25 N., R. 24 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil temperature - 40 to 45 degrees F.

Moisture control section - between 4 and 10 inches.


A horizon - Value:  4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist

Chroma:  2 or 3

Clay content:  20 to 27 percent

Rock fragments:  60 to 90 percent--25 to 35 percent pebbles, 35 to 60 percent cobbles

Reaction:  pH 6.1 to 6.5


Bw horizon - Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist

Chroma:  2 or 3

Clay content:  15 to 27 percent

Rock fragments:  60 to 90 percent--25 to 35 percent pebbles, 35 to 60 percent cobbles

Reaction:  pH 5.1 to 6.5


2C horizon - fragmental material consisting of angular igneous cobbles and pebbles.


COMPETING SERIES:

Brandenburg (ND) - neutral to slightly alkaline in the surface horizon above the fragmental material; formed in materials derived from porcelanite, argillites, or clinkers containing free carbonates.


GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - mountains.

Elevation - 4,600 to 5,600 feet.

Slope - 25 to 60 percent.

Parent material - colluvium or residuum from igneous rocks.

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm summers.

Mean annual precipitation - 18 to 24 inches.

Mean annual temperature - 38 to 43 degrees F.

Frost-free period - 70 to 100 days.


DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Excessively drained; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Landusky soils are used mainly for woodland and understory grazing.  The potential native vegetation is Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine, bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, common juniper, kinnikinnick, common snowberry, and common chokecherry.  Most areas of Landusky soils in the Little Rocky Mountains have been recently burned and have grassland vegetation or dense stands of lodgepole pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Landusky soils are of small extent in the Little Rocky Mountains in north-central Montana.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES PROPOSED:  Phillips County, Montana, 1994.  Landusky is the name of a small town in southwestern Phillips County.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1475.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches mixed (A, Bw horizons); a particle size control section from 10 to 40 inches (2C horizon).  Landusky soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
