LAMBETH SERIES

The Lambeth series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glaciofluvial, glaciolacustrine, or eolian material; or colluvium from weakly consolidated sedimentary bedrock.  These soils are on alluvial fans, escarpments, hills, and relict stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid Aridic Ustorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lambeth silt loam, rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 4 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) silt loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; weak thin platy structure parting to weak very fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; disseminated lime; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick)

    By1--4 to 12 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) silt loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; weak thin and medium platy structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine pores; many seams and masses of gypsum; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); diffuse wavy boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick)

    By2--12 to 60 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 7/4) silt loam with laminations of silty clay loam and very fine sandy loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; thin and medium platy structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few fine and very fine pores; plates or bands are 2 to 5 mm thick; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) and reddish brown (5YR 3/3) mottles along lamination planes; few fine seams and masses of gypsum; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Cascade County, Montana; about 520 feet east and 2,780 feet north of the southwest corner of sec. 10, T. 22 N., R. 5 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil temperature - 42 to 47 degrees F.

Moisture control section - between 4 and 12 inches, dry in all parts between four-tenths and five-tenths of the cumulative days per year when the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees or higher.

The bedrock substratum phase of this series will be a new series when recognized in future mapping.  It has weakly consolidated sedimentary beds at a depth of 40 inches and deeper.


A horizon - Hue:  10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y

Value:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist

Chroma:  2, 3, or 4

Texture:  silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam

Clay content:  20 to 35 percent

Calcium carbonate equivalent:  1 to 10 percent

Effervescence:  slight to violently

Reaction:  pH 6.6 to 8.4


By1 and By2 horizon - Hue:  10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y

Value:  5, 6, or 7 dry; 4, 5, or 6 moist

Chroma:  2, 3, or 4

Texture:  silt loam or silty clay loam with thin bands of loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam

Clay content:  20 to 35 percent

Gypsum:  1 to 6 percent

Calcium carbonate equivalent:  5 to 15 percent

Effervescence:  strongly or violently

Reaction:  pH 7.9 to 9.0

Bk or Bky horizons are allowed.  The bands are remnants from lacustrine sediments.


COMPETING SERIES:

Antwerp (MT) - has horizons of salt accumulation; does not have relict mottles.


GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - alluvial fans, escarpments, hills, and stream terraces.

Elevation -  2,200 to 4,500 feet.

Slopes - 0 to 70 percent.

Parent material - glaciofluvial, glaciolacustrine, or eolian material; or colluvium from semiconsolidated sedimentary bedrock.

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers.

Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 14 inches.

Mean annual temperature - 40 to 45 degrees F.

Frost-free period - 100 to 135 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Lambeth soils are used mainly as rangeland.  A few areas are used for dryland and irrigated crops.  Potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, western wheatgrass, green needlegrass, and needleandthread.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Lambeth soils are of moderate extent in the west-central part of Montana.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Carbon County (Bridger area), Montana, 1971.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT0107, MT0203.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches (mixed) (A, By1 horizons); horizons with concentrations of gypsum from 4 to 60 inches (By1, By2 horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (By1, By2 horizons).  Lambeth soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
