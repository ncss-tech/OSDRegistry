LEGRAY SERIES

The Legray series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granitoid and/or sedimentary rock. The Legray soils are on hillslopes. Slope is 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 203 mm (8 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C (64 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Tugas (MLRA 42B) series. Tugas soils do not receive significant amounts of winter precipitation and have most of the rainfall occurring as high-intensity, convective thunderstorms from midspring to mid autumn.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Legray soils are on hillslopes. Slope is 15 to 50 percent. Legray soils formed in alluvium derived from granitoid and/or sedimentary rock. Elevations are 144 to 447 meters (470 to 1,465 feet). The climate is arid with hot dry summers and cool, somewhat moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 152 to 203 mm (6 to 8 inches). The mean annual air temperature is 16 to 18 degrees C (61 to 64 degrees F). Mean July temperature is about 29 degrees C (85 degrees F), and mean January temperature is about 8 degrees C (47 degrees F). The frost-free season is 240 to 300 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Elkhills, Hillbrick, and the Pyxo series. Elkhills soils on uplands have a coarse-loamy particle-size class and a calcareous mineralogy class. Hillbrick soils on foothills and mountains, are shallow, and have a loamy particle-size class and a calcareous mineralogy class. Pyxo soils on hills and mountains are moderately deep and have a coarse-loamy particle-size class.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; rapid to very rapid runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Legray soils are used for livestock grazing and oil production. Native vegetation is red brome, redstem filaree, bladder pod, perennial buckwheat, allscale saltbush, snakeweed, wild oats, and schismus.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Among the Buena Vista hills and other hills arising out of the Buena Vista Lakebed of the Southern San Joaquin Valley of California, MLRA 17.  The series is not extensive.
