LEVELLAND SERIES

The Levelland series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in loamy reworked alluvial sediments of Quaternary age. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on ephemeral streams on draws. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 483 mm (19 in), and mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (60 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, nonacid, thermic Aridic Ustifluvents

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the similar Bippus, Gomez, Hindman, and Sprone series and also the Amarillo, Brownfield, Midessa, Patricia, Posey, and Potter series. 
Bippus and Sprone soils are on similar landscape positions. 
Amarillo, Brownfield, and Patricia soils are on higher landscape positions. 
Gomez soils are on slightly higher landscape positions. 
Hindman soils are on similar landscape positions. 
Midessa and Posey soils are on slightly higher landscape positions and have 18 to 35 percent silicate clay in the particle-size control section. 
Potter soils are on higher landscape positions and have carbonatic mineralogy. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained and moderately rapid permeability. Surface runoff is negligible on 0 to 2 percent slopes. These soils are occasionally flooded for very brief periods. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Dominantly native pasture or range; some areas are cultivated to cotton, grain sorghums, and wheat. Native vegetation is little bluestem, switchgrass, vine-mesquite, sideoats grama, blue grama, buffalograss, western wheatgrass, bundleflower, engelmanndaisy, prairie clovers, hackberry, elm, and wild plum. Widely spaced mesquite and cacti are sometimes present. This soil has been correlated to the Draw (077CY023TX) range site in MLRA-77. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern High Plains of western Texas and eastern New Mexico (sub-MLRA-77C). The series is of minor extent.
