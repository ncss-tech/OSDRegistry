LIENDRE SERIES

The Liendre series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly or moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium from sandstone and shale. Liendre soils occur on fan remnants along the baseline of Rocky Mountain foothills as they transition to the Great Plains. Slope ranges from 3 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 420 mm and mean annual soil temperature is about 11.6 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Liendre soils occur on alluvial fan remnants originating at the baseline of the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. These fans are relatively steep, ranging from 3 to 8 percent in slope. Soils on these landforms contain coarse rounded to sub-rounded sandstone fragments (gravels and cobbles) which are evidence of their historical relationship to higher energy flood and stream deposits. The parent materials are derived from mostly sandstones and shales of the Raton, Vermejo, and Trinidad Formations with fragments mostly representing the sandstone but the fines being derived from sediment packages of either or both rock types. These fan remnants descend to, and are dissected by, modern drainageways and streams. The location of these fans, adjacent to the mountain front, causes them to be bracketed on the uphill side by landslide deposits, and on the downslope side by either lower relief fans or plateau interfluves.
Slope range: from 0 to 3 percent but can be as high as 8 percent along terrace risers. 
Mean annual precipitation range: from 381 to 457 mm (15 to 18 in.)
Mean annual soil temperature range: from 9.4 to 14.4 degrees C (49 to 58 degrees F)
Mean annual air temperature range: from 8.3 to 12.8 degrees C (47 to 57 degrees F.) 
The frost-free season range: from 130 to 175 days 
Elevation range: from 1828 to 2133 m (6,000 to 7,000 feet)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the La Brier, Sapello and Philmont series, all of which have mollic epipedons. The La Brier and Sapello soils are located on ephemeral drainageways. Philmont soils are comingled on fan remnant positions and also adjacent plateau interfluves and are in a fine family class.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderate. Runoff is medium on slopes less than 5 percent, high on steeper slopes. Wind erosivity is high when surface fragments are below 5 percent, moderate at higher surface fragment cover. 
USE AND VEGETATION: Principal use is for dryland and irrigated cropland and pasture. This series is correlated to the Loamy Uplands ecosite GX070A01X003. However, due to its position in the landscape (high in elevation and exposed to cold air drainage from the Rocky Mountains), this soil occurs at the cooler end of the ecological range where the lower limit of frost-free days occurs within the LRU. Therefore, expect a higher occurrence of cool season plants such as western wheatgrass and bottlebrush squirreltail, and a corresponding decrease in warm season species, particularly broom snakeweed. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern New Mexico, LRR G, in MLRA 70A along the Canadian Plateaus of the Southwestern Great Plains; LRU 70A.1 (Canadian Plateaus). The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona.

Soils updated to the Liendre series were formerly correlated to a soil somewhat between the Berthoud and Mughouse series previously mapped in similar landscape positions. These soils were borrowed from other MLRAs well outside of the range of characteristics. This series was updated to reflect the unique characteristics corresponding to MLRA 70A soil properties.
