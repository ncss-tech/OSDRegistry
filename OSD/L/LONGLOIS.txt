LONGLOIS SERIES

The Longlois series consists of very deep, well drained soils that are deep to calcareous, stratified sandy and gravelly outwash. Longlois soils formed in loess and in the underlying loamy and gravelly outwash. They are on terraces, outwash plains, kames, and eskers. Slope ranges from 2 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Mollic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Longlois silt loam, on a convex, 4 percent slope in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 3Bt5--89 to 109 cm (35 to 43 inches); dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) very gravelly sandy clay loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few very fine roots; common very fine pores; thin continuous dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) clay films on faces of peds; 40 percent rock fragments; strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary. [Combined thickness of the 3Bt horizon is 51 to 76 cm (20 to 30 inches).]

 3BCt--109 to 137 cm (43 to 54 inches); dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) very gravelly sandy clay loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few very fine roots; thin continuous dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) clay films on faces of peds; 40 percent rock fragments; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. [8 to 38 cm (3 to 15 inches)]

 3C--137 to 152 cm (54 to 60 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly loamy coarse sand with strata of sand; single grain; loose; 35 percent rock fragments; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Tippecanoe County, Indiana; about 2 1/2 miles south of Elston; 1,640 feet west and 1,960 feet north of the southeast corner of sec. 18, T. 22 N., R. 4 W.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Dunbridge, Falleaf, Lauramie, Lydick, Mohawk, Oneco, Pana, and Razort series. Dunbridge and Oneco soils have a lithic contact at depths of less than 152 cm (60 inches). Falleaf, Lauramie, and Mohawk soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Lydick soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the argillic horizon. Pana soils are in areas where the mean annual temperature is greater than 11.1 degrees C (52 degrees F). Razort soils do not have carbonates in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Longlois soils are on terraces, outwash plains, kames, and eskers of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 2 to 6 percent. The soils formed in as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of loess and in the underlying loamy and gravelly outwash. They are deep to calcareous, stratified sandy and gravelly outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 965 mm (35 to 38 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.0 to 11.1 degrees C (50 to 52 degrees F). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bowes, Lafayette, Mahalasville, and Waupecan soils. The Bowes and Waupecan soils have less sand in the upper part of the control section, and are on less sloping areas. The somewhat poorly drained Lafayette soils are on toe slopes and in slight depressions. The very poorly drained Mahalasville soils are in drainageways and depressions. Where Mahalasville soils are mapped in association with Longlois soils, they have gravelly substrata.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Potential for surface runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the subsoil and very high in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate in the subsoil and very rapid in the underlying material. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used to grow corn and soybeans. Winter wheat is the principal small grain. Native vegetation is predominantly prairie grasses with mixed hardwood trees and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 111C and 111D in west-central Indiana. The type location is in MLRA 111D. The series is of small extent.
