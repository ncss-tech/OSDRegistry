LOSTFOREST SERIES

The Lostforest series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and slope alluvium derived from tuff and tuff-breccia.  Lostforest soils are on structural benches. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are currently no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lostforest soils are on structural benches. They formed in volcanic ash and slope alluvium derived from basaltic tuff and tuff-breccia. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Elevations range from 1,310 to 1,435 meters. The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250  mm, with an annual snowfall of about 530 mm. The mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C. The frost-free period is 50 to 80 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Morehouse, Puzzlebark, and Sandrock soils. Morehouse soils are ashy, very deep, do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons, and occur on stable dunes and sand sheets. Puzzlebark soils are ashy, have cambic horizons, and are shallow to thin duripans over lithic contacts. Sandrock soils are ashy, have argillic horizons, and are shallow to lithic contacts. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium surface runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Lostforest soils are used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and recreation. The present vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, Thurber's needlegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, and Sandberg's bluegrass with scattered western juniper and ponderosa pine. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Oregon. These soils are not extensive with about 2,500 acres of the series mapped to date. MLRA 23.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (A1 and A2 horizons and part of the Bw horizon). 
Cambic horizon - The zone from 13 to 56 cm (Bw, 2Bk, and 2Bqk horizons). 
Vitrandic intergrade feature - The zone from the soil surface to 56 cm (A1, A2, Bw, 2Bk, and 2Bqk horizons). 
Identifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 28 to 56 cm (2Bk and 2Bqk horizons). 
Durinodes - The zone from 46 to 56 cm (2Bqk horizon). 
Lithic contact - The boundary at 56 cm to underlying hard bedrock (3R layer). 
Particle-size control section and ashy substitute class with glassy mineralogy - The zone from 25 to 56 cm (2Bk and 2Bqk horizons and part of the Bw horizon). 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Volcanic glass percentages in the sand fraction determined locally by optical grain count using a polarizing petrographic microscope. Temperature and precipitation means based on climate data observed at the Silver Lake Ranger Station located 40 miles southwest of the Lost Forest Research Natural Area (43 degrees, 7 minutes N, 121 degrees, 4 minutes W; 1,335 meters elevation) between 1953 and 1999.
