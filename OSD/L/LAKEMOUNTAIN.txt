LAKEMOUNTAIN SERIES

The Lakemountain series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from quartzite. These soils are on ridges , hillslopes and mountain slopes. Slopes are 5 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 550 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 0.8 degrees C.
