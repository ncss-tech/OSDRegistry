REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizon and other features in this pedon
*Ochric epipedon
*Cambic horizon--23 to 102 cm
*Secondary carbonates--zone from 23 to 150 cm
*Silica accumulation--zone from 23 to 150 cm
*Particle-size control section--zone from 25 to 100 cm

12/2006--Classification changed from fine-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Durinodic Xerorthents to fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Calcic Haploxerepts because of the presence of a cambic horizon.

The criteria for the calcic subgroup was met by the presence of identifiable secondary carbonates within a depth of 112 cm and the absence of a calcic horizon.

6/2016--This official series description (OSD) was updated as part of the final correlation of the Spokane County, Washington, soil survey. The formatting was updated according to SSR1 Technical Note 11--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015).
