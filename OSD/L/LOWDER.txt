LOWDER SERIES 

The Lowder series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium and alpine glacial till from hard fine grained igneous and metamorphic rocks.  These soils are on alluvial fans, moraines, swales and flood plain steps.  Slopes are 2 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained, moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Lowder soils are primarily used for timber production, wildlife habitat and for watershed.  The potential native vegetation is mainly lodgepole pine, subalpine fir, quaking aspen, Engelmann spruce, Rocky Mountain juniper, tall sedges, starry false solomonseal, western meadowrue, buttercup, strawberry, clover, prickly current, Kentucky bluegrass, sedges, iris and shrubby cinquefoil. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Lowder soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.
