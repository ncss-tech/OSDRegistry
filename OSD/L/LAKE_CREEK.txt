LAKE CREEK SERIES

The Lake Creek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone, shale, and argillite.  Lake Creek soils occur on uplands, hillslopes, mountain slopes, and landslide deposits.  Slopes are 15 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lake Creek loam-woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; undecomposed needles, bark, and twigs.

    Oe--2 to 3 inches; partially decomposed organic material.

    A--3 to 4 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable; slightly acid (pH 6.5); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 3 inches thick)

    E--4 to 9 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderate fine platy structure parting to fine granular; vesicular; soft, very friable; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

    Bt1--9 to 23 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very stony clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable; continuous faint clay films on faces of peds and rock fragments; 50 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.5); gradual smooth boundary. (7 to 20 inches thick)

    Bt2--23 to 33 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely stony loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; common faint clay films on faces of peds; 70 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 13 inches thick)

    R--33 inches; sandstone, partly fractured and weathered but containing less than 5 percent fine materials; very weakly calcareous in places.  (Several feet thick)

TYPE LOCATION:  Sheridan County, Wyoming; near the southwest corner of sec. 14, T. 56 N., R. 89 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from 15 to 35 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lake Creek soils occur on uplands, hillslopes, mountain slopes, and landslide deposits at elevations of 4,500 to 7,200 feet.  Slopes are 15 to 60 percent.  They formed in colluvium and residuum from sandstone, shale, and argillite.  Annual precipitation is 16 to 24 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 34 to 41 degrees F.  The average summer temperature is 54 degrees F.  Frost free season is 50 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Nielsen, Passcreek, and Woodrock soils.  Nielsen and Passcreek soils do not have E horizons and are on ridges and mountain slopes.  Woodrock soils have a fine-loamy control section and are on hills, ridges and mountain slopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately permeable.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for timber production and grazing.  Vegetation is Douglas-fir, spruce, and lodgepole pine with an understory of grasses and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Wyoming, Central Montana, and north-central Colorado.  The series is of moderate extent.  MLRAs 34A, 43B, 44B, 48A.
