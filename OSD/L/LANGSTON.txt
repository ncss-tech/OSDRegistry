LANGSTON SERIES

The Langston series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium over lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Langston soils are on fan remnants and lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Haplargids 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Langston gravelly loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    A--0 to 10 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate thin platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 25 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 20 cm thick)

    Bt1--10 to 38 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine interstitial and common very fine tubular pores; common faint and few distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 30 thick)

    Bt2--38 to 51 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; few faint clay bridges between sand grains; 30 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 15 cm thick)

    2C--51 to 102 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) extremely gravelly sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; common faint clay films lining pores and few faint clay bridges between sand grains; 80 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (25 to 56 cm thick)

    2Ck--102 to 152 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; violently effervescent, with few carbonate coats on bottoms of some rock fragments; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Langston soils are on fan remnants and lake terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium over lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,310 to 1,865 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual air temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 110 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the McConnel, Old Camp, Pegler, and Vylach soils. McConnel soils do not have argillic horizons.  Old Camp soils are shallow over hard bedrock. Pegler soils are shallow over soft tuff.  Vylach soils are shallow over a strongly cemented duripan. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; low or medium surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Langston soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, spiny hopsage, bluebunch wheatgrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Nevada and northeastern California.  These soils are moderately extensive.  The series concept and main acreage is in MLRA 23, while other acreage occurs in MLRA 27.
