LONESOME SERIES

The Lonesome series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or eolian material over till, glaciofluvial or glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on till plains, stream terraces and dunes.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy over loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid Aridic Ustorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lonesome loamy fine sand, in cropland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

    A--0 to 5 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 7 inches thick)

    Bw--5 to 15 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (9 to 29 inches thick)

    Bk1--15 to 30 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loamy fine sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; few fine seams of lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 16 inches thick)

    2Bk2--30 to 51 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine pores; common fine masses and seams of lime; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 22 inches thick)

    2Bk3--51 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; common fine masses of lime; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  Hill County, Montana; 1,400 feet south and 1,400 feet west of the NE corner of sec. 11, T. 36 N., R. 14 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil temperature - 44 to 47 degrees F.

Moisture control section - between 12 and 35 inches; dry in all parts between four-tenths and five-tenths of the cumulative days per year when the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F or higher.

Depth to 2Bk2 horizon - 20 to 40 inches, mainly 24 to 38 inches.


Ap horizon - Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y

Value:  4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist

Chroma:  2, 3, or 4

Clay content:  5 to 15 percent

Rock fragments:  0 to 2 percent pebbles

Reaction:  pH 6.6 to 7.8

Some pedons contain A2 horizons 3 to 6 inches thick which, when combined with the A horizon, meet all the requirements for a mollic epipedon except for organic matter content.  The A2 horizon has a loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or fine sand texture.


Bw horizon - Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y

Value:  5 or 6 dry; 3 to 5 moist

Chroma:  3 or 4

Texture:  loamy fine sand, loamy sand or fine sand

Clay content:  5 to 15 percent

Rock fragments:  0 to 2 percent

Reaction:  pH 6.6 to 7.8


Bk1 horizon - Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y

Value:  5 or 6 dry; 3 to 5 moist

Chroma:  3 or 4

Texture:  loamy fine sand, loamy sand or fine sand

Clay content:  5 to 15 percent

Rock fragments:  0 to 2 percent

Calcium carbonate equivalent:  5 to 15 percent

Reaction:  pH 7.9 to 8.4


2Bk horizons - Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y

Value:  5 to 7 dry; 4 to 6 moist

Chroma:  2 to 4

Texture:  clay loam, loam or silty clay loam (contains less than 50 percent fine or coarser sand)

Clay content:  20 to 35 percent

Rock fragments:  0 to 5 percent

Calcium carbonate equivalent:  5 to 15 percent

EC:  0 to 4 mmhos/cm

SAR:  0 to 13

Reaction:  pH 7.9 to 9.0

Some pedons have a 2Bky horizon with 1 to 2 percent gypsum.  Some pedons have thin lenses of fine sandy loam or loam textures between thicker layers of loam or clay loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - till plains; stream terraces; dunes.

Elevations - 2,700 to 3,500 feet.

Slopes - 0 to 8 percent.

Parent material - alluvium or eolian material over till, glaciofluvial or glaciolacustrine deposits.

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; hot, dry summers.

Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 14 inches, most of which falls during spring and early summer.

Mean annual air temperature - 42 to 45 degrees F.

Frost-free period - 105 to 125 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chinook, Fortbenton, Lihen and Yetull soils.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; rapid permeability above the 2Bk2 horizon and slow in the 2Bk2 and below.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Lonesome soils are used as nonirrigated cropland and rangeland.  The potential plant community is prairie sandreed, Indian ricegrass, needleandthread and sand dropseed.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Lonesome soils are of small extent in north-central Montana.
