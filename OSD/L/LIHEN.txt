LIHEN SERIES

The Lihen series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively or well drained soils that formed in sandy alluvium, glaciofluvial, and eolian deposits that are in places over till or sedimentary bedrock.  These soils are on stream terraces, dunes, sedimentary plains, and till plains.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, frigid Entic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lihen sandy loam, 2 percent slopes, in grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

    A1--0 to 4 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; many fine and medium tubular pores; 2 percent pebbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.

    A2--4 to 9 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; common fine pores and few medium pores; 10 percent pebbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.

    A3--9 to 24 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loamy sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; single grain; loose, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; few pores; 10 percent pebbles; few calcium carbonate cutans on lower surfaces of pebbles; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (Combined A horizons 20 to 40 inches thick)

    Bk--24 to 32 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) sand, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few roots; 10 percent pebbles; common calcium carbonate cutans on lower surfaces of pebbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 44 inches thick)

    C--32 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) sand, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few roots; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively or well drained; rapid permeability; runoff is negligible or low.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Lihen soils are used mainly as rangeland.  Few areas are used for nonirrigated crops.  The potential native vegetation is mainly needleandthread, prairie sandreed, Indian ricegrass, and little bluestem.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern and northern Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota.  Lihen soils are moderately extensive.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT0012. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 24 inches (A1, A2 and A3 horizons); accumulation of secondary carbonates from 24 to 32 inches (Bk horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (A3, Bk and C horizons).  Lihen soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
