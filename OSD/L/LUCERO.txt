LUCERO SERIES

The Lucero series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed igneous and sedimentary rocks. Lucero soils occur on fan remnants, hills, and mountain slopes. Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches (33 cm) and the mean annual temperature is 47 degrees F (8 degrees C).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Calcic Argixerolls

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Colockum (WA), Doyce (UT), Hack (OR), Pollynot (ID), Timpanogos (UT), and Tirod (ID) series. Colockum soils have a lithologic discontinuity at 47 inches and are formed in loess and volcanic ash.  Doyce, Hack, and Tirod soils have 0 to 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Pollynot soils have a lithologic discontinuity at 44 inches of loamy fine sand.  Timpanogos soils have a water table at 40 to 60 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lucero soils occur on fan remnants, hills and mountain slopes.  Slope ranges from 2 to 40 percent. The aspect is variable and elevations range from 5,500 to 7,415 feet (1,676 to 2,260 meters). These soils formed in alluvium from mixed igneous and sedimentary rocks. The average annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches (304 to 356 mm).  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F (7 to 11 degrees C). The mean summer temperature is 69 to 70 degrees F (20.6 to 21.1 degrees C). The frost free period is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Motoqua, Pavant, Sevy and Taylorsflat soils. Motoqua soils have bedrock at depths of 10 to 20 inches and more than 35 percent rock fragments in the series control section. Pavant soils have a lime cemented hardpan at depths of 10 to 20 inches. Sevy and Taylorsflat soils do not have a mollic epipedon.  Taylorsflat soils do not have an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for rangeland, recreation and wildlife habitat.  The natural vegetation is dominantly pinyon, juniper, big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, squirreltail, hawksbeard, woody phlox and prairie junegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Utah. This series is not extensive. MLRA 28A.
