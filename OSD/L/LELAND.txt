LELAND SERIES

The Leland series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained and moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from sandstone, limestone, quartzite, and shale.  Leland soils are on low lake terraces.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

    2C3--38 to 58 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable; very fine pores; few fine faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation; strongly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  Weber County, Utah; about 1.75 miles west and 0.5 mile south of West Warren church; approximately 1,400 feet west of the east quarter corner of section 21, T. 6 N., R. 3 W.; USGS Ogden Bay 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; 41 degrees 14 minutes 35 seconds north latitude and 112 degrees 11 minutes 09 seconds west longitude, NAD83; UTM zone 12N 400632E, 4566410N, NAD83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Typically moist in winter and spring, dry in summer and fall; the soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for more than 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice; Xeric moisture regime that borders on aridic.

Mean annual soil temperature - 47 to 54 degrees F.

Ochric epipedon thickness - 4 to 8 inches.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 24 to 32 percent.


E horizon - Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3 dry.
Texture: Silt loam or silty clay loam.
Structure: Weak to moderate, thin to thick platy.
Exchangeable sodium: 8 to 25 percent.


Btkn horizons - Value: 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma: 3 or 4 dry.
Texture: Clay loam, loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam; some pedons have silty clay loam.
Clay content: Less than 35 percent.
Sand content: More than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.
Structure: Moderate to strong columnar.
Reaction: Strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline (up to pH 9.6).
Sodicity (SAR): 13 to 60.
Exchangeable sodium: 35 to 90 percent.

Exchangeable sodium: 35 to 90 percent 
Reaction: pH 9.3 to 10.2.
Redox features: Distinct masses of iron accumulation occur between 23 and 31 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Stockdrive series.  Stockdrive soils have accumulation of secondary silica with very weak cementation, a perched water table at a half foot above to one foot below the soil surface from March to May, and do not have albic horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Leland soils are on low lake terraces.  These soils formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sedimentary rocks such as sandstone and limestone and metamorphic rocks such as quartzite.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 18 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is 65 to 72 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 120 to 165 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Croy, Saltair, Syracuse, and Warm Springs soils.  Croy soils are moderately deep to thin duripans.  Saltair soils are fine-silty and have salic horizons.  Syracuse soils are coarse-loamy and have mollic epipedons.  Warm Springs soils have mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly and moderately well drained; medium surface runoff; slow permeability (moderately low or moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity).  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 2.5 and 4.0 feet (moderately deep or deep free water occurrence classes) between April and September.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Leland soils are used mainly as rangeland and provides grazing primarily in early spring.  Some areas have been partially reclaimed and produce irrigated pasture, small grains, alfalfa, and sugar beets.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Utah.  These soils are not extensive with about 7,600 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 28A.

Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 8 inches (E horizon).

Albic horizon - The zone from the soil surface to 8 inches (E horizon).

Natric horizon - The zone from 8 to 19 inches (Btkn1 and Btkn2 horizons).

Calcic horizon - The zone from 8 to 19 inches (Btkn1 and Btkn2 horizons).

Endosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 30 and 48 inches at certain times during normal years (parts of the C1, C2, and C3 horizons).

Particle-size control section - The zone from 8 to 19 inches (Btkn1 and Btkn2 horizons).  


The revision of April 2005 updated the taxonomic class from Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Natrustalfs based on the assumed moisture regime being xeric instead of ustic.

The superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has partial characterization data by the Soils Laboratory from Utah State University (USU) Logan, UT and is published on pages 140-141, Table 11 of the Soil Survey of Davis-Weber Area, Utah.  The pH values in the typical pedon are from saturated paste.
