LINKLETTER SERIES

The Linkletter series consists of deep to a duripan, well drained soils on rounded hills and high terraces.  They formed in older alluvium that has some loess influence.  Permeability is slow.  Slopes are 8 to 25 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Duric Xeric Petroargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Linkletter gravelly loam on an 8 percent slightly convex northwest facing slope at an elevation of 3,500 feet in rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Buncelvoir (T), Diaz (T), Dryvalley (T), Farmell, Glasgow, Lanktree, Oppio, Risley, Schamp, and Trunk series.  Buncelvoir soils have a calcic horizon.  Diaz, Glasgow, Oppio, Risley, and Trunk soils have bedrock above 40 inches.  Dryvalley soils lack secondary carbonate accumulations.  Farmwell soils lack a duripan.  Lanktree soils have an E horizon and lack a duripan.  Schamp soils lack a duripan and are strongly or very strongly alkaline in the Bk horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Linkletter soils are on rounded hills and terraces.   Slopes range from 8 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in older alluvium that has some loess influence in the upper part.  Elevation ranges from 3,400 to 3,900 feet.   The average annual precipitation is 9 to 11 inches, including 1.5 to 3 feet of snowfall and the average annual temperature is 48 to 51 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chilcott, Elijah, Purdam, and Vickery soils.   Chilcott, Elijah, Purdam, and Vickery soils have a duripan above 40 inches.  These soils are on landscape positions similar to the Linkletter soil.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for rangeland.  The dominant native plant community is Wyoming big sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The series is located in southcentral Idaho.  The series has limited  extent.
