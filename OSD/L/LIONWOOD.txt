LIONWOOD SERIES 

The Lionwood series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on lake plains and terraces in valleys. Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Vitrandic Hapludalfs

USE AND VEGETATION:  Lionwood soils are used mainly for cropland, woodland, understory grazing and wildlife habitat. Potential native vegetation is mainly Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, western larch, lodgepole pine, grand fir, and western white pine. Understory vegetation is mainly brackenfern, pinegrass, common snowberry, oceanspray, and other forbs and shrubs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Lionwood soils are of small extent in the valleys of northwestern Montana.
