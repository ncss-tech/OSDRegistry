LAHOOD SERIES

The Lahood series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in local alluvium, colluvium, or residuum over sandstone or fine grained igneous rock.  These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans, ridges and sideslopes of hills and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lahood loam, 2 to 8 percent slope, rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 3 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 5 inches thick)

    Bw--3 to 11 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium and coarse prismatic structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine and very fine roots; common fine pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 9 inches thick)

    Bk1--11 to 22 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; few to common fine pores; 10 percent pebbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear way boundary. (8 to 14 inches thick)

    Bk2--22 to 36 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few to common fine and very fine roots; few fine pores; 25 percent pebbles; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6). (4 to 15 inches thick)

    R--36 inches; hard coarse grained sandstone.

Rhame (ND) - moderately deep to a paralithic contact.

Tinytown (CO) - 5YR and redder cambic horizons; does not have carbonates above a depth of 40 inches.

Ynot (MT) - is very deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landforms - stream terraces, alluvial fans, ridges and sideslopes of hills and mountains.

Elevation - 3,500 to 5,500 feet.

Slope - 2 to 45 percent.

Parent material - local alluvium, colluvium or in residuum over sandstone, or igneous intrusive rock.

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers.

Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 14 inches, much of which falls as snow and spring rain.

Mean annual air temperature - 39 to 45 degrees F.

Frost-free period - 90 to 115 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Lahood soils are used mainly as rangeland.  The potential native vegetation is bluebunch wheatgrass, needleandthread, green needlegrass, and big sagebrush.  A few areas have thin noncommercial stands of limber pine and Douglas fir.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Lahood soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Jefferson County, Montana, 1998.  

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1207, MT1208.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 11 inches (A, Bw horizons); an accumulation of carbonates from 22 to 36 inches (Bk1, Bk2 horizon); hard sandstone or volcanic rock at a depth of 36 inches; a particle-size control section from 10 to 36 inches (Bw, Bk1, Bk2 horizons).  Lahood soils have a frigid temperature regime and ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
