LITTLE WHITE SERIES

The Little White series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of sandy or loamy eolian or glaciolacustrine deposits underlain by clayey glaciolacustrine deposits. These soils are on glacial lake plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 685 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy over clayey, isotic over mixed, superactive, nonacid, frigid Aquic Udorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Little White loamy sand on a slight convex rise of 2 percent, in a wooded area, on a glacial lake plain, at an elevation of about 400 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 8 centimeters; black (10YR 2/1) loamy sand, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; moderate fine and medium granular structure; very friable; many fine and medium roots; moderately acid; abrupt wavy boundary. (8 to 15 centimeters thick)

    E--8 to 10 centimeters; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loamy sand, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) dry; weak fine platy structure; loose; common fine and medium roots; moderately acid; abrupt wavy boundary. (2 to 10 centimeters thick)

    Bw1--10 to 25 centimeters; olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) loamy sand; common medium distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; single grain; very friable; common very fine and fine roots; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary.

    Bw2--25 to 64 centimeters; olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) loamy sand; common medium distinct grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) redoximorphic depletions; single grain; very friable; common very fine and fine roots; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bw horizons is 51 to 102 centimeters.)

    2Cg1--64 to 127 centimeters; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay; massive; firm; few very fine roots; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.

    2Cg2--127 to 152 centimeters; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay; massive; firm; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.

    2Cg3--152 to 203 centimeters; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay; massive; friable; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--sandy or loamy eolian deposits or glaciolacustrine deposits and the underlying by clayey glaciolacustine deposits
Landform--slight convex rises on glacial lake plains
Slope--1 to 3 percent
Elevation--350 to 490 meters above sea level
Mean annual air temperature--3 to 5 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation--635 to 711 millimeters
Frost-free period--115 to 125 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Joki and McDavitt soils. These soils form a hydrosequence with the Little White soils.
Joki--are on lower lying and generally less sloping positions on the landscape and have a frequently saturated zone as shallow as 0.15 meter below the surface during the wettest periods of normal years
McDavitt--are in drainageways and depressions and are ponded during the wettest period of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30-year mean of annual precipitation

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--somewhat poorly drained--these soils have a seasonal high zone of saturation as high as 0.30 meter below the surface during the wettest periods of normal years
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--1.00 to 100.00 micrometers per second in the sandy or loamy eolian or glaciolacustrine deposits and 0.01 to 0.10 micrometers per second in the underlying clayey deposits

USE AND VEGETATION: More than half the extent of these soils is forested and the other areas are cleared and used for hay or pasture.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Physiographic Division--Interior Plains or Laurentian Upland
Physiographic Province--Central Lowland or Superior Upland
Physiographic section--Western Lake section (if in the Central Lowland Province) or undefined (if in the Superior Upland)
MLRA--Northern Minnesota Glacial Lake Basins (88)
LRR K; northern Minnesota
Extent--small
