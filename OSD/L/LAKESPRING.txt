LAKESPRING SERIES

The Lakespring series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in formed in laminated Latah formation, glaciolacustrine deposits, and complex landslide deposits mixed with loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. Lakespring soils are on outwash plains and lake terraces and convex footslopes and backslopes of foothills. Slopes are 0 to 25 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Kephart and Mcgowan series. Kephart soils are more than 60 inches deep and are dry for 90 to 130 days. McGowan soils are more than 60 inches deep and are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lakespring soils are on outwash plains, outwash terraces, and relict glacial lake terraces at elevations of 1,800 to 2,600 feet. Slopes are 0 to 25 percent. These soils formed in laminated Latah formation, glaciolacustrine deposits, and complex landslide deposits mixed with loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. The climate is temperate continental with dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches. The mean annual temperature is about 45 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free season is 100 to 130 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Glenrose, Speigle, Spokane, Kramerhill and Uhlig soils. Glenrose soils are very deep, have a mollic epipedon and are on foothills and outwash plains. Speigle soils are very deep, loamy-skeletal and are on basalt plateaus. Spokane soils are coarse-loamy, have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches and are on foothills, mountains and ridgetops. Kramerhill soils are fine-loamy, 40 to 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact, and are on convex footslopes and backslopes of mountains and foothills. Uhlig soils are coarse-loamy, very deep, and are on outwash terraces. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. A perched water table is present December through April. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing, non-irrigated cropland, hay and pasture, home sites, and wildlife habitat. Potential natural vegetation is mainly ponderosa pine with very scattered Douglas-fir, with an understory of redstem ceanothus, mallow ninebark, common snowberry, Saskatoon serviceberry, creeping Oregon grape, baldhip rose, and bluebunch wheatgrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern Washington and possibly northern Idaho. Series is of moderate extent. MLRA 44A.
