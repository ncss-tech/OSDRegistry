LACOTA SERIES

The Lacota series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils that formed in loamy deposits underlain by sandy materials. Lacota soils are on lake plains, outwash plains, and glacial drainageways. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, semiactive, frigid Typic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Lacota loam with a slope of 1 percent on a lake plain in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated)

 Ap--0 to 20 cm (8 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; moderate medium granular structure; friable; many roots; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [18 to 25 cm (7 to 10 inches) thick]

 Bg1--20 to 41 cm (8 to 16 inches); gray (10YR 5/1) clay loam; moderate medium angular blocky structure; firm; many roots; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; neutral; gradual wavy boundary.

 Bg2--41 to 81 cm (16 to 32 inches); gray (10YR 5/1) clay loam; moderate coarse angular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots; common coarse distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) and prominent yellowish red (5YR 4/6) masses of oxidized iron; slightly alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bg horizon is 41 to 81 cm (16 to 32 inches).]

 2Cg--81 to 152 cm (32 to 60 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sand; single grain; loose; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Arenac County, Michigan; about 3 miles east of the village of Turner; 520 feet south and 300 feet west of the northeast corner of sec. 15, T. 20 N., R. 6 E.

Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: clay loam or silty clay loam
Surface features: some pedons have faint discontinuous clay films on faces of peds
Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline

2Cg horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 5 or 6
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: dominantly sand with some thin bands of loamy sand, sandy loam, coarse sand, or gravel
Reaction: neutral to moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Lacota soils are in nearly level to depressional areas on broad flats on lake plains and outwash plains, glacial drainageways, and areas of thin till deposits overlying outwash materials. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 838 mm (27 to 33 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 5.6 to 7.8 degrees C (42 to 46 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dighton, Epoufette, Hettinger, and Saganing soils. The well drained Dighton soils formed in similar materials and are associated with the Lacota soils on slightly higher landscape positions. The poorly drained or very poorly drained sandy Epoufette and Saganing soils and loamy Hettinger soils are associated on some lake plains.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained or very poorly drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and high or very high in the 2C horizon. Permeability is moderately slow in the solum and rapid in the 2C horizon.

USE AND VEGETATION: A small part is under cultivation to small grains and hay and some corn and beans. The greater part is permanent pasture or woodland. Native vegetation is chiefly oak, white ash, and red maple.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 94A in northern Michigan. The series is of small extent.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and properties recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 20 cm (8 inches) (Ap horizon).
Cambic horizon: from a depth of 20 to 81 cm (8 to 32 inches) (Bg1 and Bg2 horizon).
Aquic conditions: reduced matrix colors and redox concentrations in all horizons below the mollic epipedon.
