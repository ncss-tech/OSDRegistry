LEUPP SERIES

The Leupp series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed from residuum weathered from calcareous sandstone.  Leupp soils are on structural benches.   Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Lithic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Leupp sandy clay loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

 A--0 to 2 inches (0 to 5 cm); light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) sandy clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/3), moist; 22 percent clay; moderate medium platy structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic;  common fine roots; very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent channers; violently effervescent, 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline, pH 8.4; abrupt smooth boundary.

 C--2 to 5 inches (5 to 13 cm); reddish brown (5YR 4/4) channery loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4), moist; 18 percent clay; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots;  very fine vesicular pores; 25 percent channers; violently effervescent, 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline, pH 8.4; abrupt smooth boundary.

 R--5 inches (13 cm); unfractured, unweathered sandstone bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION: Soil Survey of Little Colorado River Area, Arizona, Parts of Coconino and Navajo Counties; USGS Quadrangle - Tucker Mesa NW; Geographic Coordinate System: 35 13' 18.50'' north, 110 58' 41.80'' west.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Soil moisture: Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July - September.  Driest during May and June.   Typic aridic soil moisture regime. 

Soil Temperature: 56 to 59 degrees Fahrenheit (13.1 to 15.0 degrees Celsius)

Particle-size control section:
Clay content: 18 to 35 percent

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Braf (UT), Casmos (UT), Farb (NM), Juanalo (CO), and Moenkopie (AZ).  Braf, Farb, and Moenkopie soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle control section.  Casmos soils have 10YR, 2.5Y and 5Y hues.  Juanalo soils have 10YR hues and cambic horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Leupp soils are on structural benches at elevations of 4,220 to 5,800 feet (1,285 to 1,768 meters).  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in residuum weathered from calcareous sandstone. The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches (152 to 254 millimeters) and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December and January. The mean annual air temperature is 54 to 57 degrees Fahrenheit (12.0 to 14.0 degrees Celsius).  The frost-free period is 150 to 180 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Epikom (AZ), Hoskinnini (UT), and Tsaya (UT) soils.  Epikom soils have a cambic horizon.  Hoskinnini soils have an argillic horizon.  Tsaya soils have a loamy skeletal particle size class.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Vegetation includes galleta, alkali sacaton, black grama, Bigelow sagebrush, blue grama, fourwing saltbush, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Arizona. Leupp soils are of moderate extent. This soil is named after a town near the type location.  MLRA is 35.
