LONGJOHN SERIES

The Longjohn series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived primarily from rhyolite.  Longjohn soils are on mountainsides with slopes of 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 800 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-skeletal, glassy Humic Vitricryands

TYPICAL PEDON: Longjohn gravelly coarse sandy loam, in forest on a 17 percent west facing slope.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

(25 to 50 cm thick)

    C1--64 to 109 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely cobbly coarse sandy loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) dry; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots and few fine and medium; many irregular pores; 5 percent stones, 25 percent cobbles, and 40 percent gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.3); gradual wavy boundary.  (38 to 76 cm thick)

     C2 --109 to 155 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely cobbly coarse sandy loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) dry; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few roots; many irregular pores; 15 percent stones, 35 percent cobbles, 30 percent gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.3);

TYPE LOCATION:  Lake County, Oregon; NE1/4, SE1/4 of section 6, T. 38 S., R. 22 E.; latitude 42 degrees 18 minutes 2 seconds N and longitude 120 degrees 9 minutes 40 seconds W; NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Soil moisture: Usually moist in the winter and spring and are dry for 30 to 45 consecutive days after the summer solstice.  
Mean annual soil temperature: 4 to 6 degrees C.  
Mean summer soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C. 
Base saturation; 5 to 20 percent. 
Bulk density: 0.85 to 0.95 grams per cubic centimeter.  
Depth to bedrock is 150 cm or more.
Reaction:  Very strongly acid or strongly acid.
Other features:    The very fine sand fraction contains 50 to 70 percent glass.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 2 to 10 percent.  
Rock fragments: Averages 35 to 60 percent.  Fragments are mainly rhyolite

A horizon
Value: 2 or 3 when moist and 4 or 5 when dry,.
Chroma: 2 or 3 when moist and 2 to 4 when dry.

Bw horizon
Value: 3 or 4 when moist and 5 or 6 when dry.
Chroma: 3 or 4 when moist and dry.  It is coarse sandy loam and sandy loam.  
Rock fragments: 35 to 60 percent of which 0 to 10 percent are cobbles and 35 to 50 percent are gravel.

C horizon
Value: 4 or 5 when moist and 6 or 7 when dry.
Chroma:3 or 4 when moist and dry.  
Rock fragments: 60 to 85 percent of which 20 to 35 percent are cobbles, 5 to 15 percent stones and 30 to 50 percent are gravel.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Castan and Edgewood series.  

Castin soils have a BC horizon with a base saturation of 50 to 80 percent.  Edgewood soils lack an umbic epipedon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Longjohn soils are on mountainsides at elevations of 2,075 to 2,565 meters.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived primarily from rhyolite.  The climate is cold and moist in winters and cool and dry in summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 760 to 860 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 4 to 5 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 20 to 50 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chocktoot, Drakespeak, Hallihan, Kittleson, and Twelvemile soils.  Chocktoot soils have mollic epipedons.  Drakespeak soils are loamy-skeletal.  Hallihan soils have a xeric soil moisture regime.  Kittleson soils are ashy.  Twelvemile soils have a frigid soil temperature regime.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The soils are forested and are used for watershed, wildlife habitat and recreation.  Vegetation is lodgepole pine, whitebark pine, western whitepine, white fir, wheeler bluegrass and longstolon sedge.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South central Oregon, MLRA 21.  The series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Lake County; Oregon; Southern Part; 1991.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Umbric  epipedon - The zone from 3 to 36 cm (A1, A2 and A3 horizons).
Cambic horizon - The zone from 36 to 64 cm (Bw horizon).
Particle-size control section  - The zone from 3 to 103 cm (A1, A2, A3, Bw and part of the C1 horizons).

Classification into Andisols is based on glass count data from the associated Twelvemile series.  
Phosphorous retention is assumed to be greater than 25 percent and the Al-Ox plus Fe-Ox is assumed to be greater than 0.4 percent.
The 15 bar water on air dried samples is 4 to 8 percent for the profile.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL data for four horizons (A2, A3, Bw, C1), S87OR-037-005;  Forest Service vegetative site CL-C1-12.
