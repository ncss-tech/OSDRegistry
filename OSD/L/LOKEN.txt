LOKEN SERIES

The Loken series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and residuum derived from limestone and calcareous shales. Loken soils are on upland fans and mountain slopes. Slopes are 2 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Loken silty clay loam, grassland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(3 to 7 inches thick)

    Bk2--15 to 27 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak medium and coarse prismatic structure parting to weak fine subangular blocky; very hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; 25 percent pebbles; common medium and fine soft masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); diffuse wavy boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick)

    Bk3--27 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and very fine roots in upper part of horizon grading to none in lower part; common fine and very fine pores in upper part grading to few very fine pores in the lower part; 25 percent pebbles; 5 percent cobbles; common medium and fine soft masses of lime throughout profile; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Litimber and Timberg series. Litimber soils have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR below the A horizon. Timberg soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Loken soils are on uplands, fans, and mountain slopes and have slope gradients of 2 to 45 percent. Elevations are 4,000 to 5,000 feet. Loken soils formed in clayey alluvium and residuum derived from lime- stone and calcareous shale. The climate is cool with long cold winters and moist springs and summers. Mean annual temperature is 40 to 43 degrees F. Average annual precipitation is 19 to 24 inches, most of which falls during spring and early summer. The growing season is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brazon, Judith, Maiden, Windham, and Winifred series. The Brazon soils are clayey-skeletal. The Judith, Maiden, and Windham soils contain less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control sections. The Winifred soils are moderately deep over shale.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to rapid runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for rangeland. To a lesser extent these soils are used for cropland and pasture. Native vegetation is mainly rough fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, green needlegrass, western wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, forbs, and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Loken soils are inextensive in the foothills area of central Montana.
