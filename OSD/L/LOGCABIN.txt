Haleycreek soils are well drained with a cobbly sandy loam surface texture, have a mollic epipedon, lacks a lithic contact, and occur on hillslopes of mountains and river valleys.
Stibnite soils are well drained, 15 to 35 cm (6 to 14 in) cambic horizon, and occur in til lplains, mountains, kames and kettles.
Tsina soils are well drained, do not have umbric epipedons, and occur on mountain slopes above 800 m (2600ft) elevation.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class: poorly
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: high in the Oi, Oi2 and 2Ab horizons, moderately high in the A and 2Bg horizon, low in the 2Cf horizon
