LEDGEHOLLOW SERIES

The Ledgehollow series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in alluvium over weakly consolidated ash, tuffaceous siltstone or tuffaceous sandstone.  These soils are in concave saddle positions on summits and on shoulders and backslopes of hills.  Permeability is moderately slow. Slopes are 5 to 40 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.   

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy, mixed, superactive, shallow Xeric Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ledgehollow gravelly loam, in rangeland; on an 8 percent slope at an elevation of 6,750 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 4 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and few medium and coarse roots; 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 5 inches thick)

    Bt1--4 to 9 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium and coarse roots; few faint discontinuous clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 8 inches thick)

    Bt2--9 to 15 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium and coarse roots; few faint discontinuous clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 15 percent gravel and 15 percent paragravel; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (6 to 8 inches thick)

    2Cr--15 to 60 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/1) weakly consolidated ash.

COMPETING SERIES:   There are no competing series

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform: concave saddle positions on summits and on backslopes and shoulders of hills
Elevation:  6,200 to 7,700 feet
Slope: 5 to 40 percent
Parent Material: alluvium over weakly consolidated ash, tuffaceous siltstone and tuffaceous sandstone
Climate: long, cool winters; dry, warm summers
Average annual precipitation: 14 to 24 inches
Average annual temperature: 37 to 41 degrees F.
Frost-free season: 50 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brushtop (T), Cadero (T), Hoopgobel (T), and Richollow soils.  Brushtop soils are deep to weakly consolidated material and are on north-facing aspects.  Cadero soils are formed in residuum from weakly consolidated ash and are on north-facing aspects.  Hoopgobel soils are moderately deep to weakly consolidated ash and are on north-facing aspects and have a frigid temperature regime.  Richollow soils have harder bedrock, lack argillic horizon and are on summits.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderately slow permeability

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for wildlife habitat and rangeland.  The dominant native vegetation is mountain big sagebrush, snowberry, serviceberry, buckwheat, Idaho fescue, prairie junegrass, and bluegrass.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Idaho. The series is not extensive. MLRA 43B.
