LAUTZ SERIES

The Lautz series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey lacustrine sediments of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level soils are on a playa floor. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 496 mm, and mean annual temperature is 13 degrees C.

TYPE LOCATION:  Hansford County, Texas; from the intersection of Highway 760 and Highway 207 in Spearman; 9.2 kilometers (5.7 miles) southwest on Highway 207; 6.9 kilometers (4.3 miles) west on Highway 520; 0.6 kilometer (0.4 mile) north on county road; approximately 0.5 kilometer (0.3 mile) east in pasture; Latitude: 36 degrees, 07 minutes, 48.9 seconds N; Longitude: 101 degrees, 19 minutes, 08.2 seconds W; Hansford, Texas USGS quad; NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: An ustic moisture regime bordering on udic. These soils receive runoff from surrounding uplands and the soil moisture control section is moist for longer periods of time than is normal for the climate.  The soil moisture control section is dry and cracks in some or all parts more than 90 but less than 150 cumulative days in normal years.  July through August and November through March are the driest months.  These soils are intermittently moist in September through October and April through June.

Mean annual soil temperature: 13 to 15 degrees C (54 to 59 degrees F).
Depth to secondary calcium carbonate: 100 to 150 cm (40 to 60 inches).
Depth to slickensides: 13 to 30 cm (5 to 15 inches).
Solum thickness: More than 203 cm (80 inches).

Particle-size control section: 45 to 60 percent silicate clay
This is a cyclic soil and undisturbed areas have gilgai microrelief with microhighs 10 to 46 cm (4 to 18 inches) higher than microlows.  Distance between the center of the microhigh and the center of the microlow is about 1.5 to 4.5 meters (5 to 16 feet).  The microhigh makes up about 25 percent, the intermediate, or area between the knoll and depression, about 50 percent, and the microlow about 25 percent.  Cracks open and close each year, except during years with higher than normal rainfall, and remain open for more than 90 and less than 150 cumulative days during normal years.  When dry, 1 to 10 cm wide cracks extend from the surface to a depth of 100 cm or more.  Cracks are more prominent in the microlows.  The range in characteristics represents 50 percent or more of each pedon unless otherwise stated.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the similar Hansford and Knoblaw soils and the Dallam, Darrouzett, Dumas, Gruver, Oslo, Sherm, Sunray, and Texline soils.
Hansford and Knoblaw soils are on similar landscape positions.
Dallam, Darrouzett, Dumas, Gruver, Oslo, Sherm, Sunray, and Texline soils are on higher landscape positions and have an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained and very slow permeability.  Surface runoff is negligible.  These soils are occasionally ponded for brief periods in most years.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly as rangeland with some areas used as cropland.  Many areas are planted to wheat in the fall and utilized for livestock pasture during the winter months, or during dry years, some areas are cultivated to grain sorghum.  Native vegetation varies according to amount of water available.  It includes western wheatgrass, buffalograss, lakeweed, aster, smartweed, and milkweed.  This soil has been correlated to the Playa (R-077AY005TX) ecological site in MLRA-77A.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern High Plains, Northern Part of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and New Mexico (MLRA-77A in LRR H).  The series is of moderate extent.
