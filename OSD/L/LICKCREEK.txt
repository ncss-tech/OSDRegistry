LICKCREEK SERIES

The Lickcreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and the underlying loamy and gravelly outwash. Lickcreek soils are on high flood-plain steps. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 11.1 degrees C (52 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Typic Argiudolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Lickcreek silt loam, on a 0.5 percent slope in a cultivated field at an elevation of 261 meters (855 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 2Bt4--122 to 137 cm (48 to 54 inches); dark brown (10YR 3/3) gravelly sandy clay loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) clay films on faces of peds; 25 percent gravel; neutral; clear wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the 2Bt horizon is 30 to 91 cm (12 to 36 inches).]

 2C--137 to 203 cm (54 to 80 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly sandy loam; massive; very friable; 50 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Hochheim, La Rose, Linkville, Markesan, Plattville, Rotamer, Wea, and Wyanet series. Hochheim, La Rose, Markesan, and Rotamer soils are less than 76 cm (30 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Linkville and Wea soils have less than 7 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section, where the substratum is within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Plattville soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Wyanet soils have carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lickcreek soils are on high flood-plain steps. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The soils formed in alluvium and in the underlying loamy and gravelly outwash in areas of Wisconsinan glaciation. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1092 mm (36 to 43 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 12.2 degrees C (48 to 54 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 180 days. Elevation is 183 to 274 meters (600 to 899 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Eldean, Fox, Gessie, Lash, Ross, and Sloan soils. The well drained Eldean and Fox soils are on higher lying terraces. The well drained Gessie, Lash, and Ross soils are on slightly lower lying flood-plain steps and natural levees. The very poorly drained Sloan soils are in lower lying flood plain channels.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Potential for surface water runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the subsoil and high or very high in the underlying material. Permeability is moderately rapid in the subsoil and rapid in the underlying material.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used to grow corn, soybeans, and small grain, mostly wheat. A few areas are used for hay and pasture. Native vegetation is deciduous forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 111B in east-central Indiana. The series is of small extent.
