LIZA SERIES

The Liza series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess. Liza soils are on mountain slopes and have slopes of 0 to 16 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3.9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Liza silt loam on a mountain slope with 10 percent slope at an elevation of 1982 meters. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 Ap--0 to 23 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam; very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/3) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic; common very fine roots; many very fine irregular and common fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (20 to 30 cm thick)

 AB--23 to 34 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam; dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; few (15 percent) krotovinas; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 15 cm thick)
