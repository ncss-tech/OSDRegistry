LOWLAND SERIES

The Lowland series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium from tuffaceous volcanic rocks or rhyolite.  These soils are on alluvial fans, mountains and hills. Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Vitrandic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lowland ashy loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 12 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) ashy loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate fine and medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 16 inches thick)

    Bw--12 to 20 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) cobbly ashy sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine pores; 20 percent pebbles and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 16 inches thick)

    BC--20 to 38 inches; light gray (10YR 6/1) very cobbly ashy sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; 25 percent pebbles, 15 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary. (13 to 20 inches thick)

    C--38 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/1) very cobbly ashy loamy sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; 20 percent pebbles, 20 percent cobbles, 15 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Lowland soils are mainly used for rangeland, watershed, and as wildlife habitat.  The potential native vegetation is mainly rough fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, Columbia needlegrass, Idaho fescue, and big sagebrush.  Some areas have an overstory of Douglas-fir and lodgepole pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Lowland soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.
