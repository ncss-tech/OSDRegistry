LAWLER SERIES

The Lawler series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of loamy alluvium over sandy and gravelly sediments. Lawler soils are on treads and risers on stream terraces on flood-plain steps and on outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 910 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Lawler loam, on a 1 percent slope, in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

  Bg3--84 to 97 centimeters; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine prominent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) and many medium prominent brown (7.5YR 5/4) masses of oxidized iron; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bg horizon is 20 to 50 centimeters.)

  2C--97 to 200 centimeters; olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) gravelly sand; single grain; loose; about 20 percent mixed rock fragments; neutral.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--50 to 100 centimeters of loamy alluvium over sandy and gravelly sediments

Mean annual air temperature--6 to 12 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation--735 to 1,090 millimeters

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hayfield, Marshan, and Waukee soils.
Hayfield--are on landscape positions similar to those of the Lawler soils and do not have a mollic epipedon
Marshan--are at slightly lower landscape positions and have a frequently saturated zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 0.3 meter during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Waukee--are at slightly higher landscape positions and do not have a frequently saturated zone within a depth of 1.8 meters in years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class--somewhat poorly drained--a frequently saturated zone occurs within depths of 0.3 to 1 meter during April to June in years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation, this saturation is considered apparent
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--1.0 to 10.0 micrometers per second in the loamy alluvium and 100 to 705 micrometers per second in the underlying sandy and gravelly sediments
Flooding--no reasonable possibility of flooding or rarely flooded for brief duration

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are cultivated. The principal crops are corn, soybeans, small grains, and legume hay. The native vegetation is big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, and other grasses of the tall grass prairie.
