LAMONT SERIES

The Lamont series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in eolian deposits.  These soils are on uplands, transverse dunes, and high stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (about 49 degrees F).  Mean annual precipitation is about 810 millimeters (about 32 inches).

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Jefferson County, Iowa, 1957.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 58 to 99 centimeters (23 to 39 inches);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (0 to 59 inches).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 41 centimeters (0 to 16 inches) (Ap and E horizon);
albic horizon--the zone from a depth of 20 to 41 centimeters (8 to 16 inches) (E horizon);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 58 to 99 centimeters (23 to 39 inches) (Bt horizon);
udic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
