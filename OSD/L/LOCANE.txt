LOCANE SERIES

The Locane series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from shale, tuffaceous or siliceous conglomerate and volcanic rock.  The Locane soils are on side slopes and summits of mountains, hills and plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, frigid Lithic Xeric Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Locane very gravelly loam--woodland.  (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is partially covered with about 20 percent stones.

    A--0 to 13 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 10 percent stones and 45 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to 25 cm thick)

    Bt1--13 to 20 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; few faint clay films lining pores; 35 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 13 cm thick)

    Bt2--20 to 48 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; few fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 35 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (8 to 30 cm thick)

    R--48 cm; siliceous conglomerate bedrock with very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) stains at the Bt bedrock interface.

TYPE LOCATION:  Eureka County, Nevada, in the Diamond Valley Area, about 2,700 feet south and 4,500 feet east of the northwest corner of section 5, T. 23 N., R.52 E.; USGS Fraser Creek, NV 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 54 minutes 8 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 7 minutes 55 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.9022222 latitude, -116.131944 longitude.  

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in the winter and spring, aridic bordering on xeric soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.
Depth to bedrock: 25 to 50 cm.
Reaction: Slightly acid or neutral.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  35 to 50 percent.
Rock fragments:  Average 35 to 50 percent.

A horizon
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.

Bt horizons
Hue:  10YR or 7.5YR.
Value:  4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4.
Texture: Gravelly clay loam, very gravelly clay loam, very gravelly clay or cobbly clay.
Structure:  Weak to strong, angular blocky, subangular blocky, granular or is massive.
Thickness:  18 to 38 cm.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Robson series.  Robson soils have argillic horizons containing 50 to 75 percent rock fragments.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Locane soils are on mountain side slopes.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from shale and tuffaceous or siliceous conglomerate and volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 1,710 to 2,440 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool moist winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 350 mm; mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 50 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Labshaft, Hopeka, and Sheege soils.  Labshaft soils lack argillic horizons.  Hopeka and Sheege soils are calcareous throughout and lack argillic horizons.  Hopeka soils, in addition, lack mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Woodland, livestock grazing, wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, Nevada ephedra, Sandberg bluegrass and bluebunch wheatgrass and in woodland areas single leaf pinyon and Utah juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central and northeastern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 25, 24, 27, 28B.
