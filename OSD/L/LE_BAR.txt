LE BAR SERIES

The Le Bar series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in loess and old alluvium.  These soils are on terraces and terrace escarpments and have 0 to 65 percent slopes.  The average annual precipitation is about 100 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Medial, ferrihydritic, mesic Typic Hapludands

TYPICAL PEDON:  Le Bar silt loam - forested.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.  All textures are apparent field textures.)

    Oi--1 to 1/2 inch; litter of needles, twigs, wood, leaves.  (1/2 to 1 inch thick)

    Oe--1/2 inch to 0; partially decomposed remains of needles, twigs, wood, leaves.  (1/2 to 1 inch thick)

    A--0 to 4 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) silt loam, dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) dry; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic and weakly smeary; about 12 percent shot-size concretions; many medium and fine roots; very strongly acid (pH 4.8); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)

    AB--4 to 11 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) silt loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) dry; strong fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic and weakly smeary; about 10 percent shot-size concretions; common medium and fine roots; very strongly acid (pH 4.8); clear smooth boundary.  (7 to 9 inches thick)

    Bw1--11 to 22 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) silt loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; strong fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic and weakly smeary; about 25 percent clay; common medium and fine roots; very strongly acid (pH 4.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 14 inches thick)

    Bw2--22 to 42 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) silt loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) dry; strong fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic and weakly smeary; about 25 percent clay; few fine roots; very strongly acid (pH 4.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (18 to 24 inches thick)

    Bw3--42 to 72 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) silt loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) dry; strong fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic and weakly smeary; about 25 percent clay; few fine roots; very strongly acid (pH 4.6).  (Many feet thick)

TYPE LOCATION:  Mason County, Washington; 7 miles southeast of Matlock on Satsop-Canyon Creek road at Grays Harbor County line; in woods 50 feet east and 50 feet south of parking space east side of road; SW1/4SW1/2 sec. 7, R. 19 N., R. 6 W., W.M.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is more than 40 inches thick, is silt loam with 20 to 27 percent clay and has 0 to 15 percent pebbles.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick.  The upper two-thirds of the control section has less than 4 percent organic carbon in some parts.  The soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.

The A and AB horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR moist and dry, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist.

The B horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR moist, 7.5YR or 10YR dry, and value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bear Prairie, Calawah, Cinebar, Hemcross, Mossyrock, Newaukum, Quillayute, Trouter, and Winema series.  Bear Prairie soils have a solum with 10YR hue and an umbric epipedon 20 to 30 inches thick.  Calawah soils have 4 to 7 percent organic carbon in the upper two-thirds of the control section. Cinebar soils have a xeric moisture regime.  Hemcross soils have 5 to 30 percent rock fragments in the Bw horizon and have more than 4 percent organic carbon throughout the upper two-thirds of the particle-size control section. Mossyrock soils have a xeric moisture regime, an umbric epipedon 24 to 34 inches thick and are slightly acid or neutral in the control section.  Newaukum soils have a xeric moisture regime and 15 to 30 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Quillayute soils have an umbric epipedon more than 20 inches thick.  Trouter soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact. Winema soils have a solum with 10YR hue, an umbric epipedon 20 to 30 inches thick, and silty clay B2 horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are at elevations of 100 to 800 feet on terraces and terrace escarpments.  They formed in loess and old alluvium derived mostly from sandstone.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is 80 to 120 inches with most of the moisture as rainfall in the autumn-winter-spring season.  The mean January temperature is about 38 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 62 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 120 to 160 days. Growing season (28 degrees F) is 200 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Hoquiam, Lystair, and Nordby soils.  Hoquiam soils have an ochric epipedon.  Lystair soils are very gravelly throughout.  Nordby soils are loamy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for growing timber.  Native cover is mainly Douglas-fir, western hemlock, western redcedar, red alder, and bigleaf maple with an understory of salal, western brackenfern, Oregon-grape, western swordfern, red huckleberry, salmonberry, red elderberry, deer fern and vine maple.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Washington.  The series is of moderate extent.
