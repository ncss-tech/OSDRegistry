Grundelein and Lafayette soils contain more than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Hacreek, Keller, and Raub soils have less than 50 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section.  Loran soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lawndale soils are on nearly level upland flats. They formed in 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches) of loess and the underlying eolian sandy deposits. The source of the sandy material was nearby stream valleys or outwash plains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.6 to 11.7 degrees C (51 to 53 degrees F), annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1016 millimeters (36 to 40 inches), frost free days range from 175 to 185, and elevation ranges from 155.5 to 289.6 meters (510 to 950 feet) above mean sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Broadwell, Drummer, Edgington, Ipava, Sable and Thorp soils. The well drained Broadwell soils are in the drainage sequence with Lawndale soils and are on higher parts of the landscape nearby. The poorly drained Drummer, Edgington, Sable and Thorp soils occur in lower areas and have gray colors throughout. Ipava soils are on similar landscapes nearby where the loess is greater than 80 inches thick. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Lawndale soils are somewhat poorly drained. Potential for surface runoff is low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the loess and high to very high ( 14.11 to 141. 14 micrometers per second) in the sandy deposits. These soils have moderate permeability in the loess, and moderately rapid or rapid permeability in the sandy deposits. The depth to the top of an apparent high water ranges from 30 to 61 centimeters (1 to 2 feet) in the spring in normal years. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. Corn, soybeans, and small grain, are the major crops. Native vegetation is prairie grasses. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Illinois.  Extent is moderate in MLRA 108B.
