LOLALITA SERIES

The Lolalita series consists of very deep, well drained soils on terraces.  They formed in old sediments mainly from acid igneous sources.  Slopes are 0 to 75 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, nonacid, mesic Xeric Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lolalita coarse sandy loam, range. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

A--0 to 3 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) coarse sandy loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak medium platy structure in upper half inch and weak very fine granular structure below; soft, very friable, slightly sticky; many fine roots; many very fine pores; neutral (pH 6.9); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 5 inches thick)

C--3 to 36 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) coarse sandy loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky; common fine roots; many very fine pores; neutral (pH 7.0); wavy boundary. (22 to 50 inches thick)

2Ck--36 to 60 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 7/3) loamy coarse sand, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable; few fine roots; few faint carbonate veins; slightly effervescent, mildly alkaline (pH 7.8); (6 to 30 inches thick)

TYPE LOCATION:  Gem County, Idaho; about 6 miles south of Emmett; 650 feet west and 500 feet south of the center of the SE1/4 sec. 25, T.6N., R.2W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Average annual soil temperature - 47 to 54 degrees F.

Average Summer temperature - 64 to 71 degrees F.

Strongly contrasting textures - depths below 40 inches

A horizon

C horizons

Texture - COSL, SL

Control section 10 to 40 inches - less 18 percent clay and less 35 percent coarse fragments
Reaction - slightly acid to mildly alkaline
A weak carbonate horizon is common below 2 to 3 feet depth.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Jenness and Luckyrich series. Jenness soils are dominantly loam or silt loam in the upper part of the 10 to 40 inch control sections.  Luckyrich soils have a 54 to 59 degrees soil temperature and are dry for 130 days, June through October.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Lolalita soils are on level to very steep uplands and terraces at elevations of 2,000 to 4,500 feet. Many areas have south facing slopes. Slopes range from 0 to 75 percent. The soil formed chiefly in unconsolidated sediments from intrusive acid igneous rocks.  The climate is semiarid and summers are dry. The average freeze-free period is 110 to 170 days, and the average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches, including 1 to 2.5 feet of snow.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Jenness soils and the Chilcott, Lanktree, and Payette soils. Chilcott and Lanktree soils have clayey argillic horizons. Payette soils have mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well and somewhat excessively drained; slow to rapid runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mostly range, but some areas on gentler slopes are used for irrigated cropland. The natural vegetation is chiefly big sagebrush, Sandberg bluegrass, Indian ricegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, cheatgrass, three-awn grass, and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Idaho and possibly southeastern Oregon. The series is of moderate extent.
