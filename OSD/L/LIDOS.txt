LIDOS SERIES

The Lidos series consists of very deep, well drained soils with slow permeability that formed in colluvium from basalt mixed with volcanic ash in the upper part over alluvium from fine pyroclastic materials and basalt. Slopes range from 4 to 65 percent in mountains and foothills. The average annual precipitation is about 29 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, isotic, frigid Vitrandic Argixerolls

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bly, Hess, Melhorn, Raycreek (T), Salcreek (T) and Vangoe (T) series. All these soils lack buried genetic horizons. Bly soils have mollic epipedons 20 to 30 inches thick and durinodes in the lower argillic horizon. Hess soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock. Melhorn soils do not have coarse loamy buried E horizons or clayey buried Bt horizons. Raycreek soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock. Salcreek soils have greater than 50 percent sand in the particle-size control section and rock fragments are dominantly of glacial till origin. Vangoe soils have mollic epipedons 20 to 33 inches thick and are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock.
Runyon (T) soils have a similar classification with mixed mineralogy and is 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact (vesicular basalt). 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lidos soils are on mountains slopes and hill backslopes and footslopes at elevations of 3,850 to 5,900 feet. These soils formed in colluvium from basalt mixed with volcanic ash in the upper part over alluvium from fine pyroclastic materials and basalt. Slopes range from 4 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is 26 to 32 inches. The average annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 60 to 90 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Hess and the Cleymor and Klicker series. Cleymor and Hess soils are on concave positions and are clayey. Klicker soils are on convex positions and are moderately deep and loamy-skeletal. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to very rapid runoff; slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Lidos soils are used mainly for timber production and woodland grazing. Native vegetation is Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine and mallow ninebark. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West-central Idaho. MLRA 43b. Lidos soils are not extensive.
