LYALL SERIES

The Lyall series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in minor amounts of volcanic ash mixed with alluvium and reworked glacial drift on terraces, alluvial fans, valley walls, and debris cones.  Slopes are 0 to 15 on terraces and alluvial fans and 15 to 65 percent on valley walls and debris cones.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1,650 millimeters.  The mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Vitrandic Dystroxerepts

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Pajo and Tripod series.  The Pajo soils have a paralithic contact with weathered bedrock at a depth of 50 to 100 cm.  Tripod soils have an umbric epipedon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Lyall soils are on valley walls, terraces, alluvial fans, and debris cones at elevations of 300 to 800 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium and reworked glacial drift with minor amounts of volcanic ash.  The climate consists of cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 600 to 1700 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 5 to 10 degrees C. Frost free season is 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Mesahchie (T), Goode (T), and Busterbrown (T) soils.  Mesahchie soils have an umbric epipedon and a volcanic ash mantel, and form in areas of more herbaceous vegetation on valley walls and alluvial fans.  Goode soils have a volcanic ash mantle and form on more stable portions of terraces, alluvial fans and valley walls. Busterbrown soils lack ash and form on wetter, more active portions of terraces, debris cones and alluvial fans. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for watershed, recreation, woodland, and wildlife habitat.  Potential natural vegetation consists primarily of Douglas-fir with an understory of clasping twistedstalk, trailing blackberry, tall Oregon-grape, bracken fern, and snowberry.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western slopes of the North Cascade Mountains, Washington.  MLRA 3.  Series is of moderate extent.
