LAVODNAS SERIES

The Lavodnas series consists of shallow, well drained slowly permeable soils that formed in local alluvium and slope alluvium derived from gypsiferous shale on hills and ridges. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Leptic Haplogypsids

TYPICAL PEDON: Lavodnas loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few fine and common very fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 4 inches thick)

    By1--3 to 9 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 7/4) clay loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few medium and common fine and very fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 2 percent pebbles; many medium clusters of gypsum crystals; strongly effervescent; calcium carbonate is disseminated; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (5 to 15 inches thick)

    By2--9 to 13 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) clay, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; massive; hard, friable sticky and plastic; few fine and common very fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 5 percent pebbles; common large clusters of gypsum crystals; slightly effervescent; calcium carbonate is disseminated; neutral; gradual smooth boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick)

    Cr--13 to 28 inches; gypsiferous shale and weathered sandstone.

    2R--28 inches; sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION: McKinley County, New Mexico; Tinian Quadrangle; about 1 mile south of Tinian; 107 degrees 19 minutes 55 seconds west longitude and 35 degrees 49 minutes 19 seconds north latitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

The SMCS is usually dry, in all parts, 105 to 160 cumulative days from April through October. It is usually moist, in some part, 50 to 105 cumulative days during the same period. It is intermittently moist in some part November through April. The period of maximum precipitation is July through October. The soil is driest during May and June. Ustic aridic moisture regime.

Soil Temperature: 51 to 56 degrees F.

Depth to paralithic contact - 10 to 20 inches.

Percent clay in the particle-size control section - 18 to 35 percent.

A Horizon
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 4 or 6
Rock Fragments: 0 to 5 percent pebbles

By Horizon
Value: 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 2 or 4
Texture: clay loam or clay
Percent Gypsum: 10 to 35 percent
Rock Fragments: 0 to 5 percent pebbles

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Toadlena series. Toadlena soils do not have a lithic contact and are drier.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Lavodnas soils formed in local alluvium and slope alluvium derived from shale and are on hills and ridges. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 6,600 to 7,200 feet. The mean annual temperature is 49 to 54 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches. The frost free period is 120 to 140.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bond, Hagerman soils on mesas and cuestas, the Palma, Penistaja and Querencia soils on terraces, valleys and toeslopes, and the Sparank and San Mateo soils on floodplains and alluvial fans. Palma, Penistaja, Querencia, Sparank and San Mateo soils are deep. Hagerman and Bond soils have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; rapid runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for livestock grazing. Present vegetation is alkali sacaton, galleta, winter fat, pale wolfberry and scattered oneseed juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West central New Mexico; MLRA 35, LRR-D. This series is of small extent.
