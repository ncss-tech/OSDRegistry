LEGATE SERIES

The Legate series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from limestone.  Legate soils are on backslopes and shoulders of hills.  Slopes are 15 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, mesic Lithic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Legate extremely gravelly sandy loam--on a backslope of a hill sloping 32 percent to the south-southeast (165 degrees) at 7,510 feet elevation-pinyon-juniper forestland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described, the soil was dry throughout.)

(0 to 6 inches thick)

    2R--18 inches; indurated limestone bedrock

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture - The soil moisture control section is moist in all parts during the 60 days following the winter solstice. It is moist in some part less than 40 percent and moist in all parts less than 25 percent of the time when the soil temperature at 20 inches is above 41 degrees F. The soils are driest in May and June. The soil moisture regime is ustic bordering on aridic.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Deama series. Deama soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Legate soils are on backslopes of hills. They formed in colluvium derived from limestone. Slopes are 15 to 45 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,200 to 8,500 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F. The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Yohalem and Zarmand soils. Yohalem soils are clayey, have a paralithic contact within 20 inches, and occur on backslopes of shale hills. Zarmand soils are coarse-loamy, have a lithic contact between 20 and 40 inches, and occur on beveled summits of hills.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; very high surface runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Legate soils are used for urban development, cord wood products, livestock grazing, and recreation. The historic climax vegetation is blue grama, eriogonum, Bigelow's rubber rabbitbrush, oneseed juniper, twoneedle pinyon.  The ecological site is Pinus edulis-Juniperus monosperma/Cercocarpus montanus-Chrysothamnus nauseosus/Bouteloua gracilis (F036XB135NM).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Legate soils are of small extent on the southwestern Sangre de Cristo part of the Southern Rocky Mountains province in northcentral New Mexico. The MLRA is 49.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Santa Fe County, New Mexico; Santa Fe Area Soil Survey Update; 2008. The name is coined. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of 9 inches. (Ak and Bk1 horizons)
Calcic horizon - The zone from 9 to 18 inches. The calcic was judged to begin at 9 inches because of the very large increase in carbonate content at that depth. (Bk2 and Bk3 horizons)
Lithic contact - indurated limestone bedrock at 18 inches. (2R layer)
Particle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 18 inches (Bk2and Bk3 horizons)
Series control section - The zone from 0 to 18 inches.

Taxonomic version: Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Calcium carbonate equivalence was determined using a calcimeter.
