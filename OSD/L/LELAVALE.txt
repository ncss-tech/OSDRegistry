LELAVALE SERIES

The Lelavale series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits of Pleistocene age.  These are depressional soils on nearly level coastal plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent slope but mainly less than 0.5 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1350 mm (53 in).

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Lelavale soils are very poorly drained.  Runoff is negligible.  Permeability is slow.  These soils remain ponded from October to June in most years.  

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used primarily for wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation includes black gum, water oak, red maple and sweetbay.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The Western Gulf Coast Flatwoods (MLRA 152B) of southeast Texas and possibly Louisiana.  The series is of minor extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Temple, Texas.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Hardin County, Texas; 1998.

REMARKS:  These soils were formerly included with the Waller series, mainly in the depressional unit.  The series was revised during the recorrelation of MLRA 152B

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon- 0 to 10 cm (0 to 4 in) (A horizon)

Glossic horizon- 31 to 104 cm (12 to 41 in) (Btg/E horizons)

Argillic horizon- 10 to 203 cm (4 to 80 in) (Bt/E, and Btg/E horizons)

Aquic feature- These soils have aquic conditions for some time from October to June in normal years.
