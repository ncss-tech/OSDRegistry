LOVLINE SERIES

The Lovline series consists of moderately deep, well drained
soils on hills.  They formed in colluvium weathered from
Burnt River schist and shale with an influence of loess and
volcanic ash.  Lovline soils are on slopes of 2 to 70
percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches,
and the average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lovline channery loam, range.  (Colors are
for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

A--0 to 9 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2)
channery loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak fine platy structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic;
common roots; many very fine tubular pores; 20 percent shale channers; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 10
inches thick)

Bw1--9 to 20 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) channery
loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak medium subangular
blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky,
slightly plastic; common roots; many very fine tubular
pores; 20 percent shale channers; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual
wavy boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)

Bw2--20 to 38 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4)
channery loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; weak fine subangular
blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly
plastic; few roots; many very fine and fine pores; 20
percent shale channers; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt wavy
boundary.  (10 to 24 inches thick)

R--38 inches; Burnt River schist bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Baker County, Oregon; by the Snake River,
between Fox and Hibbard Creek; NE1/4SW1/4 sec. 22, T. 12 S.,
R. 45 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20
to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.
The amount of shale channers up to 3 inches in size is 0 to
25 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51
degrees F.  The soil temperature is above 41 degrees F from
April to November and above 47 degrees F from May to
October.  The soil is dry throughout from mid-June to
October and is moist in some part during May to mid-June and mid-October to November.  The soils are moist for 45 to 60 consecutive days when the soil temperature is above 47
degrees F.

The A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and
chroma of 2 moist and dry in the A, and 2 or 3 in the AB
horizon.

The Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and
chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is loam, channery loam,
or channery clay loam with 15 percent or more fine sand or
coarser.  The clay content is 18 to 35 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Capona and Sutro series.
Capona soils have coarse fragments which are subangular in
shape and the soils are moist for 60 to 90 consecutive days
when the soil temperature is above 47 degrees F.  Sutro
soils are 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lovline soils are on hills at
elevations of 2,000 to 3,600 feet.  Slope is 2 to 70
percent.  The soils formed in colluvium weathered from Burnt
River schist and shale with and influence of loess and
volcanic ash.  The climate is semiarid with a mean annual precipitation of 9 to 12 inches.  The mean annual
temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F.  The mean
January temperature is about 27 degrees F, and the mean July temperature is about 69 degrees F.  The frost-free period is
100 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Lookout and
Ruckles series.  Lookout soils have a clayey argillic
horizon and a duripan.  Ruckles soils are less than 20
inches to bedrock and have a clayey-skeletal argillic
horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Rapid runoff.
Moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Range, wildlife and water supply.  The
native vegetation includes bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho
fescue, Sandberg bluegrass, rabbitbrush and sage.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Baker County and
northern Malheur County, Oregon.  The series is of limited
extent.
