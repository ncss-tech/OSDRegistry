LADO SERIES

The Lado series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in a thick mantle of volcanic ash over colluvium derived from granite or gneiss. They are on mountain slopes, hills, benches, ridges and summits. Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 1,025 mm, and the average annual temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Medial over loamy, amorphic over mixed, active, frigid Alfic Udivitrands

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brequito, Brodeer and Mushel series. Brequito soils occur on mountain slopes and ridge summits and have a thin mantle of volcanic ash. Brodeer soils occur on mountain slopes and hills and do not have a discreet loess layer in the profile.  Mushel soils occur on mountain slopes and hills. They do not have a discreet loess layer and have a thin mantle of volcanic ash.  

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained, moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, watershed, and recreation. Potential natural vegetation is western red cedar, grand fir, western larch, western white pine, and Douglas-fir, with an understory of wild ginger, queencup beadlily, coolwort foamflower, pioneer violet, princes pine, and fools huckleberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North Central Idaho. Lado soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 43A.
