LEROMAN SERIES

The Leroman series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from tuff, tuff-breccia, and andesite.  Leroman soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually moist in the moisture control section during late fall, winter, and spring; dry from July through early October for 75 to 90 consecutive days in the four months following the summer solstice; xeric moisture regime that borders on aridic.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bullump, Bullvaro, Burchflat, Camelback, Chrisflat, Dogbed, Dooh, Erig, Krenka, Lockgate, Murain, Nutval, Snyderville, Softback, Softscrabble, Staberg, Vetagrande, and Vipont series.

Bullump and Camelback soils have lithic contacts between 100 and 200 cm from the soil surface.  Bullvaro, Dooh, Nutval, and Vetagrande soils have an aridic moisture regime.  Burchflat and Vipont soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Chrisflat, Dogbed, Krenka, Murain, Snyderville, Softback, and Softscrabble soils are very deep.  Erig soils are deep to lithic contacts.  Lockgate soils are deep to paralithic contacts.  Staberg soils have argillic horizons that are 15 to 30 cm thick, have the upper boundary of the argillic horizon at depths of 36 to 64 cm from the soil surface, and have C horizons overlying the paralithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Leroman soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on footslope and backslope positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuff, tuff-breccia, and andesite.  Slopes are 8 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,985 to 2,750 meters.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 410 to 610 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chenhigh, Celeridge, and Heenlake soils.  Chenhigh and Celeridge soils are shallow to lithic contacts.  Heenlake soils have mollic epipedons that are less than 50 cm thick.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high surface runoff; moderately slow permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Leroman soils are used for livestock grazing, recreation, watershed, and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, snowberry, mountain brome, and western needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern California, on the east side of the Sierra Nevada Range.  These soils are not extensive. MLRAs 22A and 26.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 58 cm (A, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons).
Argillic horizon - The zone from 13 to 86 cm (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).
Paralithic contact - The boundary at 86 cm to underlying soft bedrock (Cr layer).
Lithic contact - The boundary at 109 cm (R horizon).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 13 to 63 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons and part of the Bt3 horizon).

The revision of October 2003 updated the taxonomic class from Loamy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Pachic Argixerolls.  The isotic mineralogy class was based solely on the field determined values for sodium fluoride pH.  Laboratory data on 15 bar water to clay ratio does not exist to verify the isotic mineralogy class.
