TYPICAL PEDON:  Levy silty clay loam - fresh water marsh.  (Colors are for wet soil.)

A--0 to 8 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) silty clay loam; massive; very sticky; soil flows easily between fingers when squeezed leaving a residue of live roots and fibric organic materials; about 20 percent by volume live roots; about 20 percent by volume organic matter of dominantly fibric material; extremely acid; gradual wavy boundary.

Cg1--8 to 44 inches; dark greenish gray (5GY 4/1) silty clay; few fine distinct pale brown (10YR 6/3) depletions; massive; very sticky; soil flows easily between fingers when squeezed leaving a residue of live roots and fibric organic materials; about 5 percent by volume live roots; about 15 percent by volume organic matter of dominantly fibric material; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

Cg2--44 to 60 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) silty clay; massive; sticky; soil flows with difficulty between fingers when squeezed leaving a residue with about 10 percent by volume of organic matter of dominantly fibric material; moderately acid.  (Combined thickness of the C horizon is 24 to more than 60 inches.)

TYPE LOCATION:  Georgetown County, South Carolina; one mile east of intersection of U. S. Highway 701 and North Street in city of Georgetown, in the flood plains of the Pee Dee River.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth to Bedrock: Greater than 60 inches
Depth to Seasonal High Water Table: +24 to 0 inches, January to December
Soil Reaction: extremely acid to strongly acid in water between the surface and a depth of about 40 inches.  Below a depth of about 40 inches, the soil is very strongly acid to mildly alkaline 
n value: greater than 0.7 in all mineral layers between the surface and a depth of 40 inches
COLE: more than 0.06 in all mineral layers to a depth of 40 inches but because the soil is continuously saturated, it does not crack 

  This soil has an n value greater than 0.7 in all mineral layers between the surface and a depth of 40 inches.  The soil is extremely acid to strongly acid in water between the surface and a depth of about 40 inches.  Below a depth of about 40 inches, the soil is very strongly acid to mildly alkaline.  The COLE of the mineral layers to a depth of 40 inches is estimated to be more than 0.06, but because the soil is continuously saturated, it does not crack.  In pedons with mottling, at some depth within 20 inches of the mineral surface the dominant colors in the matrix have chroma of 2 or less.  At some depth within 20 inches of the mineral surface, in pedons with no redox features, if the value is less than 4, the chroma is less than 1; if the value is 4 or more, the chroma is 1 or less.

RANGE OF INDIVIDUAL HORIZONS:

O horizon (if it occurs):
Color--hue of 7.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3
Texture (fine-earth fraction)-mineral fraction, from 2 to 20 percent by volume, is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam, or mucky loam 
Other features-- leaves, grasses, twigs, and roots 1 to 15 inches thick

A horizon:
Color--hue of 10YR to 5Y, or it is neutral, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 3
Texture (fine-earth fraction)-- silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, clay, or mucky analogs 
Redoximorphic features (if they occur)--iron masses in shade of red, yellow, or brown and iron depletions in shades of brown, yellow, olive, or gray

Cg horizon (to depth of 40 inches, or more):
Color--hue of 10YR, to 5Y, 5GY, 5G, or neutral; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 0 to 2
Texture (fine-earth fraction)-- clay or silty clay with thin strata of clay loam in some pedons
Redoximorphic features (if they occur)--iron masses in shade of red, yellow, or brown and iron depletions in shades of brown, yellow, olive, or gray

Cg horizon (below 40 inches, in some pedons):
Color--hue of 10YR, to 5Y, 5GY, 5G, or neutral; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 0 to 2
Texture (fine-earth fraction)-- organic layers, sandy layers, loamy layers, or clayey layers 
Redoximorphic features (if they occur)--iron masses in shade of red, yellow, or brown and iron depletions in shades of brown, yellow, olive, or gray
Other features-- Some of these layers have n values of less than 0.7.  Fragments of wood, logs, and buried stumps are in many pedons.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Jasper County, South Carolina, 1975.

REMARKS:  The Levy series was formerly mapped either swamp or fresh water marsh.  If drained, the classification of these soils changes.  The classification is based on data from 5 pedons.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Aquic conditions: permanently saturated and reduced matrix below 10 inches
n-value: greater than 0.7 in all horizons between 8 and 20 inches
% clay: greater than or equal to 8 percent in all horizons between 8 and 20 inches
