LUMPGULCH SERIES 

The Lumpgulch series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from granitic bedrock. These soils are on bedrock-floored plains, hillslopes, mountains and escarpments. Slopes are 4 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4.5 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Lumpgulch gravelly sandy clay loam, bouldery, in forest (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 2 cm; partially decomposed needles, twigs and leaves. 

    A--2 to 7 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly sandy clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine and medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine, and few medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine, and few medium pores; 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 14 cm thick) 

    E--7 to 18 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine, and few medium and coarse roots; many very fine and few fine tubular and interstitial pores; 25 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 25 cm thick) 

    Bt--18 to 56 cm; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) gravelly sandy clay loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; moderate medium and coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium and coarse roots; many very fine and few fine tubular and interstitial pores; many faint clay films bridging sand grains and on faces of peds; 30 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (36 to 64 cm thick) 

    Cr--56 to 69 cm; light olive gray decomposed granite bedrock (grus) that crushes to very gravelly loamy coarse sand; neutral (pH 6.7). (3 to 12 cm thick) 

    R--69 inches; hard granite bedrock.
