Range of Individual Horizons:
A horizon:
Color--hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5, chroma of 1 or 2

Ap horizon (if it occurs):
Color--hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 1 or 2
Texture (fine-earth fraction)--sand or fine sand

E horizon:
Color--hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, chroma of 1 or 2
Texture (fine-earth fraction)--sand or fine sand

Bh horizon:
Color--hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, chroma of 2 to 6. The redder hue and lower value and chroma are restricted to discontinuous thin subhorizons in the uppermost part of the Bh horizon.
Texture--sand, loamy sand, fine sand

Redoximorphic Features--iron depletions in shades of olive or gray and iron accumulations in shades of red, brown, yellow, or olive

C horizon:
Color--hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6
Texture (fine-earth fraction)--sand above 40 inches, and sand to clay below 40 inches
Redoximorphic Features--iron depletions in shades of olive or gray and iron accumulations in shades of red, brown, yellow, or olive

Cg horizon (if it occurs):
Color--hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2
Texture (fine-earth fraction)--sand above 40 inches, and sand to clay below 40 inches
Redoximorphic Features--iron depletions in shades of olive or gray and iron accumulations in shades of red, brown, yellow, or olive

COMPETING SERIES: None

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: Coastal plain
Landform: Broad flats bordering streams and depressions
Elevation: 2 to 20 feet
Parent Material: Sandy coastal plain sediments
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 50 to 56 degrees F.
Mean Annual Precipitation: 40 to 48 inches
Frost Free Period: 180 to 210 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Lakewood soils--excessively drained with a seasonal high water table below 60 inches, on slightly higher landforms
Atsion soils--poorly drained with a seasonal high water table above 12 inches, on slightly lower-lying positions
Berryland soils--very poorly drained with a seasonal high water table above 6 inches, on lower-lying positions
Woodmansie soils--well drained and have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section, on slightly higher lying landforms 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage Class (Agricultural): Moderately well drained

USE AND VEGETATION: Mostly woodland.  Acres once farmed have now been abandoned.  Wooded areas are dominantly pitch pine, shortleaf pine, black, and white oak, with an understory of lowbush blueberries and scrub oak.  Where wildfires have been severe, pitch pine and black jack oak are dominant.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Coastal Plain of New Jersey and Virginia
Extent: Large

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Camburton SCS Project, in portions of Burlington and Camden Counties, New Jersey, 1945

REMARKS: The Lakehurst series was previously classified as Entic Haplorthods. These soils typically have a Bh horizon less than 4 inches thick or if the horizon is more than 4 inches, it fails either the physical or chemical properties defined for spodic materials.

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 3 inches (A horizon)
Albic horizon--the zone from 3 to 15 inches (E horizon)
Spodic horizon--the zone from 15 to 18 inches (Bh horizon)
Aquic conditions--the zone from 18 inches to a depth of 80 inches is periodically saturated (endosaturation)
