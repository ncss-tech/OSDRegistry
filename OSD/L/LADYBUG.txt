LADYBUG SERIES

The Ladybug series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from metasedimentary rock. The Ladybug soils are on mountain slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 895 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil temperature: The mean annual soil temperature at 50 cm is 11 to 15 degrees C and the difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is greater than 6 degrees C. The soils have a mesic temperature regime.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Ladybug soils are on convex shoulders and backslopes of mountain slopes. Slopes range from 30 to 75 percent. These soils formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from metasedimentary rock. Elevation is 755 to 1930 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 730 to 1030 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 10 to 15 degrees C. The frost free season is 160 to 245 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Colonymill, Kaweah, and Whiskeylog soils. The Colonymill soils are on broadly convex backslopes of mountain slopes and do not have a lithic contact within 150 cm. The Kaweah soils are on concave to linear backslopes or drainages on mountain slopes and have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section. The Whiskeylog soils are on convex to linear backslopes of mountain slopes and lack a mollic epipedon (dark surface).

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Vegetation is canyon live oak, black oak, alderleaf mountain mahogany, California buckeye, and poison oak.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. These soils are of limited extent.
