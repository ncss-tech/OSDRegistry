LETRADO SERIES

The Letrado series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from rhyolitic tuff.  Letrado soils are on toeslopes and footslopes of interfluves on undulating plateaus. Slopes are 5 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Paleustalfs

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. A similar soil in another family is the Predawn series. Predawn soils are in an aridic ustic moisture regime and have a strong calcic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Letrado soils are on toeslopes and footslopes of ?? on undulating plateaus. They formed in slope alluvium derived from rhyolitic tuff of the Quaternary age Bandelier Tuff formation. Slopes are 5 to 15 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,900 to 7,600 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F. The frost-free period is 120 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Adornado, Rotado, Tocal, and Urioste soils. Adornado soils are ashy-pumiceous, have mollic epipedons, and occur on backslopes and footslopes of undulating plateaus. Rotado soils are fine, moderately deep, and occur on summits of undulating plateaus. Tocal soils are clayey, shallow, and occur on shoulders of undulating plateaus. Urioste soils are ashy, very shallow, and occur on backslopes of undulating plateaus.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; very high surface runoff; permeability is slow. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Letrado soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat. Present vegetation is ponderosa pine, Gambel oak and mountain muhly.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Letrado soils are of small extent on the southwestern Jemez Volcanic Field part of the Southern Rocky Mountain province in northcentral New Mexico. The MLRA is 48A.
