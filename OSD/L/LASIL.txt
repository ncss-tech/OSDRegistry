LASIL SERIES

The Lasil series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Lasil soils are on low lake terraces and lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lasil soils are on smooth to channeled low lake terraces and lake plains.  They formed in calcareous lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sedimentary and igneous rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  Elevations range from 4,200 to 4,500 feet.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is 65 to 75 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 190 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Decker, Saltair, and Jordan soils.  Decker soils lack natric horizons and have control sections that have more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  Saltair soils have salic horizons and lack natric horizons.  Jordan soils have salic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; medium surface runoff; slow permeability (moderately low or moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity).  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 2.5 and 4.0 feet (moderately deep or deep free water occurrence classes) between April and September.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  Drained phases occur in areas reclaimed for cropland.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Lasil soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat, except for small areas that are reclaimed and used for irrigated cropland.  The native vegetation is black greasewood, pickleweed, inland saltgrass, and rubber rabbitbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Utah.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 28A.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Phoenix, Arizona.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Albic horizon - The zone from the soil surface to 9 inches (E and EB horizons).

Natric horizon - The zone from 9 to 19 inches (Btkn1 and Btkn2 horizons).

Calcic horizon - The zone from 9 to 29 inches (Btkn1, Btkn2, and Bk horizons).

Endosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 30 and 50 inches at certain times during normal years (parts of the C horizons).

Particle-size control section - The zone from 9 to 19 inches (Btkn1 and Btkn2 horizons).


The revision of April 2005 updated the taxonomic class from Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Natrustalfs based on the assumed moisture regime being xeric instead of ustic.

The Lasil series is currently mapped in three soil survey areas in Utah.  There are some phases which have the average depth to the seasonal high saturation within 30 inches of the soil surface.  Such phases should classify in the subgroup of Aquic Natrixeralfs.  Future study is needed to determine whether a new series concept should be developed for these wetter phases of Lasil or whether they should be correlated to the Arave series.

The superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has partial characterization data by the Soils Laboratory from Utah State University (USU) Logan, UT and is published on pages 122-123, Table 7 of the Soil Survey of Salt Lake Area, Utah.  The pH values in the typical pedon are from saturated paste.
