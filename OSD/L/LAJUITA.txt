LAJUITA SERIES

The Lajuita series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium over residuum derived from sandstone and shale.  Lajuita soils are on hillslopes and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 3 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 457 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lajuita cobbly sandy loam, on a south facing, convex, 8 percent slope in ponderosa pine woodland at an elevation of 2,134 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on August 10, 1999 the soil was moist from 0 to 38 cm.

    Oi--0 to 3 cm; slightly decomposed pine needles.

    A--3 to 8 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) cobbly sandy loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; 15 percent cobble, 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 10 cm thick)

    Bt--8 to 28 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, and slightly plastic; common fine, medium, and coarse roots; common very fine tubular pores, common distinct clay films on ped faces; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.  (15 to 28 cm thick)

    Cr--28 to 38 cm; partially weathered sandstone; few coarse roots in fractures; clear smooth boundary.   (3 to 18 cm thick) 

    R--38 cm; hard sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION:  Rio Arriba County, New Mexico; about 8 kilometers west of Dulce; located about 732 meters east and 305 meters south of the northwest corner of sec. 15, T. 13 N., R. 2 W.; Wirt Canyon USGS quad; Lat. 36 degrees, 55 minutes, 57 seconds, N. and Long. 107 degrees, 05 minutes, 03 seconds W., NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - hillslopes, mountain slopes
Elevation - 2,070 to 2,685 meters
Slopes - 3 to 35 percent
Parent material - slope alluvium and/or colluvium over residuum derived from sandstone and shale
Precipitation pattern - precipitation falls mostly during the months of November through March and July through October.  June is the driest month.  Total snowfall averages about 1.2 to 1.5 meters with snowmelt lasting into April.
Mean annual temperature - 5.5 to 7.2 degrees C.
Mean annual precipitation - 400 to 510 mm

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to very rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major uses are livestock grazing, commercial woodland, and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is ponderosa pine with an understory of Arizona fescue, mountain muhly, pine dropseed, and bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern New Mexico and southern Colorado; LRR D, E; MLRA 36, 48A; moderate extent.
