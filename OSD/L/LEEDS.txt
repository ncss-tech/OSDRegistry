LEEDS SERIES

The Leeds series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from sandstone, limestone and shale.  The Leeds soils are on alluvial valleys and fans.  Slope ranges from 0 to 10.  The mean annual air temperature is about 61 F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, thermic Typic Torrifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Leeds silty clay loam - cultivated (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap--0 to 8 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) silty clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure that parts to moderate medium granular structure; hard, firm, sticky, slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium roots; common fine and very fine interstitial pores; strongly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick)

    A--8 to 15 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) silty clay loam; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky, plastic; common fine and very fine roots; few fine and common very fine interstitial pores; strongly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 12 inches thick)

    C1--15 to 23 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) sandy loam, dark red (2.5YR 3/6) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots; few fine and very fine interstitial pores; strongly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 20 inches thick)

    C2--23 to 60 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) silt loam; dark red (2.5YR 3/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; strongly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8).

TYPE LOCATION: Washington County, Utah; 2 1/2 miles south of Washington; 800 feet north and 1,250 feet west of the southeast corner of sec. 34, T.42 S., R.l5 W; St. George Quadrangle; lat. 37 degrees 5 minutes 2 seconds N. and long. 113 degrees 31 minutes 37 seconds W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Intermittently moist in the soil moisture control section during July-August and December-January.  Driest during May and June.  Typic aridic soil moisture regime.

Mean annual soil temperature: 59 to 67 F.

Mean summer soil temperature: 77 to 82 F.

Effervescence: slightly to strongly

Texture PSCS: commonly stratified but averages silt loam or loam

Clay content PSCS: 18 to 27 percent
A horizon
Hue: 7.5YR or 5YR
Value: 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 6 moist
Chroma: 2 through 4
Texture: loam or silty clay loam. The silty clay loam results from the application of irrigation water that is high in silt content. The silted material ranges from 4 to 19 inches thick, but most commonly is 8 to 14 inches thick

C horizon
Hue: 5YR or 2.5YR
Value: 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist
Chroma: 4 through 6
Texture: sandy loam, silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam, and in some pedons is stratified with very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam
Rock fragments: Some pedons contain 5 to 20 percent gravel

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Lerdo and Rosamond series.  These soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Leeds soils are on alluvial valleys and fans at elevations of 2,640 to 3,300 feet. Slopes are dominantly 0 to 2 percent and range from O to 10 percent. These soils formed in mixed alluvium from sandstone, limestone, and shale. The mean annual temperature is 57 to 65 F., and the mean summer temperature is 80 to 84 F. The average annual precipitation is 8 to 11 inches. The frost free period ranges from 190 to 200 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Hantz, Isom, Junction, LaVerkin, Nikey, and Tobler soils. Hantz soils have more than 35 percent clay in the control section. Isom soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments. Junction and Tobler soils are coarse-loamy, and LaVerkin soils have calcic horizons. Nikey soils have a layer of carbonate accumulation and have coarse-loamy control sections.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well-drained; medium runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Irrigated cropland and rangeland. Crops are alfalfa, small grains, sorghum, and sugar beets for seed. Native vegetation is creosote bush, galleta, filaree, and cholla.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwestern Utah. This soil occurs in LRR-D, MLRA 30.  These soils are inextensive.
