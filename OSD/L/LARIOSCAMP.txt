LARIOSCAMP SERIES

The Larioscamp series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils with slow permeability that formed in alluvium and loess from basalt and welded rhyolitic tuff.  Larioscamp soils are on calderas and foothills and have slopes of 1 to 10 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the average annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Xeric Argidurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Larioscamp loam -- on a west-facing slope of 5 percent in native rangeland at 1,665 meter elevation.  (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise stated.  When described on June 15, 1981, the soil was moist to 38 cm and slightly moist below.)

    A--0 to 8 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, few medium roots; many very fine and fine vesicular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 23 cm thick)

    Bt1--8 to 23 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine, few medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular and interstitial pores; many faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (13 to 28 cm thick)

    Bt2--23 to 38 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; strong fine and medium angular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine, few medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 18 cm thick)

    2Bkq--38 to 64 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/4) very cobbly sandy loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots; 25 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles (rock fragments have carbonate and silica coatings up to 2 cm thick); violent effervescence; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 43 cm thick)

    2Bkqm--64 to 74 cm; white (10YR 8/2) indurated duripan, light gray (10YR 7/2) moist; massive; extremely hard, brittle; violent effervescence; abrupt wavy boundary. (3 to 25 cm thick)

    3R--74 cm; slightly fractured welded rhyolitic tuff with silica and carbonate filling fractures.

TYPE LOCATION:  Owyhee County, Idaho; about 15 miles south and 14 miles east of Grasmere; about 2,200 feet south and 1,800 feet west of the northeast corner of sec. 34, T. 14 S., R. 7 E.; USGS The Arch 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 42 degrees 10 minutes 00 seconds N and longitude 115 degrees 37 minutes 04 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 42.1666667 latitude, -115.6177778 longitude.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ratsow and Tock (T) series.  Ratsow soils have carbonates at 46 to 64 cm.  Tock soils are greater than 100 cm to bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Larioscamp soils occur on nearly level to sloping calderas, structural benches, and foothills at elevations of 1,620 to 1,815 meters.  Slopes range from 1 to 10 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium and loess from basalt, welded rhyolitic tuff and volcanic ash.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and warm and dry in the summer.  Average annual precipitation is 280 to 330 cm and average annual temperature is 5.6 to 7.2 degrees C.  The frost-free season is 70 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brace, Dishpan and Freshwater series.  These soils have less than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Dishpan soils lack a duripan.  Freshwater soils are less than 50 cm to duripan.  These soils are on similar landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow or medium runoff; slow saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The dominant natural vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Sandberg bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Idaho.  This series is not extensive. MLRA 25.
