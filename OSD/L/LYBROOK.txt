LYBROOK SERIES

The Lybrook series consists of very deep, well drained slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from shale and sandstone. Lybrook soils are on stream terraces and valley floors.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Ustic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lybrook clay loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 1 inch; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine and fine continuous pores; slightly  effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (1 to 3 inches thick)

    C1--1 to 5 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; hard, very firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear gradual boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    C2--5 to 21 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 20 inches thick)

    C3--21 to 30 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few very fine roots; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 15 inches thick)

    C4--30 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine roots; very strongly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Sandoval County, New Mexico; 15 miles south of Lybrook; 2640 feet north and 2640 feet east of the southwest corner of sec. 3, T.  21 N., R. 7 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture:  Usually dry, typically dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section from April 15 to July 1.  The soil moisture control section is moist in some part periodically from July 1 through October and moist intermittently from November to April 15. Ustic aridic moisture regime.

Soil temperature:  52 to 56 degrees F.

Particle-size control section - clay content:  35 to 45 percent

A horizon
Hue: 10YR, 2.5Y
Value: 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist
Texture: silt loam, clay loam

C horizon
Hue: 10YR, 2.5Y
Value: 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 2 through 4, dry or moist
Texture: clay loam, silty clay loam, clay
Other features:  In some pedons, thin strata of sandy loam, silt loam or clay.  The exchangeable sodium percentage below 30 inches ranges from 15 to 50.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Vermejo series. Vermejo soils occur in LRR-G MLRA 70A and typically are dry from November through March and are moist in some part from April 15 to July 1.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lybrook soils are on stream terraces and valley floors. They formed in alluvium derived from shale and sandstone. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Elevations are 6,000 to 7,000 feet. Mean annual precipitation is 8 to 14 inches. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F., and the frost-free period is about 110 to 165 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Blancot, Councelor, and Tsosie soils.  Blancot soils have an argillic horizon. Councelor and Tsosie soils have less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Lybrook soils are used for livestock grazing.  The native vegetation is alkali sacaton, galleta, fourwing saltbush, greasewood and shadscale.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern New Mexico.  MLRA 35. Series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Sandoval County, New Mexico, 1987.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 1 inch (A horizon)

Ustic feature - Aridic soil moisture regime bordering on ustic

Entisol feature - the lack of diagnostic horizons within the zone from about 1 to 40 inches (C1, C2, C3, C4 horizons)

Soil Classified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.
