LELA SERIES

The Lela series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in clayey alluvium. These soils are on nearly level to slightly concave flood plains in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 15 degrees C (59 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 860 mm (34 in).

Asher, Braman, Brewer, Dale, Keokuk, McLain, and Reinach soils: occur on similar landform positions
Gaddy, Miller, Port, and Yahola soils: occur on lower flood plains closer to the stream channel 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage: somewhat poorly drained
Permeability: slow
Runoff: slow
Flooding: rarely or occasionally flooded for very brief periods during April to October

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly cultivated to small grains, grain sorghums, and alfalfa. Minor areas are used for tame pasture or rangeland. Native vegetation consists of tall and mid grasses with a small percentage of hardwood trees. The main trees are pecan, American elm, and eastern cottonwood.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Oklahoma and Kansas; LRR H, Central Rolling Red Prairies, MLRA 80A; the series is moderately extensive.
