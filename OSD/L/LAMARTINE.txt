LAMARTINE SERIES

The Lamartine series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loess and in the underlying loamy till on ground moraines and interdrumlin areas.  Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 864 mm (34 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 7.8 degrees C (46 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquollic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Lamartine silt loam - on a 2 percent slope in a cultivated field at an elevation of about 271 meters (880 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

  Ap--0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; very friable; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. [15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 inches) thick]

  E--23 to 28 cm (9 to 11 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) and very pale brown (10YR 7/3) dry; silt loam; weak medium platy structure; friable; common fine distinct brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. [0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 inches) thick] 

  Bt1--28 to 36 cm (11 to 14 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; firm; few faint very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) organo-clay films on faces of peds; common fine distinct brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; common fine faint dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) iron depletions in the matrix; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. [8 to 15 cm (3 to 6 inches) thick] 

  Bt2--36 to 64 cm (14 to 25 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) silty clay loam; moderate very fine subangular blocky structure; firm; few faint very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay films on faces of peds; common fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; common fine faint light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) iron depletions in the matrix; neutral; clear smooth boundary. [20 to 31 cm (8 to 12 inches) thick] 

  2Bt3--64 to 76 cm (25 to 30 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam; moderate fine subangular structure; firm; common faint very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay films on faces of peds; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; common medium faint light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) iron depletions in the matrix; about 2 percent gravel; neutral; clear smooth boundary. [5 to 20 cm (2 to 8 inches) thick] 

  2C--76 to 200 cm (30 to 79 inches); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy loam; massive; very friable; many medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation in the matrix; common fine distinct light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) iron depletions in the matrix; about 10 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline. 

TYPE LOCATION: Jefferson, Wisconsin; about 1mile north of Ixonia; 2,640 feet south and 100 feet west from the northwest corner of sec. 16, T. 8 N., R. 16 E. USGS Ixonia, Wisconsin topographic quadrangle; lat. 43 degrees 9 minutes 32 seconds N., and long. 88 degrees 35 minutes 51 seconds W., NAD 27; UTM Zone 16, 370114 easting and 4779703 northing, NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Depth to the base of the argillic horizon: 61 to 102 cm (24 to 40 inches)
Thickness of the loess mantle: 51 to 91 cm (20 to 36 inches)
Particle-size control section: averages 25 to 35 percent clay
Volume of gravel: 0 to 15 percent in 2Bt horizon and ranges from 5 to 50 percent in the 2C horizon
Volume of cobbles: 0 to 3 percent in the 2Bt and 2C horizons
Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the upper part of the solum and ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline in the lower part, and is slightly or moderately alkaline in the substratum.  
Redox features and saturation:  typically throughout the soil below the Ap horizon; redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less in the upper 25 cm (10 inches) of the argillic horizon 

Ap or A horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 2 or 3
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: silt loam.

The E horizon (where present):
Hue: 10YR
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: silt loam.

Bt horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 3 to 6
Texture: silty clay loam and, less commonly, silt loam.

2Bt horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or N
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 0 to 6
Texture: clay loam or loam.  
Other features:
Carbonates are in the lower part of the 2Bt horizon in some pedons.

2C horizon: 
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: loam, but the range includes sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly analogs. 
Sand content: 40 to 70 percent
Calcium carbonate equivalent; 20 to 60 percent

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Millstream series.  Millstream soils have more than 75 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section.   

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lamartine soils typically are on nearly level to sloping ridgetops and foot slopes of ground moraines and interdrumlin areas.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. These soils formed in loess and in the underlying loamy till.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 890 mm (27 to 35 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.2 to 11.7 degrees C (45 to 53 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dodge, Kendall, and Mayville soils. The well drained Dodge and the moderately well drained Mayville are common associates on the somewhat steeper gradients.  Kendall soils are on nearby areas of similar slopes where loess thickens beyond 91 cm (36 inches).

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  Potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderate. These soils have an apparent seasonal high water table at a depth of 31 to 76 cm (1 to 2.5 feet) for some time in most years.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of the soil is used for cropland. Common crops are corn, small grain, and hay. Native vegetation is primarily deciduous forest with maple-basswood and oak-hickory predominating.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  MLRAs 95A, and 95B in southeastern Wisconsin and northern Illinois.  The Lamartine soils are of moderate extent.
