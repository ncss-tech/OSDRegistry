LEVIATHAN SERIES

The Leviathan series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from granitic rocks.  Leviathan soils are on stream terraces and fan remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

Lemm soils average 10 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Nosrac soils have mollic epipedons 36 to 50 cm thick, hue of 5Y in lower subhorizons, and have less than 35 percent coarse sand plus very coarse sand.  Oest soils average 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have very gravelly loamy sand or very gravelly sand within 150 cm of the soil surface.  Shawmount soils have depth to base of the argillic horizon of 50 to 100 cm.  Shree soils have depth to base of the argillic horizon of 50 to 90 cm.  Shroe soils have depth to base of the argillic horizon of 50 to 89 cm and have upper subhorizons with 35 to 45 percent clay.  Tristan soils are deep to lithic contacts. Tollgate soils have 35 to 50 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Leviathan soils are on stream terraces and fan remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from granitic rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,460 to 2,140 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 75 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Oest soil and the Chalco and Reno soils.  Chalco soils are clayey, shallow to paralithic contacts, and have ochric epipedons.  Reno soils are fine, moderately deep to duripans, and have ochric epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium to very high surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Leviathan soils are used for livestock grazing, urban development, and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, desert needlegrass, and cheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada and eastern California.  These soils are moderately extensive.  The series concept and main acreage is in MLRA 26, while other acreage occurs in MLRA 23.
