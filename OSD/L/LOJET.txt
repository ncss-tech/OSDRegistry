Arbidge and Dacker soils have Bk or Bqk horizons underlying the argillic horizon and above the duripan. Deerlodge soils do not have calcic horizons in the lower part of the argillic. Ditchcamp soils have bedrock underlying the duripan within 64 to 100 cm. Exel and Rakane soils do not have carbonates. Hager and Wako soils have bedrock between 100 and 150 cm. Idow soils have less than 5 percent rock fragments. Snowmore and Wendell soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact.  Wellsed soils have mostly fine gravel of granitic lithology. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lojet soils are on fan remnants and erode fan remnants. These soils formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff with a component of volcanic ash. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevation ranges from 1,370 to 2,130 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost free period is 100 to 130 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Devildog, Littleailie, and Qwynn series. Devildog soils do not have argillic horizons or duripans and are on inset fans. Littleailie soils are shallow to a duripan. Qwynn soils do not have a duripan. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; low to medium runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Lojet soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The potential native vegetation includes Wyoming big sagebrush, Nevada ephedra, fourwing saltbush, and Indian ricegrass. This pedon is correlated to Ecological Site R029XY006NV, Loamy 8-10 P.Z.
