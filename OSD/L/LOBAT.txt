LOBAT SERIES

The Lobat series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in colluvium from igneous and metamorphic rocks.  Lobat soils are on mountain footslopes.  Slopes are 15 to 60 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is about 4.4 degrees C., and mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Udic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lobat gravelly loam - forested.  (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.)

     Oi--0 to 3 cm; slightly decomposed organic matter (0 to 8 cm thick).

     A--3 to 18 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few coarse and medium and many fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent cobbles and 15 percent gravel; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 15 cm thick)

     E--18 to 51 cm; pink (7.5YR 7/4) gravelly clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common medium, fine and very fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 5 percent cobbles and 15 percent gravel; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 33 cm thick)

     Bt--51 to 122 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) gravelly clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and very fine roots; common fine tubular pores; common moderately thick clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent cobbles and 20 percent gravel; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (61 to 97 cm thick)

     C--122 to 155 cm; pink (7.5YR 7/4) gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 5 percent cobbles and 15 percent gravel; neutral.

COMPETING SERIES:  
Eaglecreek (MT) - are moderately deep to lithic contact

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform - mountain slopes
Elevation - 2,500 to 2,990 meters
Slopes - 15 to 60 percent
Parent material - colluvium derived from igneous and metamorphic rocks  
Mean annual air temperature - 4.4 to 6.1 degrees C.  
Mean annual precipitation - 560 to 710 mm 
Frost-free period - 70 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very high runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Lobat soils are used mainly for wood production and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is aspen, Douglas fir, white fir with scattered Ponderosa pine and Colorado blue spruce.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central New Mexico, south-central Colorado.  LRR D, E; MLRA 36, 48A.  The series is of moderate extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, 1989.  The series name is taken from a nearby railroad depot.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Argillic horizon - 51 to 119 cm (Bt horizon)
Particle-size control section - 51 to 101 cm (upper 50 cm of the Bt horizon)

Lobat soils have a frigid temperature regime and are in an ustic soil moisture regime bordering on udic.
