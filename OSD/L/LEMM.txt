LEMM SERIES

The Lemm series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium or colluvium derived mainly from granitic or rhyolitic rock. Lemm soils are on alluvial fans or concave colluvial slopes.  Slopes range from 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lemm very gravelly coarse sandy loam, rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). The surface is covered with about 35 percent gravel.

    A1--0 to 8 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 10 cm thick)

    A2--8 to 25 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly coarse sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and common fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 30 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.  (13 to 25 cm thick)

    A3--25 to 48 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium and coarse roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.  (15 to 30 cm thick)

    Bt1--48 to 74 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine interstitial pores; common faint clay films coating and bridging sand grains; 40 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (20 to 30 cm thick)

    Bt2--74 to 102 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; common faint clay films coating and bridging sand grains; 35 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (20 to 30 cm thick)

    C--102 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly loamy coarse sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 35 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2).

TYPE LOCATION:  Washoe County, Nevada; approximately 9 miles northwest of Reno on the west side of Lemmon Valley; about 1,000 feet north of the southeast corner of section 35, T. 21 N., R. 18 E.; USGS Reno NW 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 38 minutes 19 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 55 minutes 20 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.6386111 latitude, -119.9222222 longitude.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ashue, Badena, Badenaugh, Eaglerock, Gitabyte, Ginrod, Ister, Leviathan, Nosrac, Oest, Searles, Searvar, Shawmount, Shree, Shroe, Tollgate, Trid, and Tristan series.  

Ashue, Badena, Badenaugh, Leviathan, Nosrac, Oest, Shawmount, Shree, Shroe, Tollgate, and Tristan soils have more than l8 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Eaglerock, Gitabyte, Ginrod, Ister, Searles, Searvar and Trid soils have bedrock within 100 cm.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lemm soils are on alluvial fans and on concave colluvial slopes at elevations of 1,635 to 2,290 meters.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Lemm soils formed in mixed alluvium and colluvium derived mainly from granitic or rhyolitic rock.  The climate is cool, semi-arid with a mean annual temperature of 7 to 10 degrees C, and mean annual precipitation of 250 to 300 mm.  Frost-free season is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Greenbrae and Duco soils.  Greenbrae soils have a fine-loamy control section.  Duco soils are shallow to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately rapid permeability; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Lemm soils are used principally for range, recreation and urban development.  The vegetation is big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, rabbitbrush, squirreltail, cheatgrass and balsamroot.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Reno area of southwestern Washoe County, Nevada.  The series is of small extent. MLRA 26.
