LEELANAU SERIES

The Leelanau series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in sandy and loamy deposits on moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, frigid Alfic Haplorthods

TYPICAL PEDON: Leelanau loamy sand , on a southwest-facing, 5 percent slope in a forested area at an elevation of 335 meters (1,098 feet) above mean sea level. Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Keweenaw, Mancelona, Melita, and Southwells series. Keweenaw soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 132 cm (52 inches) inches. Mancelona soils average more than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Melita soils do not have loamy sand texture in the lower part of the series control section. Southwells soils have an E/B horizon that is more than 41 cm (16 inches) thick.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Leelanau soils are on ground moraines and end moraines of Wisconsinan Age. Slopes predominantly are 6 to 25 percent but range from 0 to 50 percent. Leelanau soils formed in sandy and loamy deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 864 mm (27 to 34 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 4.4 to 7.2 degrees C (40 to 45 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Au Gres, Edmore, Emmet, Ensley, Kalkaska, Otisco, Roscommon, and Rubicon soils. The excessively drained sandy Rubicon and somewhat excessively drained Kalkaska soils are on similar landscape positions. The well drained or moderately well drained Emmet soils are nearby where the till is sandy loam. The somewhat poorly drained Au Gres and Otisco soils and the poorly drained or very poorly drained Roscommon, Edmore, and Ensley soils are nearby in drainageways and depressions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium depending on the slope. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high. Permeability is moderately rapid. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of this soil are forested with American beech, sugar maple, and some eastern white pine. Some areas are cropped to hay and small grain. Other areas are in permanent pasture.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 94A and 96 in the northern part of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. The series is of large extent.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
 Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 7 cm (2 inches) (A, E horizons).
 Albic horizon: from a depth of 5 to 18 cm (2 to 7 inches) (E horizon). 
Spodic horizon: from a depth of 30 to 41 cm (12 to 16 inches) (Bs1 horizon).
 Glossic horizon: from a depth of 53 to 94 cm (21 to 37 inches) (E/B horizon).
 Argillic horizon: from a depth of 94 to 132 cm (37 to 52 inches) (Bt horizon).

The concept of lamella bands making up the Bt horizon is no longer in the range of characteristics. This would be a different classification.
