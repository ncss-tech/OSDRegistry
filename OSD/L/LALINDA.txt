LALINDA SERIES

The Lalinda series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy, eolian deposits.  These nearly level to sloping soils are on convex sloping coastal ridges.  Slope ranges from 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 23 degrees C (73 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, hyperthermic Typic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lalinda sandy clay loam--on a convex ridge; 3 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 6 feet. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    By2--97 to 142 cm (38 to 56 in); light gray (2.5Y 7/2) sandy clay loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; few fine roots; many threads and films of salt below 42 inches; saline; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of By horizons 35 to 97 cm [14 to 36 in].)

    By3--142 to 203 cm (56 to 80 in); light gray (2.5Y 7/2) sandy clay loam, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable; few fine roots; many threads and films of salt; saline; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Willacy County, Texas; from the intersection of U.S. Highway 77 and Texas Highway 186 on the east side of Raymondville; about 24 miles east on Texas Highway 186 to Port Mansfield; 1.1 miles east on top of ridge in rangeland; Port Mansfield, Texas USGS topographic quadrangle: Latitude: 26 degrees, 32 minutes 32 seconds N; Longitude: 97 degrees, 25 minutes, 9 seconds W.; NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil Moisture: An ustic soil moisture regime.  The soil moisture control section is 10 to 30 cm (4 to 12 in) from the surface.  These soils remain dry in some parts of the moisture control section for 90 or more cumulative days in normal years.  The driest periods occur in late winter to early spring and during mid-summer.
Mean annual soil temperature: 22 to 24 degrees C (72 to 76 degrees F)

Particle-size control section (weighted average)
Clay content: 25 to 35 percent
CEC/clay ratio: 0.40 to 0.60
EC (dS/m): 4 to 20 (increases with depth)
Buried A and B horizons are present in some pedons below depths of 51 cm (20 in)
Salic horizons occur in some pedons below depths of 102 cm (40 in)

SAR: 5 to 20
Identifiable secondary carbonate: amount-none to common, size-fine or medium

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Similar soils are the Dill (OK), Hext (TX), and Weymouth (TX) series.
Dill and Hext soils: have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section and have a thermic temperature regime
Weymouth soils: have a superactive CEC class and in a thermic temperature regime

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loamy eolian deposits derived from Holocene age sediments
Landform: dune on the windward side of saline flats on the coastal plain
Slope: 1 to 8 percent
Mean annual air temperature range: 22 to 23 degrees C (71 to 73 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation range: 635 to 889 mm (25 to 35 in)
Precipitation Pattern: Typically, May, June, and September are the wettest months.  The driest months are December through March.
Frost-free period: 319 to 341 days
Elevation: 2 to 8 meters (5 to 25 ft)
Thornthwaite P-E Index: 31 to 44

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arrada, Barrada, Latina, Saucel, and Sauz series.
Arrada, Barrada, Latina, and Saucel soils: higher EC and occur on flats adjacent to bays at slightly lower landforms
Sauz soils: have a natric horizon and are further inland on nearly level landforms.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Runoff is medium on slopes from 1 to 5 percent and high on slopes from 5 to 8 percent.  These soils are very rarely flooded for very brief periods by sea water during severe tropical storms.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used as wildlife habitat and livestock grazing.  Native vegetation consists of a giant sacaton, false Rhodes grass, Arizona cottontop, buffalograss, fall witchgrass, and miscellaneous shrubs.  Ecological site is Coastal Ridge, PE 31-44 (R150BY647TX).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Gulf Coast Saline Prairies (MLRA 150B in LRR T) in southern Texas.  The series is of minor extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Willacy County, Texas, 1980.

REMARKS:  Lalinda soils were formerly included in the Point Isabel series.  The series classification was changed from Aridisols to Inceptisols after the EC class criteria for Aridisols was dropped.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section: 25 to 102 cm (10 to 40 in). (Bw1, Bw2, By1 and By2 horizons)
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 in). (A1 and A2 horizons)
Cambic horizon: 15 to 203 cm (6 to 80 in). (Bw1, Bw2, By1. By2, By3 horizons)
