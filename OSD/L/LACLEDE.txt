LACLEDE SERIES

The LaClede series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium on older alluvial fans or terraces.  These soils have moderate permeability.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON:  LaClede silt loam on a nearly level alluvial terrace, rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A1--0 to 4 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak thin platy structure; soft, very friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine roots; slightly effervescent, lime disseminated; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)

    B2--4 to 13 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) silty clay loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; hard, very friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine roots; slightly effervescent, lime disseminated; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 17 inches thick)

    B3ca--13 to 24 inches; pale yellow l(5Y 7/3) silt loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, sticky and plastic; few very fine and fine roots; strongly effervescent, lime in seams and streaks;moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (7 to 20 inches thick)

    C--24 to 70 inches; pale yellow (5Y 7/3) silt loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, sticky and plastic; few very fine roots; strongly effervescent, few fine and medium irregular soft masses and disseminated in matrix; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Sweetwater County, Wyoming; center of Sec. 26, T19N, R98W; 220 feet southeast of dirt road and 500 feet south of twin gas tanks.  About 3 miles south of Table Rock service station.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is 15 to 35 inches thick.  The mean annual soil temperature is 44 degrees to 47 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature is 62 degrees to 68 degrees F.  Coarse fragments are absent in most pedons but may range up to 5 percent.  Carbonates range from 5 to 15 percent clay, 45 to 82 percent silt, and 0 to 20 percent sand with less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.

The A horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR; value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist; and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay.  Reaction ranges from mildly to moderately alkaline.  E.C. is 0.5 to 4 mmhos/cm.

The B horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR; value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist; and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from mildly to strongly alkaline.  E.C. is 0.5 to 4 mmhos/cm.

The C or Cca horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR; value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist; and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from moderately to strongly alkaline.  E.C. is 0.5 to 4 mmhos/cm.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this class but the Sagecreek soils are similar.  Sagecreek soils have fine-loamy control sections.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  LaClede soils are on late Pleistocene or early Holocene alluvial fans or terraces.  They formed in uniform silty alluvium.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevation ranges from 6,000 to 7,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 6 to 9 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer air temperature is about 61 degrees to 66 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 80 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dines soils (proposed) and the competing Sagecreek soils.  Dines soils are Torrifluvents and occupy more unstable terraces.  The Sagecreek soils normally occupy upslope positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for domestic livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is big sagebrush, Sandberg bluegrass, thickspike wheatgrass, Indian ricegrass, Gardner saltbush, bottlebrush squirreltail, and bud sage.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Wyoming.  These soils are of minor extent.
