LAHTI SERIES

The Lahti series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of loamy glaciolacustrine and the underlying sandy glaciolacustrine deposits. These soils are on slight convex rises on glacial lake plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 670 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Aquic Argiudolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Lahti very fine sandy loam, on slight rises of 2 percent, in a cultivated field, on a glacial lake plain, at an elevation of about 400 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Ap--0 to 28 centimeters; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) very fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak fine and moderate granular structure; very friable; common fine and very fine roots; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. (20 to 33 centimeters thick)

    E--28 to 36 centimeters; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam; weak fine platy structure; very friable; common fine and very fine roots; moderately acid; abrupt wavy boundary. (5 to 15 centimeters thick)

    Bt--36 to 66 centimeters; brown (10YR 4/3) silty clay loam; moderate fine angular blocky structure; firm; common fine roots; few distinct dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) clay films on faces of peds; neutral; clear wavy boundary. (13 to 51 centimeters thick)

    Bk--66 to 112 centimeters; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) silt loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine and very fine roots; many fine faint light gray (10YR 7/1) nodules of calcium carbonate; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; common medium distinct light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) redoximorphic depletions; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary. (25 to 51 centimeters thick)

    2C1--112 to 130 centimeters; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) loamy fine sand; single grain; loose; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.

    2C2--130 to 203 centimeters; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) loamy fine sand; single grain; loose; common fine and medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) 88-Northern Minnesota Glacial Lake Basins; St. Louis County, Minnesota, Meadowlands subset; about 1 mile north and 1.5 miles west of Meadowlands; located about 350 feet south and 1,000 feet west of the northwest corner of section 16, T. 53 N., R. 19 W.; USGS Elmer topographic quadrangle; latitude 47 degrees 04 minutes 57.1 seconds N., and longitude 92 degrees 45 minutes 42.5 seconds W., NAD 83.

Reaction--moderately acid to neutral

Bt horizon:
Hue--10YR to 5Y
Value--4 to 6
Chroma--1 to 3
Texture--silty clay loam or silt loam; the clay content ranges from 18 to 35 percent
Reaction--slightly acid or neutral

Bk horizon:

Some pedons have thin, discontinuous loamy strata within the underlying sandy deposit.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--loamy glaciolacustine deposits and the underlying sandy glaciolacustrine deposits
Landform--slight convex rises on glacial lake plains
Slope--1 to 3 percent
Elevation--350 to 490 meters above sea level
Mean annual air temperature--3 to 5 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation--635 to 711 millimeters
Frost-free period--95 to 125 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Gowan soil. Gowan soil forms a hydrosequence with the Lahti soils.
Gowan soils are on less sloping and lower lying positions on the landscape.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--somewhat poorly drained--a frequently saturated zone occurs between 0.4 and 0.6 meters during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation, this saturation is considered apparent
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--1.41 to 14.11 micrometers per second in the upper mantle and 4.23 to 141.14 micrometers per second in the underlying sand.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cropped for hay.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Physiographic Division--Interior Plains or Laurentian Upland
Physiographic Province--Central Lowland or Superior Upland
MLRA--Northern Minnesota Glacial Lake Basins (88)
LRR--K; northern Minnesota
