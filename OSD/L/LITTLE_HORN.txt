LITTLE HORN SERIES

The Little Horn series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum from limestone, quartzite, or sandstone. These soils are on mountains and foothills. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic Ustic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Little Horn stony loam, in native grassland (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 A--0 to 4 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) stony loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 10 percent stones; 10 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual wavy boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick)

 Bt1--4 to 7 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; coatings of very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to weak fine and medium subangular blocky; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many fine tubular pores; continuous faint clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent stones; 10 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick)

 Bt2--7 to 12 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/3) clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; dark brown (10YR 3/3) coats on prisms; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; continuous faint clay films on all surfaces of peds; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick)

 Bk1--12 to 18 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/3) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, moderately plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; patches of clay films on surfaces of peds and on gravel in upper part of horizon; strong effervescence with lime disseminated and as lime flour coats on gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); clear smooth boundary.

 Bk2--18 to 30 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; common medium prominent reddish brown mottles in lower part; massive; hard, friable; few roots; strong effervescence with accumulated lime disseminated; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear irregular boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bk horizons is 10 to 20 inches thick.)

 C--30 to 35 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) and reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky, moderately plastic; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick)

 R--35 inches; hard limestone bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow permeability

USE AND VEGETATION: Little Horn soils are used mainly for range with some used for production of hay and oats. The potential native vegetation is mainly grasses, including bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, rough fescue, and fringed sagewort.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Little Horn soils are not extensive in the eastern slopes of the northern Rocky Mountains; MLRA 43B and 46.

Series Established: Sheridan County, Wyoming, 1932

Remarks:

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
- a mollic epipedon from the surface to 12 inches (A, Bt horizons)
- an argillic horizon which is the particle-size control section from 4 to 12 inches (Bt horizons)
- horizons of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation from 12 to 30 inches (Bk horizons)
- a lithic contact at 35 inches (R horizon)

Little Horn soils have an ustic moisture regime and a cryic temperature regime.

The Little Horn OSD does not list a range of frost-free days. NASIS ranges are from 50 to 125. Frost-free season needs to be investigated.
