LITTLEPINE SERIES

The Littlepine series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or slope alluvium derived from sandstone.  Littlepine soils are on fan remnants and hills.  Slopes range from 3 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Littlepine fine sandy loam, on a southeast facing, 12 percent slope in pine trees at an elevation of 7,250 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on July 12, 2000 the soil was moist from 0 to 30 inches.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Las Animas County, Colorado, 2007; Las Animas and parts of Huerfano  County soil survey area, Colorado.  The name is coined from a canyon in the area.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: The zone from 6 to 26 inches.  (Bt1 and part of Bt2 horizons)
argillic horizon: The zone from 6 to 48 inches.  (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons)
This soil was originally part of the Maitland series.  The Maitland series was reclassified as having a udic moisture regime.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
