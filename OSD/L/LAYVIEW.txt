LAYVIEW SERIES

The Layview series consists of very shallow orshallow, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesite, rhyolite, chert and tuff. Layview soils are on convex mountain ridges. Slopes are 4 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Lithic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Layview very gravely sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is covered with 10 percent stones, 15 percent cobbles and 50 percent gravel.

    A--0 to 6 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common  very fine roots; many very fine interstial pores; 35 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary (6 to 20 cm thick)

    Bt1--6 to 19 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; few thin clay film lining pores; 30 percent gravel, 10 cobbles 2 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt wavy boundary. (10 to 25 cm thick)

    Bt2--19 to 38 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 20 percent moderately thick clay films lining pores; 50 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles and 2 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt irregular boundary. (0 to 20 cm thick)

    2R--38 cm, fractured andesitic tuff.

TYPE LOCATION: Lander County, Nevada, about 41 miles southwest of Austin, approximately 2,550 feet east and 2,000 feet south of northwest corner of section 31, R. 38 E., T. 16 N. latitude 39 degrees 23 minutes 3.9 seconds N and longitude 117 degrees 44 minutes 55.5 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.3844167 latitude, -117.7487500 longitude.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bushpark, Copenhaver, Donkehill, Hogmalat, Maygal, Mosroc, Mountpatterson, Nielson, Nieman, Notstew and Thiefridge series. 

Bushpark soils have a udic soil moisture regime. Copenhaver, Donkehill, Mountpatterson, Neiman and Nielsen soils have a mean annual soil temperature less than 6 degrees C. Hogmalat soils are strongly to medium acid throughout. Maygal have more than 60 percent rock fragments.  Mosroc soils formed in weathered material derived dominantly from granite and the mollic epipedon includes the entire argillic horizon. Notstew soils have more than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon. Thiefridge soils have a typic xeric soil moisture regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Layview soils are on convex mountain ridges. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from rhyolite, andesite, chert and  tuffaceous rocks. Slopes are 4 to 75 percent. Elevations are 2,134 to 3,048 meters. The climate is cool, semi-arid with a mean annual precipitation ranging from 300 to 400 mm; mean annual temperature is 5 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 50 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hapgood, Packer, and Mosquet series. Hapgood and Packer are deep soils, Mosquet is clayey-skeletal and ruptic.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; runoff is medium or very rapid; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is Sandberg bluegrass, Idaho fescue, phlox and low sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Nevada. Layview soils are of small extent.  MLRA 27, 28B, 24.
