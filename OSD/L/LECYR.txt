LECYR SERIES

The Lecyr series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rock. The Lecyr soils are on ballenas. Slopes range from 4 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 15 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are no competing series currently.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Lecyr soils are on ballenas. Slopes range from 4 to 30 percent. The soils formed in alluvium derived from igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rock. Elevation ranges from 1320 to 1570 meters. The mean annual precipitation is 175 to 225 mm. The mean annual temperature is about 13 to 17 degrees C. The frost-free period is 210 to 270 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Minehart, Parched, Sagamore, Stonekey, and Vegasglow soils. Minehart, Parched and Vegasglow soils are on mountains and have argillic horizons. Sagamore and Stonekey soils are on fan remnants, have carbonatic minerology and have petrocalcic horizons. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; low runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Lecyr soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is big galleta, black grama, blackbrush, and Joshua tree.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Basin and Range of California, U.S.A.; MLRA 30. The series is of small extent.
