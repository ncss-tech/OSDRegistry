LICK SERIES

The Lick series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till or colluvium derived from granite and gneiss. These soils are on moraines and hills. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 457 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Ravalli County (Bitterroot Valley Area), Montana, 1914. The soil is named from a local creek.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  
Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 20 cm (A and E horizon);
Argillic horizon - from 20 to 98 cm (EBt & Bt horizons)
Particle-size control section - from 20 to 70 cm (the upper 50 cm of the argillic horizon)

Lick soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
