LENZ SERIES

The Lenz series consists of moderately deep, well-drained soils formed in material weathered from gneiss, schist, and granite, with small amounts of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. These soils are on mountain and foothill side slopes. Slopes range from 3 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches and mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, isotic, mesic Vitrandic Haploxerolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Lenz ashy loam - on a southwest-facing slope of 42 percent, forested, at 3,800 feet elevation. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated. When described the soil was slightly moist.)

(5 to 14 inches thick) 

   R--36 inches; fractured granite bedrock with few fines in cracks.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Borgeau, Emily, Garrison,  Louiecreek, Opportunity, Raisio, Sinlahekin, Speigle, Vanbrunt, and Whitestone series. Borgeau, Emily, Garrison, Louiecreek, Opportunity, Sinlahekin, Speigle, and Whitestone soils are more than 40 inches to bedrock. Raisio soils are dominated by 35 to 80 percent channers and flagstones. Vanbrunt soils have less than 8 percent clay and do not have stones in the particle-size control section 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lenz soils are on southeast to southwest-facing mountain and foothill side slopes at elevations of 1,700 to 4,000 feet. The slopes range from 3 to 65 percent. The soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from granite, gneiss, or schist, with small amounts of loess and volcanic ash mixed in the upper part of the profile. The mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 49 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 35 inches. The frost-free season is 90 to 130 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ardtoo, Kruse, Molly, Schumacher, Skalan, Spokane, and Ulricher soils. Ardtoo soils have a frigid soil temperature regime, are over 40 inches to bedrock and are on back slopes of mountains. Molly and Ulricher, soils have ochric epipedons, are not skeletal and are on back slopes of mountains. Kruse and Skalan soils have argillic horizons, ochric epipedons and are on footslopes of mountains. Schumacher soils have argillic horizons and are on footslopes of mountains. Spokane soils are coarse-loamy and are on back slopes of mountains. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well-drained. Runoff is medium to very rapid. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part of and high in the lower part. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for grazeable woodland, wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed. Potential natural vegetation is mainly Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine with an understory of common snowberry, mallow ninebark, creambush oceanspray, pine reedgrass, and bluebunch wheatgrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Idaho and eastern Washington; MLRA 43A. These soils are moderately extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Kootenai County, Idaho, 1976. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include: 
Mollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 12 inches (A and BA horizons) 
Cambic horizon - the zone from 12 to 23 inches (Bt horizon) 
Vitrandic feature - the zone from 0 to 12 inches (A and BA horizons) 
Ultic feature - the zone from 10 to 30 inches having a base saturation (sum) of less than 75 percent in one or more horizons 
Lithic contact - the zone beginning at 36 inches (R) 
Particle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 36 inches 

Classification revised 11/01 based on assumed ash influence of the surface and the associated soils in Kootenai and Spokane counties currently classified as Vitrandic subgroups. 

Lenz soils should be further investigated to determine typical mineralogy (isotic vs. mixed).
