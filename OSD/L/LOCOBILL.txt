LOCOBILL SERIES

The Locobill series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on hills and mountains.  These soils formed from granitic and metamorphic rocks.  Slopes range from 9 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches (38 cm), and the average annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.(12 degrees C.).

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haploxeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Locobill sandy loam, on a mountain slope of 43 percent under annual and perennial grasses, digger pine, oaks, buckbrush and pinyon pine at 4,350 feet elevation.

(2 to 5 inches thick)

    BAt-- 3 to 13 inches (8 to 33 cm); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, fine, and common medium and coarse roots; few very fine interstitial and few fine tubular pores; few thin clay films bridging mineral grains; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 12 inches thick)

    Bt1-- 13 to 28 inches (33 to 71 cm); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine, and common medium and coarse roots; few very fine interstitial pores; few thin clay films bridging mineral grains; 27 percent gravel, 3 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (9 to 15 inches thick)

    Bt2-- 28 to 35 inches (71 to 89 cm); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; few very fine interstitial pores; few moderately thick clay films on faces of peds and in pores, and common thin clay fims bridging mineral grains; 22 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

    Cr-- 35 to 45 inches (89 to 114 cm); partially decomposed granitic rock.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Depth to weathered rock: 20 to 40 inches 51 to 102 cm).

Soil Temperature - The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 59 degrees F.  The soil temperature is greater than 41 degrees F. from about Febuary 1 to December 15 (300 to 330                   days) and is greater than 47 degrees F from about March 1 to December 1 (250 to 290 days).

Soil Moisture - The soils are dry from about June 10 to November 1 (120 to 140 days). The soil is  moist in some or all parts for 90 or more days when the soil temperature is greater than 47 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Frigate and Wrightwood series.  Frigate soils are deep and isomesic.  Wrightwood soils are more than 60 inches deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Locobill soils are on mountain slopes of 9 to 60 percent slope.  These soils formed in material weathered from granitic and metamorphic rocks with small areas of  calcareous rocks occuring throughout the area.  Elevations are 3,200 to 5,500 feet(975 to 1676 meters).  Average annual precipitation is about 20 inches (510 mm).  The mean annual temperature is about 50 to 57 degrees F.(10 to 14 degrees C.)  The mean January temperature is about 38 to 43 degrees F.(3 to 6 degrees C.), mean July temperature is about 74 to 78 degrees F. (23 to 26 degrees C.), and the frost-free season is about 150 to 200 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arujo, Sesame, Tollhouse, Tweedy and Walong soils.   Arujo soils are fine-loamy and have a mollic epipedon.  Sesame soils are fine-loamy.  Tollhouse soils have a mollic epipedon and a paralithic contact within 20 inches of the surface.  Tweedy soils are fine-loamy and have a mollic epipedon.  Walong soils lack an argillic horizon and have a mollic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  This soil is used for watershed, livestock grazing, wildlife habitat and homesite development.  Native vegetation is mostly digger pine, blue oak, scrub oak, juniper, red brome, cheatgrass, ceonothus, and big sage.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Sierra Nevada Range in California.  This series is not extensive in MLRA 18.
