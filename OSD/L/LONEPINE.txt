LONEPINE SERIES

The Lonepine series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, glaciofluvial, or lacustrine deposits.  These soils are on lake plains and terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, active, frigid Calcic Haploxerepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lonepine silt loam, cultivated.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap--0 to 6 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; few very fine pores; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (3 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw--6 to 14 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (3 to 14 inches thick)

    Bk--14 to 19 inches; very pale browne (10YR 8/2) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium platy structure of varve remnants; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few roots and pores; disseminated lime and common medium soft masses of lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual irregular boundary. (4 to 17 inches thick)

    C--19 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive, consisting of 1/4- to 1/2-inch thick varves; very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

Elevation - 2,000 to 3,000 feet.
Slope - 0 to 20 percent.
Parent material - alluvium, glaciofluvial or lacustrine deposits.
Climate - long, cold winters; moist falls; moist springs; warm, dry summers.
Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 14 inches.
Mean annual temperature - 40 to 45 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 105 to 130 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Lonepine soils are mainly used as rangeland and irrigated and dry cropland.  Potential native vegetation is bluebunch wheatgrass, prairie junegrass, Sandberg bluegrass, and native forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Lonepine soils are moderately extensive in intermountain valleys in western Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lake County (Lower Flathead Valley Area), Montana, 1929.

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretation Record:  MT0662.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 6 inches (Ap horizon); a cambic horizon from 6 to 14 inches (Bw horizon); a horizon of lime accumulation from 14 to 19 inches (Bk horizon); varved lacustrine material from 19 to 60 inches (C horizon); and a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bw, Bk, and C horizons).  Lonepine soils have a frigid temperature regime and a xeric moisture regime that borders on aridic.
