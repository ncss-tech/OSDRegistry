COMPETING SERIES:  There are Pennsuco and Perrine series. 
Pennsuco soils have bedrock at depths greater than 100 centimeters, are derived from freshwater marsh deposits, and do not occur on landforms in the tidal zone that are very frequently flooded.
Perrine soils are formed in freshwater marsh deposits, have similar depths to limestone bedrock, and do not occur on landforms in the tidal zone that are very frequently flooded.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landscape: Lower Coastal Plain
Landform(s): marine and brackish marshes, swamps, or low broad coastal flats on the Key West Islands and/or along the southern coast of the Florida Peninsula	
Parent material: calcareous brackish silty marl deposits over oolitic limestone bedrock
Mean annual temperature: 24 to 27 degrees C (75 to 81 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 1397 to 1778 millimeters (55 to 70 inches)
Frost-free period: 365 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cudjoe, Islamorada, Keylargo, Keyvaca, Keywest, Matecumbe, Pennekamp, and Saddlebunch series. 
Cudjoe soils: have bedrock at depths less than 5 centimeters (20 inches) and occur on similar landform positions in the tidal zone.
Islamorada soils: have bedrock at depths of 50 to 100 centimeters, are entirely composed of sapric organic materials, and occur on similar landform positions in the tidal zone.
Keylargo soils: have bedrock at depths greater than 150 centimeters, are entirely composed of sapric organic materials, and occur on similar landform positions in the tidal zone.
Keyvaca soils: have bedrock at depths less than 25 centimeters, are composed of calcareous loamy material derived from limestone bedrock and occur on slightly higher landform positions.
Keywest soils: have bedrock at depths of greater than 150 centimeters, are stratified with silty marl sediments and sapric organic materials and occur on similar landform positions in the tidal zone.
Matecumbe soils: have bedrock at depths less than 25 centimeters, are composed of sapric organic materials, and occur on slightly higher landform positions.
Pennekamp soils: have bedrock at depths less than 25 centimeters, have rock fragments greater than 35 percent by volume, have better internal soil drainage, and occur on landform positions on upland rises.
Saddlebunch soils: have bedrock at depths 25 to 50 centimeters and are on slightly higher landform positions.
