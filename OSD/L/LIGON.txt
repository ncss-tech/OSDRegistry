LIGON SERIES

The Ligon series consists of well drained moderately deep soils to schist bedrock that formed in residuum weathered from schist. These gently sloping to moderately steep soils are on shoulders, backslopes and summits of ridges and hills underlain by schist bedrock of pre-Cambrian age. Slopes are 1 to 15 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C (66 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Rhodustalfs

Castell, Honeycreek, and Katemcy soils: occur lower on the landscape on undulating plains and footslopes of ridges and hills.
Castell soils: are 50 to 100 cm (20 to 40 in) to gneiss bedrock.
Honeycreek soils: have fine-loamy control sections
Keese soils:  Are less than 50 cm (less than 20 in) to granite bedrock and occur on similar positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderately slow. Runoff is medium on 1 to 5 percent slopes and high on 5 to 15 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for mainly for rangeland. Originally, the prairie had scattered oak with climax dominants that were mainly little bluestem, plains lovegrass, sideoats grama, and Arizona cottontop. Many areas are invaded by brushy species, mainly whitebrush, mesquite, and black persimmon and shorter grasses, including threeawn, annuals, and numerous forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Texas; Southwest Plateaus and Plains Range and Cotton Region, LRR-I; MLRA 82A-Texas Central Basin. This series is of large extent with about 125,000 acres.
