MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Charles County, Maryland, 2007. 

REMARKS: Liverpool soils were previously mapped as Elkton, Keyport, Mattapex, and Othello soils. 
Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 13 cm (A and E horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 13 to 163 cm (Bt and BCt horizons)
Aquic conditions--the soil has redox depletions and concentrations within
the upper 60 cm of the argillic horizon, with periodic saturation and
reduction at some time during the year
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 165 cm  

ADDITIONAL DATA: Reference particle-size data (U of MD lab) is available from the project soil survey staff for the following pedon: S02MD-017-003. Three pedons (MD04-017-003, MD04-017-005, MD04-017-006) have been sampled and sent to NSSL for complete characterization.
