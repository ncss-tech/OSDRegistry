LIVCO SERIES

The Livco series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium derived from igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rock.  These nearly level soils occur on flats on low coastal plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1042 mm (41 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (71.6 degrees F).

USE AND VEGETATION:  
Used for cropland and rangeland.  Most cropland is in a rice-unimproved pasture rotation.  A few areas are used for corn and grain sorghum.  Native grasses are salt tolerant species such as gulf cordgrass, marshhay cordgrass, little bluestem and Indiangrass.  Woody invaders are mesquite, bushy sea-oxeye and cactus.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas
SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Jackson County, Texas; 1991.

REMARKS:  These soils where formerly included in the Livia series.  Based on the soil moisture study of other similar soils (ISCOM VIII, Classification and Management of Wet Soils, 1990), these soils do not have an aquic moisture regime.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - 0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in) (Ap and A horizon)
Natric horizon - 20 to 152 cm (8 to 60 in) (Btn and Btkn horizon)
Redoximorphic features - 20 to 203 cm (8 to 80 in)
