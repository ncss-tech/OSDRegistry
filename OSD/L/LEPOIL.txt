LEPOIL SERIES

The Lepoil series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in marine deposits derived from mixed sources.  Lepoil soils are on nearly level to steeply sloping, dissected marine terraces and have slopes 0 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1500 millimeters (59 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, isomesic Typic Palehumults

TYPICAL PEDON: Lepoil loam - on a nearly level, linear slope of 2 percent under coast redwood, red alder, swordfern, salal, redwood sorrel, cascara and red huckleberry at 17 meters (55 feet) elevation. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated. When described on August 28,2007 the soil was moist throughout).

TYPE LOCATION: Del Norte County, California; located approximately 12 kilometers north east of Crescent City, California; USGS Crescent City Quadrangle; WGS84 Decimal degrees 41.8603889 latitude and -124.1525833 longitude, UTM Zone 10 404336mE 4634918mN; NAD83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture: The soil is usually moist in all parts in the soil moisture control section in most years, but becomes nearly dry in the upper part from about September 15 to October 15 in most years. The soils have an udic soil moisture regime.

Soil temperature: The mean annual soil temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C (52 to 55 degrees F). The difference between mean summer and mean winter temperature is 2 to 4 degrees C. The soils have an isomesic temperature regime.

The umbric epipedon is 25 to 50 centimeters thick.

Organic matter: greater than 0.9 percent organic carbon in the upper 15 centimeters of the argillic horizon.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Littleriver and Sasquatch soils. Sasquatch soils are formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and siltstone. The Littleriver soil has 5 to 35 percent well rounded gravels in the particle size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lepoil soils are on gently sloping to steeply sloping dissected marine terraces and have slopes of 0 to 50 percent. Steep sloping terrace sides have had the riser component replaced by a hillslope component.  Elevations are 12 to 183 meters (40 to 600 feet). These soils formed in marine deposits derived from mixed sources. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, wet winters. A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  Mean annual precipitation is 890 to 2085 millimeters (35 to 90 inches). Mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C (50 to 53 degrees F). Frost free season is about 275 to 325 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Candymountain, Espa, and Timmons soils. Candymountian soils have greater than 15 percent particles with a diameter between 0.1 to 75 millimeters in the particle size control section. Espa soils are formed in weekly consolidated beach and dune deposits, and lack a clay increase of 20 percent or greater with in a vertical distance of 30 centimeters. Timmons soils occur under cultivated or cleared conditions where the difference between mean winter and mean summer soil temperature is 6 degrees C or greater.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; low to medium runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for timber production and urban development. Natural vegetation includes redwood with scattered Sitka spruce and red alder, salal, western swordfern, redwood sorrel, cascara and red huckleberry. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: California Coastal Redwood Belt; MLRA 4B. The series is not extensive.
