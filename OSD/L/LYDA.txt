LYDA SERIES

The Lyda series consists of very shallow and shallow over an indurated duripan, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium from mainly volcanic sources. Lyda soils are on fan remnants and fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Typic Argidurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lyda extremely gravelly fine sandy loam--rangeland (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

    A1--0 to 3 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely gravelly fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine interstitial pores; 70 percent rock fragments; violently effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); abrupt smooth boundary (3 to 8 cm thick)

    A2--3 to 10 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine vesicular pores; violently effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (3 to 10 cm thick)

    Bt--10 to 25 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse and medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, very friable, moderately sticky and very plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; common faint clay films in pores, many faint films bridging sand grains and few faint films on faces of peds; 35 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); clear wavy boundary.  (15 to 25 cm thick)

    Btk--25 to 30 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films in pores; 40 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles; violently effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (3 to 8 cm thick)

    Bqkm--30 to 100 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) indurated duripan, pale brown (10YR 6/3) massive; extremely hard, extremely firm; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0)

TYPE LOCATION:  Nye County, Nevada; about 3.75 miles southwest of the Peavine Ranch; 0.4 mile south and 0.4 mile east of the northwest corner of section 30, T. 8 N., R. 42 E.; USGS Peavine Ranch 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 31 minutes 36 seconds N and longitude 117 degrees 18 minutes 38 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.5266667 latitude, -117.3105556 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in some part for short periods during winter and early spring months and for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October due to convection storms; typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 15 degrees C.
Depth to duripan: 20 to 36 cm
Reaction: Strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 25 to 35 percent
Rock fragments - 35 to 50 percent total, mainly gravel

A & E horizons
Value 6 or 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Effervescence:  Noneffervescent through violently effervescent.

Bt horizon
Hue 7.5YR or 10YR.
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4.
Clay content:  30 to 40 percent.
Rock fragment:  35 to 50 percent.
Texture: Clay loam or sandy clay loam.
Structure: Subangular blocky or prismatic.
Consistence: Slightly hard or hard, very friable or friable, slightly plastic to very plastic.

Btk horizon
Value 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.

Chroma:  3 or 4.
Texture: Sandy clay loam or sandy loam
Rock fragments:  40 to 60 percent.
Consistence: Soft or slightly hard, very friable or friable.

Bqkm horizon
Value:  5 through 8 dry.
Chroma 2 through 4
Thickness:  Typically cemented for 60 to 120 cm, indurated at the upper part

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Maggie, Silverbow, Stingdorn, Tokoper and Tomel series.  

Maggie soils have bedrock at a depth of 50 to 100 cm.  Stingdorn and Tokoper soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 50 cm.  Silverbow soils are calcareous in the argillic horizon and have more than 50 percent rock fragments, mainly of stone and cobble size in the Bt horizon.  Tomel soils have 8 to 15 cm thick clay loam or sandy clay loam Bt1 horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lyda soils are on fan remnants and fan piedmonts.  Elevations are 1,482 to 2,110 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The soils formed in mixed alluvium derived from dominantly volcanic sources.  The mean annual precipitation is about 100 to 150 mm; the mean annual temperature is 11 to 14 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Spanel soils and the competing Maggie soils.  Spanel soils have a loamy particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The dominant vegetation is Bailey greasewood, shadscale, bud sagebrush, winterfat, kochia, galleta, Nevada ephedra, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Nevada. These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 29.
