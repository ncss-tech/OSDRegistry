LEHUNT SERIES

The Lehunt series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium or lacustrine deposits.  These soils occur on stream terraces and lakebeds.  These soils are subject to prolonged saturation from flood irrigation. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Oxyaquic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Lehunt fine sandy loam, in irrigated grass hay and pasture (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - stream terraces and lakebeds
Elevation - 5900 to 7,400 feet
Slope - 0 to 2 percent
Parent material - alluvium or lacustrine deposits
Climate - long, cold winters; cool, moist springs; short, cool summers
Mean annual precipitation - 14 to 19 inches
Mean annual air temperature - 34 to 39 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 30 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bighole, Shewag and Wisdom soils. Bighole soils are not salt and sodium effected and are on similar landforms.  Shewag soils are sandy-skeletal and are on outwash plains.  Wisdom soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and are on outwash plains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; moderately slow over very rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Lehunt soils are used for irrigated grass hay and irrigated pasture.  The vegetation is mainly basin wildrye, alkali cordgrass, alkali sacaton, western wheatgrass, inland saltgrass and greasewood.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Lehunt soils are not extensive in the intermountain valleys of southwestern Montana. MLRA - 44B.
