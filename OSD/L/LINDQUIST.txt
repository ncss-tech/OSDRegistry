LINDQUIST SERIES

The Lindquist series consist of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits on outwash plains, ground moraines, end moraines, stream terraces and kames. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, frigid Lamellic Haplorthods

TYPICAL PEDON: Lindquist sand, on a 1 percent slope in a forested area. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated) 

 Oe--0 to 2.5 cm (0 to 1 inch); dark brown (7.5YR3/2) partially decomposed forest litter; very strongly acid. [0 to 5 cm (0 to 2 inches) thick] 

 A--2.5 to 5 cm (1 to 2 inches); black (N 2.5/) sand, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; weak medium granular structure; very friable; many fine and medium and common coarse roots; about 1 percent fine gravel; very strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [3 to 10 cm (1 to 4 inches) thick] 

 E--5 to 13 cm (2 to 5 inches); brown (7.5YR 5/2) sand, light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; weak medium granular structure; very friable; common fine to coarse roots; about 1 percent fine gravel; very strongly acid; clear irregular boundary. [3 to 13 cm (1 to 5 inches) thick] 

 Bs1--13 to 33 cm (5 to 13 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) sand; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; common fine to coarse roots; about 1 percent fine gravel; strongly acid; clear irregular boundary. [10 to 25 cm (4 to 10 inches) thick] 

 Bs2--33 to 56 cm (13 to 22 inches); strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) sand; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; few fine, common medium, and few coarse roots; about 3 percent fine gravel; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. 

 Bs3--56 to 86 cm (22 to 34 inches); strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) sand; weak medium granular structure; very friable; few fine and medium roots; about 3 percent fine gravel; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bs2 and Bs3 horizon is 35 to 89 cm (14 to 35 inches).]

 E'--86 to 99 cm (34 to 39 inches); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sand, very pale brown (10YR 7/4) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; few medium roots; about 1 percent fine gravel; moderately acid; abrupt broken boundary. [8 to 38 cm (3 to 15 inches) thick] 

 E and Bt--99 to 196 cm (39 to 77 inches); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sand (E), very pale brown (10YR 7/4) dry; single grain; loose; strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) loamy sand lamellae (Bt); weak fine granular structure; very friable; clay bridging between sand grains; lamellae are 3 to 12 mm (1/8 to 1/2 inches) thick; total accumulation of lamellae is less than 15 cm (6 inches); few fine roots; about 1 percent fine gravel; slightly acid; abrupt broken boundary. [64 to 132 cm (25 to 52 inches) thick] 

 C--196 to 203 cm (77 to 80 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) sand; single grain; loose; about 3 percent fine gravel; neutral.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Blue Lake, Islandlake and McMillan series. Blue Lake soils have an accumulation of lamellae within a depth of 203 cm (80 inches) of more than 15 cm (6 inches). Islandlake soils have a Bhs horizon. McMillan soils have more than 30 percent silt in the upper part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lindquist soils are on outwash plains, ground moraines, end moraines, stream terraces, and kames. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. The Lindquist soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 813 mm (30 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 to 7.2 degrees C (43 to 45 degrees F). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the excessively drained Rubicon and Grayling soils on similar landscape positions. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat excessively drained. The potential surface runoff is negligible or low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of these soils are forested, including tree plantations. Some areas are idle or are in pasture. Only a very small proportion is used for small grains and hay crops. Forest vegetation consists chiefly of red maple, red pine, aspen, white oak, american beech, eastern white pine, and jack pine. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 94A and 96 in the northern Lower Peninsula of Michigan and MLRA 90A in northwestern Wisconsin. This series is of moderate extent.
