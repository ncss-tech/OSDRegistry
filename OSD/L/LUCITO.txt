The soil moisture regime is typic ustic.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. A similar soil in another family is the Rionutria series. Rionutria soils are moderately deep and have mollic epipedons that are not pachic

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lucito soils are on toeslopes and footslopes of mountains, and on summits of plateaus. They formed in slope alluvium derived from latite and dacite of the Tertiary age Tschicoma Formation. Slopes are 1 to 8 percent. Elevation ranges from 8,800 to 9,500 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 24 to 28 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 41 to 43 degrees F. The frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Estaban and Mapache soils.  Estaban soils are fragmental, have a cambic horizon, and occur on backslopes of canyons.  Mapache soils are loamy-skeletal, do not have an argillic horizon, and occur on backslopes and footslopes of mountains. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium surface runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Lucito soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat.  Present vegetation is quaking aspen, white fir, Douglas fir, Parry's oatgrass, nodding brome, Thurber's fescue, bottlebrush squirreltail, American vetch, bluebell bellflower, and nodding onion.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Lucito soils are of small extent on the Jemez Volcanic Field part of the Southern Rocky Mountains province in northcentral New Mexico.  The MLRA is 48A. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES PROPOSED: Sandoval County, New Mexico; Bandelier National Monument Soil Survey; 2000. Lucito is a place name.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon- The zone from 1 to 22 inches. (A1, A2, and A3 horizons)

Glossic horizon - The zone from 22 to 37 inches (E/B1 and E/B2 horizons)

Argillic horizon - The zone from 37 to 82 inches. (Bt horizon)

Particle-size control section - The zone from 37 to 57 inches (upper part of the Bt horizon)

This soil may have a udic ustic moisture regime subclass rather than typic ustic. Further study is needed.
