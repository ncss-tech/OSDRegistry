LIPKE SERIES

The Lipke series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum or alluvium derived from mudstone or shale. These soils are on uplands. Slopes range from 15 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Vertic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Lipke clay loam, in forestland (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 Oi--0 to 2 inches; pinecones, needles, twigs, and humus; abrupt smooth boundary. (0.5 to 3 inches thick)

 A1--2 to 3 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate very fine and fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky, very plastic; many very fine and fine roots; moderately acid (pH 5.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (1 to 4 inches thick)

 A2--3 to 6 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine and medium granular structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; common medium and coarse and many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine pores; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 7 inches thick)

 BA--6 to 14 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) heavy clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; common medium and coarse and many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine pores; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 9 inches thick)

 Bw1--14 to 22 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clay, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate very fine and fine angular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; common very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine and fine pores; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 9 inches thick)

 Bw2--22 to 27 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong fine angular blocky structure with few slickensides; extremely hard, firm, moderately sticky, very plastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine and fine pores; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 15 inches thick)

 BC--27 to 44 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, very firm, moderately sticky, very plastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine and fine pores; neutral (pH 6.8); diffuse wavy boundary. (8 to 20 inches thick)

 Ck--44 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) and gray (5Y 6/1) clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) and gray (5Y 5/1) moist; massive; extremely hard, extremely firm, moderately sticky, very plastic; few very fine roots; few fine and common very fine pores; 5 percent flat angular gravel; common fine soft masses of lime; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).

COMPETING SERIES:

Dapoin (CO) is driest in May and June; is wettest in July and August.
Frazer (MT+WY) does not have a horizon of secondary carbonate accumulation.
Moreau (ND+MT SD) is moderately deep to a paralithic contact.
Narraguinnep (CO+WY) has a pachic epipedon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform: Shale uplands
Elevation: 4,200 to 6,100 feet
Slope: 15 to 60 percent
Parent material: Residuum derived from mudstone or shale or in alluvium over mudstone or shale
Climate: Cool
Mean annual precipitation: 19 to 24 inches
Mean annual air temperature: 40 to 43 degrees F
Frost-free period: 80 to 110 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:

Alder (MT) is in grassland; has an argillic horizon.
Tigeron (MT) is loamy-skeletal; weathered from sandstone.
Tomty (MT) has somewhat poorly drained clayey soils.
Wayden (ND+MT SD WY) is shallow over shale.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; very slow permeability

USE AND VEGETATION: Lipke soils are used mainly for forest products and, to a lesser extent, range. The potential native vegetation is mainly ponderosa pine with an understory of common snowberry, Oregongrape, white spiraea, Saskatoon serviceberry, heartleaf arnica, and blue wildrye.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Lipke soils are not extensive in central Montana; MLRA 46.
