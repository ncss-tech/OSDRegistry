LEWISPOINT SERIES

The Lewispoint series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy alluvium on flood plains. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 620 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 0.6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, isotic Fluventic Dystrocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Lewispoint silt, located on a flood plain with a slope of 1 percent and elevation of 14 meters; when described on September 16th, 2008 the soil was moist throughout (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted)

 A--0 to 8 cm; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) silt; 5 percent sand; 90 percent silt; 5 percent clay; weak fine granular structure; friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; many fine roots, common medium roots, few coarse roots, and many very fine roots; strongly acid (pH 5.1); clear smooth boundary

 Bw--8 to 110 cm; very fine sandy loam; 40 percent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4), 40 percent brown (10YR 5/3), 10 percent olive brown (2.5Y 4/3), and 5 percent black (10YR 2/1) very fine sandy loam; 60 percent sand; 33 percent silt; 7 percent clay; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common fine roots, few medium roots, few coarse roots, and common very fine roots; 5 percent coarse strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) masses of oxidized iron with diffuse boundaries; strongly acid (pH 5.5); clear wavy boundary

 BC--110 to 130 cm; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) fine sandy loam; 65 percent sand; 32 percent silt; 3 percent clay; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; few fine roots, few medium roots, few coarse roots, and few very fine roots; 2 percent nonflat 2 to 75 millimeter fragments; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear wavy boundary

 C--130 to 183 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loamy sand; 80 percent sand; 18 percent silt; 2 percent clay; single grain; loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; few fine roots, few medium roots, few coarse roots, and few very fine roots; moderately acid (pH 5.8)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material - Coarse-loamy alluvium
Landform - Flood plains
Slope - 0 to 4 percent
Elevation - 7 to 62 meters
Climate - Cool summers; cold winters, August and September are the wettest months
Mean annual precipitation - 608 to 648 mm
Mean annual air temperature - 0.5 to 0.7 degrees C
Frost free duration - 85 to 140 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
Keefer - Moderately well drained; loamy alluvium; similar landform position
Kokwok - Well drained; loamy, sandy and gravelly alluvium; similar landform position
Nunachuak - Very poorly drained; silty and loamy alluvium, low flood plains
Halfmoon - Very poorly drained; organic parent material; low flood plains
Ekwok - Well drained, loamy eolian deposits, plains
Tunravik - Well drained, eolain and alluvium, terraces

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: (Ksat)
Drainage class - Moderately well drained
Saturation in normal years - Occurs in a layer from 75 to 152 cm of the soil surface for more than two weeks during the growing season; the water table may come up higher in the profile for a period of less than two weeks. Redoximorphic features in the upper part of the Bw are the product of spring thaw where water perches on top of hard frost.
Flooding - Occasional and brief
Ponding - Rare
Ksat - Moderately high to high throughout the profile

USE AND VEGETATION:  
Use - Wildlife habitat and hunting
Potential natural vegetation - Western maritime scrubland composed of Alder, willow, western touch-me-not, and horsetails

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Bristol Bay Lowlands; MLRA 236; small extent
