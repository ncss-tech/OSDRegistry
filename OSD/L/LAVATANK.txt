LAVATANK SERIES

The Lavatank series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits in the upper part of residuum weathered from aa lava or cinders derived from volcanic rock. The Lavatank soils are on cinder cones and "aa" lava flows. Slopes range from 8 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 138 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal over cindery, mixed, superactive, calcareous, thermic Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Lavatank very gravelly sandy loam, on a south facing, 60 percent slope under rangeland at an elevation of 1009 meters. (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted. 5/23/2019 actual site observation date.) The soil surface is covered by approximately 5 percent fine gravel, 75 percent medium and coarse gravel, 15 percent cobbles, 1 percent stones.

(5 to 13 cm thick)

     Bt--5 to 12 cm (2 to 5 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4), moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine irregular and common very fine irregular pores; 5 percent prominent brown (7.5YR 5/4), dry, clay films on rock fragments and 20 percent prominent brown (7.5YR 5/4), dry, clay films on all faces of peds; 5 percent fine gravel, 30 percent medium and coarse gravel, 3 percent cobbles, 1 percent stones; very slight effervescence; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (0 to7 cm thick)

     Bk--12 to 62 cm (5 to 24 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4), moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common fine irregular and common very fine irregular pores; 60 percent prominent pale orange yellow (10YR 9/2), dry, carbonate coats on bottom surfaces of rock fragments; 1 percent fine faint spherical noncoherent cemented pale orange yellow (10YR 9/2), dry, carbonate masses with sharp boundaries on bottom of rock fragments; 10 percent fine gravel, 45 percent medium and coarse gravel, 10 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; violent effervescence; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); gradual wavy boundary. (25 to 60 cm thick)

     Ck--62 to 120 cm (24 to 47 inches); very dark gray (10YR 3/1) gravel, black (10YR 2/1), moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common medium interstitial and common coarse interstitial pores; 60 percent prominent pale orange yellow (10YR 9/2), dry, carbonate coats on bottom surfaces of rock fragments; 1 percent fine faint spherical noncoherent cemented pale orange yellow (10YR 9/2), dry, carbonate masses with sharp boundaries on bottom of rock fragments; 15 percent fine gravel, 60 percent medium and coarse gravel, 10 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); Less than 10 percent black very coarse sand in voids.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Lavatank soils are on cinder cones and "aa" lava flows. Slopes range from 8 to 75 percent. The soils formed in eolian deposits in the upper part of residuum weathered from aa lava or cinders derived from volcanic rock. Elevation ranges from 770 to 1400 meters. The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm. The mean annual air temperature is about 16 to 20 degrees C. The frost-free period is 270 to 320 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Railroad series. Railroad soils are moderately deep to bedrock and have a calcic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: well drained; high runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Lavatank soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is creosote bush and Fremont dalea. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Basin and Range of California, U.S.A.; MLRA 30. The series is of small extent.
