LAMESILLA SERIES

The Lamesilla series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist.  Lamesilla soils are on inset fans of eroded fan remnants.  Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Crucitas, Haozous, Janude, Kaskan, Paymaster, and Payter series.
Crucitas soils do not have AC horizons indicative of recent depositional events.
Haozous soils do not have cambic horizons and have an aridic moisture regime.
Janude and Kaskan soils have hues of 10YR or yellower and an ustic moisture regime bordering on udic.
Paymaster soils have less than 15 percent gravel in the particle-size control section.
Payter soils have developed in sandstone parent materials, have fewer than 10 percent gravels, and have carbonates to the surface.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lamesilla soils are on inset fans of eroded fan remnants.  They formed in slope alluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist.  Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,500 to 7,300 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Horcado, Latierra, Levante, and Nazario soils.  Horcado soils are sandy-skeletal, have thin mollic epipedons and calcic horizons, and occur on backslopes of erosional fan remnants.  Latierra soils are coarse-loamy, have thin mollic epipedons and argillic horizons, and occur on toeslopes of erosional fan remnants.  Levante soils are sandy, do not have diagnostic horizons, and occur on narrow flood plains of valley floors.  Nazario soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, have ochric epipedons and calcic horizons, and occur on narrow beveled summits and shoulders of erosional fan remnants.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; low surface runoff; permeability is moderately rapid.  Lamesilla soils are subject to frequent, extremely brief periods of flooding between July and September.  Floodwaters have low velocity and are generally less than 1 foot deep.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Lamesilla soils are used for urban development, livestock grazing, and recreation.  The historic climax vegetation is blue grama, black grama, oak, galleta, oneseed juniper.  The ecological site is Hills(R036XB124NM).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Lamesilla soils are of small extent on the southeastern Espanola Basin part of the Basin and Range province in northcentral New Mexico.  The MLRA is 36.
