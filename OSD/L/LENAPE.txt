Thickness of the organic deposits: 41 to 130 cm (16 to 51 inches)
Electrical Conductivity (saturation extract): < than 4 mmhos/cm throughout the profile.

n-Value: Mineral soil horizons typically have n-value greater than 0.7, but range to less than 0.7.

Range of Individual Horizons:
Surface tier (Oe and Oa horizons):
Color--hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3
Texture-- It is hemic and sapric soil materials. The fiber content after rubbing is greater than one-sixth of the soil volume, and less than three quarters. 
Mineral content (by weight): 20 to 60 percent.

Subsurface tier (Oe and Oa horizons):
Color--hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4, or is neutral
Texture--It is typically sapric material but ranges from hemic to sapric. The fiber content after rubbing ranges from one-tenth through one-third of the soil volume. 
Mineral content (by weight): 25 to 75 percent

Cg horizon:

REMARKS:
Lenape soils were previously mapped as swamp, and tidal marsh, fresh, miscellaneous areas.
Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Hemic soil materials--the zone from 0 to 20 centimeters (0 to 8 inches (Oe1, Oe2 horizons))
Sapric soil material--the zone from 20 to 66 centimeters (8 to 26 inches (Oa horizon))
Aquic conditions--the zone from 0 to 183 centimeters (0 to 72 inches)
Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Lithologic discontinuity-the zone at 152 centimeters (60 inches)

The following changes have been made (12/2012):
1)	Revisions to formatting and data consistency with NASIS.
2)	Revisions made to include NASIS information and laboratory data
3)	The location was revised from latitude 38 degrees 42 minutes 17.27 seconds N. and 75 degrees 33 minutes 34.36 seconds W. to latitude 38 degrees 42 minutes 17.27 seconds N. and 75 degrees 33 minutes 30.0 seconds W. place the pedon in the proper mapunit
