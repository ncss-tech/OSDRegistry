LOGGERHEAD SERIES

The Loggerhead series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loamy till on ground moraines.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum, moderately slow in the lower part and slow or very slow in the substratum.  Slope ranges from 1 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.

UTM, Zone 16N, 289347 meters east, 5187396 meters north, NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the upper part of the solum and depth to the top of the argillic horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 30 to more than 80 inches.  Depth to the densic contact is at 60 inches or greater.  The solum is moderately acid to extremely acid.  Depth to carbonates is greater than 40 inches.  Gravel content ranges from 1 to 30 percent and cobble and stone content ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the solum. Gravel content ranges from 1 to 35 percent and cobble and stone content ranges from 0 to 25 in the substratum.  Stone cover ranges from less than .01 to .1 percent of the surface.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Annalake, Goodwit, Mashek, Newood, Padwood, Peavy, Reade, Sarwet, Shoepac, and Tipler series. Annalake soils are stratified.  Goodwit soils have a 12 to 40 inch silty mantle and do not have carbonates. Mashek, Newood, and Peavy soil have more sand in the lower part of the profile.   Padwood and Tipler soils have stratified sandy outwash and do not have carbonates.  Reade soils are underlain by bedrock.  Sarwet soils have more coarse fragments and do not have carbonates.  Shoepac soils have 18 to 30 percent clay in the argillic horizon and have layers exhibiting fragic properties.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Loggerhead soils are on knolls, rises and sideslopes on ground moraines.  Slope ranges from 1 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 31 to 34 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 44 degrees F. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Annalake, Belding, Big Iron, Flintsteel, and Watton soils. Annalake soils are on adjacent areas of stratified sediments.  Belding soils are in the same drainage sequence with Loggerhead.  Big Iron, Flintsteel, and Watton soils are fine-loamy.  Moderately well drained Annalake and Flintsteel soils are on similar landscape positions.  Somewhat poorly drained Belding and Big Iron soils are on slightly lower landscape positions.  Well drained Watton soils are on steeper sideslopes and ridges.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Surface runoff is low to high depending on the slope.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum, moderately slow in the lower part and slow or very slow in the substratum.  These soils have a perched seasonal water table from 1 to 3.5 feet below the surface from November to May.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are forested.  The major species are sugar maple, red maple, green ash, quaking aspen, bigtooth aspen, eastern hemlock, basswood, yellow birch, and balsam fir. Some areas are used for pasture and hay production or are idle.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Upper Peninsula of Michigan, MLRA 92.  This series is of moderate extent.
