LANAPOHAKU SERIES

The Lanapohaku series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and `a`a lava. Slopes range from 6 to 50 percent. The mean annual rainfall is about 500 millimeters (20 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (53 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Huikau series.  Huikau soils have cinders in the particle size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lanapohaku soils are on high elevation slopes of Mauna Kea volcano at elevations from 2,012 to 3,048 meters (6,600 to 10,000 feet). These soils are on `a`a lava flows that have been covered by sandy volcanic ash. Underlying lava flows are 5,000 to 250,000 years old. Slope gradients range from 6 to 50 percent. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 400 to 1000 millimeters (16 to 40 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1,520 to 1,780 millimeters (60 to 70 inches). The mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 14 degrees C (45 to 57 degrees F). The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Lapa and Pohakulehu soils. Lapa soils are less than 50 centimeters to bedrock and Pohakulehu soils contain greater than 35 percent rock fragments throughout the upper meter of soil. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained. Runoff is low to moderate. Permeability is rapid. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat. Natural vegetation is Mamane (Sophora chrysophylla), Pukiawe (Styphelia tameiameiae), Pilo (Coprosma spp.), lovegrass (Eragrostis spp.), Aalii (Dodonaea viscosa), common velvetgrass (Holcus lanatus), fireweed (Senecio madagascariensis), and orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.). 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Hamakua district, Island of Hawaii; MLRA 160. The soils are of small extent.
