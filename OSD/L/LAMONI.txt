LAMONI SERIES

The Lamoni series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in 25 to 50 centimeters of loess or a mixture of loess and pedisediment and the underlying paleosol formed in till.  These soils are on side slopes on dissected till plains.  Slope ranges from 5 to 18 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 850 millimeters.

Series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.
Mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 46 centimeters (Ap, A and BA horizons).

Aquic moisture regime.

Generally, Lamoni, Clarinda and Shelby soils are not on the same slope. Where the loess is thin, the Clarinda soils are on secondary interfluves or at the shoulder of side slopes and the Lamoni soils are on side slopes.  Where slopes are long, both Lamoni and Shelby soils are commonly on the same side slope.  On steep slopes, Lamoni soils are usually on the interfluves or shoulders of slopes and the Shelby soils are on the entire side slope.
