MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Lee County, South Carolina, 2005.

REMARKS: Lucknow series soils were previously mapped as Blanton soils. Blanton soils do not have a kandic horizon.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 42 inches (Ap and E horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 42 to 80 inches (Bt horizons)
Aquic conditions--periodic saturation and reduction in a zone starting at a depth between 40 to 72 inches to a depth of 80 inches at some time during the year (endosaturation)
Kandic horizon--the zone from 42 to 80 inches (Bt horizons)
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 80 inches

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Reference samples were analyzed and are available from the Clemson University, pedon numbers: S97SC-061-035, S97SC-061-036; S98SC-061-046; and S00SC-061-072).
