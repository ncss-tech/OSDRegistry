LEDUMHILL SERIES

The Ledumhill series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in organic material over alluvium, slope alluvium, and till derived from granitic rocks. The Ledumhill soils are on seeps on glacial valley floors, mountain slopes, and basins of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 985 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Ledumhill soils are on seeps on glacial valley floors, broadly concave mountain slopes, and basins. Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent. These soils formed in organic material over alluvium, slope alluvium, and till derived from granitic rocks. Elevation is 2570 to 3615 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 620 to 1400 mm and the mean annual air temperature is -1 to 5 degrees C. The frost free season is 50 to 95 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the McGee and Siberian soils. The McGee soils are on ground moraines on glacial valley and basin floors, are moderately well drained, are loamy-skeletal, and have a densic layer below 50 cm. Siberian soils are on ground moraines on glacial valley floors, are well drained, and have a densic contact below 100 cm.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained, high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity. Occasional to frequent flooding and ponding for brief (2 to 7 days) duration from May to July. Seasonal high water table at 10 to 40 cm.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Vegetation is Labrador tea, shootingstar, Carex species, bog blueberry, Lemmon's willow, purple mountainheath, and Sierra lodgepole pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. These soils are of limited extent.
