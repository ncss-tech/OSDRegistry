LOGHOUSE SERIES

The Loghouse series consists of deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils.  The soil formed from ancient gravelly and stony materials washed from areas of igneous rocks.  The soil occurs on nearly level to moderately steep uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Loghouse very gravelly loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

       Oi--0 to 2 inches, mat of oak, pine, and juniper leaves and stems.  (0 to 6 inches thick)

       A--2 to 8 inches, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; strong fine granular structure; soft, very friable; many fine and medium roots; 40 percent by volume of volcanic fragments of 25 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  ( 4 to 9 inches thick)

       E--8 to 16 inches, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very gravelly sandy loam; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; many fine and medium roots; 45 percent by volume of volcanic fragments of 30 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 24 inches thick)

       Bt1--16 to 32 inches, brown (7.5YR 5/2) extremely  gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; common fine roots and pores; clay bridging between sand grains; thin patchy clay films on fragments; 65 percent by volume of volcanic fragments of 45 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (8 to 24 inches thick)

       Bt2--32 to 72 inches, reddish brown (5YR 5/3) extremely  gravelly sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm; few fine roots and pores; clay bridging between sand grains; thin patchy clay film on fragments; 70 percent by volume of volcanic fragments of 50 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; moderately acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Jeff Davis County, Texas; in Limpia Canyon at a point that is 6-1/2 miles north of Bloyd Camp grounds.

Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: sandy loam or loam
Reaction: slightly acid or medium acid
Coarse fragments: 22 to 50 percent by volume and comprise 15 to 45 percent gravel, 5 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 20 percent stones

Bt horizon
Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR or 5YR
Value: 5
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: sandy loam or sandy clay loam
Clay content: 12 to 35 percent 
Reaction: medium acid or strongly acid
Coarse fragments: 40 to 85 percent by volume and comprise 20 to 80 percent gravel, 5 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 20 percent stones.  In most pedons, percentage of coarse fragments increases with increasing depth

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Mathias (SD) series. Mathias soils are slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline, formed in colluvial sediments weathered from interbedded sandstone and shale in the Black Hills Footslopes (LRR-G MLRA 61).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Loghouse soils are on fans and terraces of narrow mountain valleys in deep canyons at the higher elevations, usually above 6,000 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  These soils formed in gravelly and stony outwash of igneous material.  The deposits are from 60 inches to 10 feet or more thick.  Annual rainfall is from 22 to 26 inches.  The mean air temperature is about 55 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Madrone series, and the Puerta series.  Puerta soils have a mollic epipedon, a clayey-skeletal Bt horizon, and are less than 40 inches to volcanic bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Use is mainly as native range.  Vegetation is forest or tree cover of ponderosa pine, pinion pine, gray oak, one-seed juniper, and Texas Madrone with some grasses such as pinion, ricegrass, pine muhly, deer grass, and Texas bluestem.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  At the higher elevation of the Davis Mountains in West Texas.  The series is of minor extent (probably about 5,000 acres). MLRA 42.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Jeff Davis County, Texas; 1971.

REMARKS:  These soils were formerly classified in the Gray Wooded great soil group.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  Ochric epipedon - 0 to 14 inches, Albic horizon - 6 to 14 inches, Argillic horizon - 14 to 70 inches.
