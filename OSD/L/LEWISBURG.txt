LEWISBURG SERIES

The Lewisburg series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are shallow to dense till. These soils formed in till on till plains and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (53 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, mixed, active, mesic, shallow Aquic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Lewisburg silt loam, on a convex, 3 percent slope in a cultivated field at an elevation of about 351 meters (1150 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Cd2--76 to 203 cm (30 to 80 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam; massive; very firm; common fine distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions along fracture faces; common fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation along fracture faces; few light gray (10YR 7/2) calcium carbonate coatings on vertical fracture faces 10 cm (4 inches) apart; 12 percent rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Soils in similar families include the Branchville, Cardinal, Celina, Loudon, and Tarlton series. These soils do not have a densic contact within a depth of 51 cm (20 inches). In addition, Branchville, Cardinal, Celina, and Loudon soils have sola greater than 51 cm (20 inches) thick. Tarlton soils have bedrock within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Lewisburg soils are on till plains and moraines of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent. The soils formed in till. Climate is humid and temperate. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 838 to 1016 mm (33 to 40 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 11 to 13 degrees C (51 to 55 degrees) F. Frost-free period is 145 to 190 days. Elevation is (900 to 1250 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brookston, Celina, Crosby, Kokomo, Miamian, and Pyrmont soils. The poorly drained Brookston and very poorly drained Kokomo soils have mollic epipedons and are in depressions or on nearly level areas. Celina soils have thicker sola but are on similar landscape positions. The somewhat poorly drained Crosby soils have thicker sola and are on nearly level areas or on gentle slopes. The well drained Miamian soils have thicker sola and are on similar landscape positions. The somewhat poorly drained Pyrmont soils are on lower topographic positions or on more gentle slopes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 15 to 61 cm (0.5 to 2 feet) between January and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and moderately low in the substratum. Permeability is moderate or moderately slow in the solum and slow in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cropped. Corn, soybeans, and wheat are the principal crops. A few areas are in permanent pasture or woodland. Native vegetation is mixed, deciduous hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central and west central Ohio and possibly east central Indiana; MLRA 111A. The series is of moderate extent.

REMARKS: In several subsets, Lewisburg soils are mapped in complexes with Miamian or Crosby soils.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 23 cm (Ap horizon).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 23 to 36 cm (Bt horizon).
