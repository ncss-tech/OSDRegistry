LINTIM SERIES

The Lintim series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from shale.  Lintim soils are on mountains, hills, and structural benches.  Slopes range from 3 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic Pachic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Lintim loam, on a south facing 13 percent convex slope in rangeland at an elevation of 8,100 feet. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) When described on July 18, 1984 the soil was dry throughout.

    A1--0 to 5 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine and very fine roots; few fine tubular pores; 3 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.

    A2--5 to 20 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine roots; few fine tubular pores; 3 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.  (The combined thickness of the A horizon is 16 to 25 inches)

    Bt1--20 to 30 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine roots; few fine tubular pores; many continuous distinct clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual smooth boundary.

    Bt2--30 to 40 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine roots; few fine tubular pores; common discontinuous distinct clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual smooth boundary. (The combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 20 to 50 inches)

    BC--40 to 65 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; few fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0).
