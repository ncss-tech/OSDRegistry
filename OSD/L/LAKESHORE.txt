LAKESHORE SERIES

The Lakeshore series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Lakeshore soils are on lake plains and lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Aquisalids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lakeshore silt loam--rangeland. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface has a 3 millimeter thick salt crust.

TYPE LOCATION:  Weber County, Utah; about 3 miles west of West Warren Church; approximately 1,320 feet east and 1,000 feet north of the southwest corner of section 17, T. 6 N., R. 3 W.; USGS Plain City SW 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; 41 degrees 15 minutes 11 seconds north latitude and 112 degrees 12 minutes 49 seconds west longitude, NAD83; UTM zone 12N 398330E, 4567557N, NAD83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil moisture - The soils are saturated with water during most of the year within a depth of 40 inches; the upper part of the moisture control section is dry during summer months in normal years; Aquic moisture regime during seasonal periods of saturation and reduction.

Mean annual soil temperature - 50 to 54 degrees F.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 8 to 18 percent.

Salinity - Surface is typically crusted with a thin layer of salt (mostly sodium chloride); salic horizon begins at the soil surface.


Az horizon - Hue: 2.5Y or 5Y.
Value: 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry.
Chroma: 1 or 2, dry or moist.
Texture: Silt loam or fine sandy loam.
Salinity (EC): 32 to 90 mmhos/cm.
Sodicity (SAR): 13 to 90.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 5 to 25 percent.
Reaction: Slightly alkaline through strongly alkaline.


Czg horizons - Hue: 2.5Y or 5Y.
Value: 4 through 6 moist.
Chroma: 1 through 3, dry or moist.
Texture: Loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.
Salinity (EC): 32 to 90 mmhos/cm.
Sodicity (SAR): 13 to 90.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 5 to 25 percent.
Reaction: Neutral through strongly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lakeshore soils are on lake plains and lake terraces adjoining small ponds.  These soils formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks such as limestone, quartzite, shale, and sandstone.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  Elevations range from 4,200 to 4,400 feet.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is 66 to 71 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 160 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Leland, Saltair, and Warm Springs soils.  Leland soils are fine-loamy, have natric horizons, have seasonal high water tables at 30 to 48 inches in depth, and occur under alkali sacaton and black greasewood.  Saltair soils are fine-silty.  Warm Springs soils are fine-loamy, have mollic epipedons and calcic horizons, and occur under alkali sacaton.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; negligible surface runoff; slow permeability (moderately low or moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity).  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between the soil surface and 1.7 feet (very shallow and shallow free water occurrence classes) year-round.  Cumulative annual duration class is Persistent.  These soils are susceptible to occasional ponding for brief duration from March through July with water up to 6 inches deep.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Lakeshore soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The soil surface is about 90 percent bare ground with some scattered vegetation that is usually inland saltgrass and pickleweed.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Utah.  These soils are not extensive with about 9,400 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 28A.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Phoenix, Arizona.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Weber County (Davis-Weber Area), Utah, 1967.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 4 inches (Az horizon).

Salic horizon - The zone from the soil surface to 64 inches (Az, Czg1, Czg2, Czg3, Czg4, and Czg5 horizons).

Aquic conditions - The conditions of endosaturation, reduction, and redoximorphic features between the soil surface and 20 inches at certain times during normal years (parts of the Az, Czg1, Czg2, Czg3, and Czg4 horizons).

Particle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (Czg3 horizon and parts of the Czg2 and Czg4 horizons).


The soil was last reviewed in the field in 1965.  It needs to be determined if the soil moisture control section is dry in some or all parts at some time during normal years.  The height and duration of the seasonal high water needs to be verified in the field.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has partial characterization data by the Soils Laboratory from Utah State University (USU) Logan, UT and is published on pages 140-141, Table 11 of the Soil Survey of Davis-Weber Area, Utah.  The pH values in the typical pedon are from saturated paste.
