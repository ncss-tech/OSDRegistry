GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: La Hogue soils are on stream terraces and outwash plains. They formed in loamy and sandy outwash material of mixed mineralogy of Wisconsinan Age. Some pedons have a thin mantle of loess or other silty material on the surface. Slopes commonly are 1 to 2 percent but range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 11 degrees C (48 to 52 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 910 to 1035 mm (36 to 41 inches), frost-free period ranges from 160 to 175 days, and elevation ranges from 160 to 240 meters (525 to 787 feet) above mean sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brenton, Drummer, Jasper, Lomax, Onarga, Proctor, Ridgeville, and Selma soils. Brenton, Drummer, and Proctor soils contain more silt and less sand in the particle-size control section and are on nearby landscapes that contain a mantle of loess or silty material more than  51 cm (20 inches) thick. Jasper, Lomax, and Onarga soils generally are upslope and are better drained and lack chroma of 2 in the upper part of the B horizon. Ridgeville soils are on similar nearby landscapes and contain less clay. Selma soils are on nearby lower-lying landscapes, are poorly drained, and have low chroma and more yellow hue throughout the B horizon. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. An apparent seasonal high water table is at a depth of 30 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) at some time between January and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is low or medium. Permeability is moderate. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/second). 

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used to grow corn, soybeans, small grain, and meadow. Native vegetation is prairie grass. 
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Illinois, Wisconsin, and Iowa. Extent is moderate. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana. 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Iroquois County, Illinois, 1939. 

REMARKS: Some pedons have loam till below the stratified outwash and a till substratum phase is recognized. The lab data only provides particle size analysis and shows the argillic does not extend to 109 cm. The OSD site needs to be resampled with full characterization data obtained. This soil will be evaluated during MLRA updating to determine if new series needed. 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 41 cm (Ap and A horizons). 
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 41 to 66 cm (Bt1 horizon). 
Aquic conditions: redox features in all horizons below a depth of 41 cm.
