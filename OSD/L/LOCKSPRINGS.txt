LOCKSPRINGS SERIES

The Locksprings series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in residuum from limestone and interbedded shale. Permeability is slow. These soils are on upland sideslopes and have slopes of 9 to 35 percent. Mean annual temperature is 54 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 39 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Oxyaquic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Locksprings silty clay loam - on an 11 percent slope in woodland at an elevation of 920 feet.

   A--0 to 7 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; moderate fine granular structure; friable; common very fine and fine roots; 10 percent flagstones of limestone; neutral; abrupt irregular boundary.  (6 to 10 inches thick)

   Bt1--7 to 15 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) very bouldery clay; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; firm; common very fine and fine roots; common faint clay films on faces of peds and in pores and few organic coats; 35 percent flat boulders and 15 percent stones of limestone; neutral; clear irregular boundary.

   Bt2--15 to 28 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) very bouldery clay; weak fine subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and in pores; few organic coats; common fine distinct olive (5Y 4/4) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) masses of iron accumulation; few fine black soft masses of iron and manganese accumulation; 45 percent flat boulders and 5 percent stones of limestone; slightly acid; abrupt irregular boundary.

   R--28 inches; limestone.

TYPE LOCATION:  Livingston County, Missouri; about 13 miles north and west of Chillicothe; 2550 feet west and 2850 feet north of the southeast corner of sec. 10, T. 59 N., R. 25 W.; Shearwood quadrangle, lat. 39 degrees 56 minutes 20 seconds N. and long. 93 degrees 41 minutes 46 seconds W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 1 to 3. It is silty clay loam, silt loam and silty clay. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral. Some pedons have an E horizon.

The Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 8. It is commonly mottled with hue of 10YR to 5Y. It is very stony or very bouldery analogues of clay. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Locksprings soils are on upland sideslopes and formed in residuum from limestone and interbedded shale. Slopes range from 9 to 35 percent. The mean annual temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Gorin, Keswick, Gosport and Vanmeter series. Gorin and Keswick soils are very deep and are higher on the landscape. Gosport and Vanmeter soils do not have argillic horizons and are on similar positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained. Permeability is slow. Runoff is medium or rapid. In undisturbed areas, a perched water table has an upper limit of 1.5 to 3.0 feet during November to April in most years.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used for woodland. A few areas are used for pasture. Native vegetation is upland hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwest Missouri (MLRA 109). The series is of moderate extent.
