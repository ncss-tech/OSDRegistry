LYMANSON SERIES

The Lymanson series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to soft sandstone interbedded with loamstone and thin, discontinuous strata of hard sandstone or siltstone.  The soils formed in residuum modified by soil creep, slope alluvium, and colluvial action.  Lymanson soils are on mountain and ridge shoulders, scarp slopes, backslopes, and summits.  Slopes range from 4 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Ustic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lymanson loam-rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform: mountain and ridge summits, scarp slopes, shoulders, and backslope and footslope positions.  
Parent material: formed in calcareous, medium, or moderately fine textured material weathered from sedimentary rock.  Colluvial slopewash, soil creep, and other colluvial processes have influenced soil properties and contributed coarse fragments unlike the sedimentary beds.  
Slope: 4 to 40 percent.  
Elevation: 5,400 to 9,500 feet.  
Mean annual precipitation: 15 to 21 inches.
Mean annual temperature: 33 to 42 degrees F.  
Frost-free season: variable and is estimated to range from 30 to 90 days depending upon elevation, aspect, and air drainage.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Jenkinson, Mosroc, and Turk soils and the competing Gelkie soils.  Jenkinson and Mosroc soils have a lithic contact at less than 20 inches.  Also, Jenkinson soils do not have an argillic horizon and Mosroc soils are skeletal throughout.  Turk soils have more than 60 percent clay in the control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow or medium runoff depending upon slope; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is western wheatgrass, spike fescue, Idaho fescue, and big sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mountainous areas of western and north-central Wyoming, south-central Montana, and northern Colorado.  The series is of moderate extent.  MLRAs 43B and 48A.
