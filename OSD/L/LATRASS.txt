LATRASS SERIES

The Latrass series consists of deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that are reconstructed from clayey materials over landfills. These nearly level to steep soils are mainly on uplands. Slope range is 1 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 928 mm (36.5 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, methanogenic, mixed, active, nonacid, thermic Anthrodensic Ustorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Latrass loam-Constructed on a northwest facing, 1 percent slope; elevation is 401 m (1316 ft).  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    ^Ap--0 to 20 cm, (0 to 8 in); reddish brown (5YR 4/4) loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; massive; hard, friable; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (Thickness is 15 to 41 cm [6 to 16 in].)

    ^C--20 to 56 cm (8 to 22 in); red (2.5YR 4/6) clay loam, dark red (2.5YR 3/6) moist; massive; extremely hard, very firm; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (Thickness is 36 to 91 cm [14 to 36 in].)

    ^Cd--56 to 107 cm (22 to 42 in); red (2.5YR 5/6) clay, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; massive; extremely hard, extremely firm; moderately alkaline. (Thickness is 25 to 71 cm [10 to 28 in].)

    2^Cu--107 to 200 cm (42 to 80 in); artifacts of general refuse of trash, garbage, rocks, and/or concrete; moderately alkaline. (Thickness is 78 to 100 cm [31 to 40 in].)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Coyle, Grainola, Ironmound, Kingfisher, Norge, Renfrow, Renthin, and Teller soils. All of these soils are on similar positions.  Ironmound soils have a loamy control section and bedrock within 20 inches of the soil surface.  Coyle and Kingfisher soils have a mollic epipedon and a solum 20 to 40 inches thick.  Grainola soils have a solum 20 to 40 inches thick.  Norge and Renfrow soils have a mollic epipedon and a solum greater than 60 inches thick.  Renthin soils have a mollic epipedon and a solum 40 to 60 inches thick. Teller soils have a mollic epipedon, fine loamy control section and a solum greater than 50 inches thick.
