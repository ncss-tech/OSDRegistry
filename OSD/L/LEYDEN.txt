LEYDEN SERIES

The Leyden series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly and cobbly slope alluvium or colluvium overlying interbedded shale and sandstone. Leyden soils are on side slopes and ridges, and dip slopes of homoclinal ridges and hogbacks.  Slopes are 5 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 405 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Aridic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Leyden cobbly clay loam - grassland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 8 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) cobbly clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky; 20 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 13 cm thick)

    BA--8 to 20 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly heavy clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; slightly hard, friable, sticky; 20 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 13 cm thick)

    Bt1--20 to 48 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly heavy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, firm, sticky; common thin clay films on the faces of peds; 20 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual smooth boundary. 

    Bt2--48 to 74 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly clay, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; hard, firm, very sticky; common thin clay films on the faces of peds; 20 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons - 28 to 58 cm) 

    BC--74 to 89 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) gravelly heavy clay loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak coarse subangular blocky; hard, firm, very sticky; 20 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 18 cm thick) 

    Cr--89 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) mudstone, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).
