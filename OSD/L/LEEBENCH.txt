LEEBENCH SERIES

The Leebench series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly or moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. Leebench soils occur on alluvial fans, fan remnants, strath terraces, stream terraces, alluvial flats, and fan terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Natrargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Leebench gravelly clay loam--rangeland. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     E--0 to 3 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak platy structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine and fine vesicular pores; 20 percent gravel; strongly calcareous; carbonates are disseminated; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); clear irregular boundary. (0 to 4 inches thick)

     Btkn--3 to 8 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak prismatic structure parting to moderate subangular blocky; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine, few medium roots; few fine interstitial pores; few thin clay films in pores and on ped faces; strongly calcareous; carbonates are in splotches and veins; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 24 inches thick)

     Bk1--8 to 20 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; very few fine pores; 25 percent gravel; strongly calcareous; carbonates are disseminated and in splotches; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); gradual wavy boundary. (6 to 40 inches thick)

     Bk2--20 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; very few fine roots; 30 percent gravel; strongly calcareous; carbonates are in veins; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Azabache (NM), Fajada (NM), Hadden T (UT), Highrock (CA), Homko (UT), Leeko (UT), Muff (WY), Pizene (NV), Recapture (UT), Rusty (NV), Swasey (UT), Terlco (NV), Thermosprings T (UT), and Uffens (UT) series. Fajada, Highrock, Recapture and Terlco soils have mean annual soil temperatures of greater than 53 degrees F. and SAR value greater than 40. Azabache, Highrock, Pizene, Rusty, Swasey, and Uffens soils do not have a calcic horizon. Fajada, Hadden, Muff, and Swasey soils are 20 to 40 inches deep over bedrock. Leeko soils contain less than 15 percent rock fragments between the base of the natric horizon and 40 inches. Homko, Recapture, Rusty, and Uffens soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments below the natric horizon. Terlco soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the natric horizon.
