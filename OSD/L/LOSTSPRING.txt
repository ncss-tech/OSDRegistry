LOSTSPRING SERIES

The Lostspring series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in outwash material weathered from andesite ad pyroclastic rocks; the overburden is formed from air-laid pumice deposits.  Lostspring soils are on outwash terraces and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Cindery over medial, glassy over mixed, nonacid, frigid Vitrandic Xerorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Lostspring very cindery coarse sand--on a 2 percent slope under a forest cover of white fir, red fir, and lodgepole pine at an elevation of 5,700 feet. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated. When described on July 3, 1980, the soil was dry to 38 inches and moist to greater than 60 inches).

     A--0 to 2 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) very cindery coarse sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and common fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 40 percent medium gravel size pumice cinders; slightly acid (pH 6.5); gradual wavy boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick)

     AC--2 to 24 inches: very pale brown (10YR 8/3) extremely cindery coarse sand, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine interstitial pores; 90 percent medium gravel size pumice cinders; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear smooth boundary. (18 to 26 inches thick)

     2Bwb1--24 to 38 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable; nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; 15 percent andesitic pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.5); gradual wavy boundary. (12 to 16 inches thick)

     2Bwb2--38 to 60 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine pores; 20 percent andesitic pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.5).

TYPE LOCATION: Siskiyou County, California; about 6 miles south of Medicine Lake Guard Station; 0.4 miles from the intersection of Forest Roads 43N09 and 43N40; NE 1/4, SE 1/4,, NE 1/4, sec. 27, T. 43 N., R. 2

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The discontinuity ranges from a depth of 20 to 36 inches. Pumice cinder content averages 40 to 90 percent by volume in the upper part of the particle-size control section. Pebble content ranges from 15 to 25 percent in the lower part of the control section.  Mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 47 degrees F and the mean summer soil temperature is 60 to 65 degrees F. The soil is dry in the 24 to 41 inch moisture control section from mid-July to mid-October. It is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year. An O horizon in some pedons is less than 1 inch thick.

The A horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/3, 5/1, 6/1, 6/2, 7/2 or 7/3 and moist color of 10YR 2/1, 3/1, 3/3, 4/2, 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3 or 6/4. It is coarse sandy loam to sand with 15 to 90 percent pumice cinders. It is slightly acid or medium acid.

The 2Bwb horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/2, 6/3, or 5/4 and 7.5YR 5/4, 6/4 and moist color of 10YR 4/2, 4/3 or 4/4 and 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4, 4/6, 3/4 or 3/6. It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam with 5 to 35 percent gravel and cobbles by volume. It is weak, medium or coarse subangular blocky structure. It is slightly acid or neutral.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other soils in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lostspring soils are in drainageways on hills and outwash terraces in proximity to sources of rhyolityic pumice cinders at elevations from 4,800 to 6,400 feet. Slopes are O to 30 percent. The soils are formed in pumice cinders deposited over a soil formed from outwash material weathered from pyroclastic and andesitic flow rock.

The climate is continental and subhumid with warm, nearly dry summers and cold, moist winters. mean annual precipitation is 30 to 45 inches.  Snowfall is 20 to 45 inches and lasts from early December until early May in most years. Mean January temperature is 25 degrees to 30 degrees F; the mean July temperature is 60 degrees to 65 degrees F; the mean annual temperature is 38 degrees to 45 degrees F. Frost-free season is 40 to 65 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: See remarks.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; very slow runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for timber. Native vegetation is lodegpole pine, ponderosa pine and white fir. Shrubs are bitterbrush, rabbitbrush and gooseberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Volcanic outwash terraces and drainageways in the pumice mantle region in the northern California portion of the Cascade Range. The soils are of small extent.
