LITTLEMUD SERIES

The Littlemud series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from quartzite or rhyolite.  Littlemud soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 760 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Littlemud soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from quartzite or rhyolite.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 2,290 to 2,750 meters.  The climate is subhumid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 500 to 760 mm, the mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Hackwood and Inpendence soils.  Hackwood soils are fine-loamy, very deep, and have thick mollic epipedons.  Inpendence soils are loamy-skeletal, very deep, and have thick umbric epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; very high surface runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Littlemud soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly snowbrush ceanothus.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 25.
