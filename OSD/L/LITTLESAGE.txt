LITTLESAGE SERIES

The Littlesage series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived from calcareous shale bedrock. These soils are on hillslopes. Slopes are 1 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 5.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, smectitic, frigid, shallow Gypsic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Littlesage silty clay loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

     A--0 to 9 cm; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2), moist; weak fine granular structure; very friable, soft, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few very fine roots throughout; many very fine interstitial pores; finely disseminated carbonate; 5 percent parachanners; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline, (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 10 cm thick)                                                       

     Bky--9 to 20 cm; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) very parachannery silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2), moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable, moderately hard, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few fine and medium roots throughout; few fine tubular pores; 10 percent threadlike carbonate masses in matrix; 7 percent irregular gypsum masses in matrix; 50 percent parachanners; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 20 cm thick)    

     BCky--20 to 40 cm; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) extremely parachannery silty clay loam, very dark gray (2.5Y 3/1), moist; massive; hard, firm, sticky, plastic; few very fine roots throughout; common fine tubular pores; 10 percent threadlike and 2 percent irregular carbonate masses in matrix; 12 percent irregular gypsum masses in matrix; 80 percent parachanners; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary. (10 to 30 cm thick)     

     Cr--40 cm; shale bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained, Ksat 1.5 to 5.0 um/sec.

USE AND VEGETATION: Littlesage soils are primarily used for rangeland.  The potential native vegetation is Gardner's saltbush, shadscale saltbush, birdfoot sagebrush, shrubby buckwheat, Indian ricegrass, stemless mock goldenweed and spiny phlox. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Littlesage soils are of small extent in southwestern Wyoming. MLRA 34A.
