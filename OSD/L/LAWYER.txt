LAWYER SERIES

The Lawyer series consists of deep and very deep, well drained slowly permeable soils on steep and very steep north-facing canyon slopes. They formed in loess, slope alluvium and material weathered from Columbia River basalt or other volcanics. Slope ranges from 15 to 90 percent. The average annual temperature is 48 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is 20 inches.

Reaction - slightly acid or neutral

Some pedons have secondary lime and are moderately alkaline below a depth of 43 inches

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Badgermont, Oreoke, and Taming series.

Badgermont soils - 20 to 40 inches to bedrock; dry 90 to 105 consecutive days
Oreoke soils - dry 75 to 90 consecutive days
Taming soils -  have 0 horizons

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lawyer soils are on steep and very steep north-facing canyon slopes. Slopes range from 25 to 90 percent. The soils formed in loess, colluvium, and material weathered from Columbia River basalt or Seven Devils volcanics at elevations of 1,200 to 4,000 feet. The climate is subhumid, with an average annual temperature of 45 to 52 degrees F, and with an average annual precipitation of 17 to 24 inches including 5 to 10 feet of snow. Summers are moderately dry. The average frost-free period is 110 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bluesprin, Gwinly, Mallory, and Tannahill soils. Bluesprin soils have mollic epipedons that are 10 to 18 inches thick and are on south-facing slopes. Gwinly soils are less than 20 inches to bedrock and are dominantly on south and west-facing slopes. Mallory soils are less than 40 inches to bedrock and are on plateaus and steep south and west-facing slopes. Tannahill soils have mollic epipedons 10 to 15 inches thick, have lime above a depth of 43 inches, and are on south-facing slopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; rapid and very rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Range and recreation. The potential natural vegetation is mainly Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, prairie junegrass, snowberry and wildrose.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West-central Idaho, southeastern Washington, and northeastern Oregon; MLRA 9. The series is moderately extensive.
