LONEOAK SERIES

The Loneoak series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in materials derived from Cambrian-age sandstone. These soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping undulating plains and footslopes of ridges. Slope are 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C (66 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Campair, Matilo, Nebgen and Oben soils. 
Campair soils: have surface layers less than 51 cm (20 in) thick, are moderately deep to sandstone, and are on similar positions but mainly have convex surfaces. 
Matilo soils: have sandy surface layers more than 102 cm (40 in) thick, are very deep to sandstone, and are on slightly higher positions with plane or convex surfaces. 
Nebgen and Oben soils: are shallow to sandstone, are on higher hills and ridges, and have slopes greater than 3 percent

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained and slow permeability. Runoff is low. These soils may have a shallow perched water table above the Bt horizon and/or above the sandstone bedrock during unusually wet years for 4 to 10 weeks in duration. Typically, there are one to three wet years in a ten year period.

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used as improved pasture and cropland. Native vegetation consists of blackjack and post oak with an understory of little bluestem, big bluestem, Indiangrass, purpletop, sand lovegrass, silver bluestem, tall dropseed, Scribner's panicum and greenbriar.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Texas. Southwest Plateaus and Plains Range and Cotton Region, LRR-I; MLRA 82A-Central Basin of Texas. The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Llano County, Texas, 1990.  The name Loneoak is from a mountain in northwest Llano County.

REMARKS: 
This soil was previously included with the Demona series.

The series type location was moved to the current location with characterization data based on transects, documentation.  The series concept was also changed from deep to very deep based on transects from Mason and Llano County Soil Surveys.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 55 cm (0 to 22 in) (A1 and A2 horizons)
Argillic horizon: 55 to 155 cm (22 to 61 in) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 and Btg horizons)
Pale feature: abrupt textural change between the sandy epipedon and the argillic horizon, at 55 cm (22 in)
Arenic feature: surface layer is a sand 55 cm (22 in) thick
Paralithic contact: with sandstone bedrock at a depth of 155 cm (57 in)
Lithic contact: with sandstone bedrock at a depth of 165 cm (65 in)

ADDITIONAL DATA: Data available from the Texas AgriLife Soil Characterization Lab on pedon S89TX-319-002 and at the type location from the National Soil Survey Lab (pedon number: S09TX319002).
