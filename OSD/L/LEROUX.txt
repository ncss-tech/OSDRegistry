LEROUX SERIES

The Leroux soils consist of very deep, moderately well drained soils on mountain and valley side slopes.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from interbedded sandstone and shale and basalt.  Slopes range from 5 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 740 mm and mean annual air temperature is 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic Aquic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Leroux loam - woodland.  (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 8 cm; mat of slightly decomposed needles, twigs, and leaves.

    A1--8 to 18 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/2) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine and medium granular; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; 5 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, 1 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.

    A2--18 to 36 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/2) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 5 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, one percent stones; slightly acid; (pH 6.4) clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of A horizons - 25 to 50 cm)

    Bt1--36 to 64 cm; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many faint clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, one percent stones; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear smooth boundary.  (25 to 30 cm thick)

    Bt2--64 to 87 cm; light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) clay, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; strong fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many faint clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, one percent stones; strongly acid (pH 5.4); clear wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of Bt horizons - 50 to 80 cm)

    BCt--87 to 105 cm; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) sandy clay, reddish brown (5YR 5/3) moist; massive; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common faint clay films on faces of peds; common, medium and coarse, distinct and prominent, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redox concentrations; 5 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, one percent stones; strongly acid (pH 5.4); clear wavy boundary.  (15 to 25 cm thick)

    C--105 to 130 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) clay, brown (7.5YR 5/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common, medium and coarse, distinct and prominent, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redox concentrations; 5 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, one percent stones; strongly acid (pH 5.4); clear wavy boundary.
