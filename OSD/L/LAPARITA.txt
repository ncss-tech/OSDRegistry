LAPARITA SERIES

The Laparita series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy and clayey alluvium over residuum of the Jackson Group.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on headslopes, toeslopes and footslopes of interfluves.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent but are mainly less than 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 610 mm (24 in) and mean annual temperature is about 22.2 degrees C (72 degrees F).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for rangeland.  A few areas are cultivated in the eastern extent of the soil range.  Crops grown are mainly small grain, grain sorghum, and introduced grasses.  Present vegetation includes pink pappusgrass, threeawn, red grama, curlymesquite, Hall panicum, and bristlegrass.  Woody plants include running mesquite, twisted acacia, mesquite, white brush, lotebush condalia, agarito, wolfberry, spiny hackberry, and paloverde.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Atascosa County, Texas, MLRA 83A, 1977.

REMARKS:  Laparita soils were formerly included in the Orelia series. The Orelia series has a fine-loamy control section. This soil has a fine control section as well as Vertic Properties. The classification was changed to include the pachic vertic subgroup which is current with the Eleventh Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section: The zone from 20 to 56 cm (8 to 22 in) (Bt and Btk horizons)

Mollic epipedon: The zone from 0 to 56 cm (0 to 22 in) (A, Bt, and Btk horizon).

Argillic horizon: The zone from 20 to 56 cm (8 to 22 in) (Bt and Btk horizon).

Vertic feature: The presence of pressure facesat 20 to 76 cm (8 and 30 in).(Bt,Btk,and BCkz1 horizons)

Lithologic discontinuity: Occurs at 117 cm

ADDITIONAL DATA: Local lab data from the McMullen project office available on pedons from McMullen County.
