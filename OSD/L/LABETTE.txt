LABETTE SERIES

The Labette series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum from interbedded limestone and clayey shale. Labette soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping hillslopes on uplands in Bluestem Hills, in MLRA 76. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 790 millimeters (31 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 13 degrees C (56 degrees F), at the type location.

COMPETING SERIES:  
The Edalgo series is the only series in the family.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  
These series are the Dwight, Florence, Irwin, and Tully soils. 
Dwight soils are in open depressions and have a sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) of more than 13 (natric horizon).  
Florence soils are generally lower on the slope and are clayey-skeletal with lithic contact greater than 100 centimeters (40 inches) 
Irwin soils are in slightly higher positions on broad ridgetops and do not have a lithic contact within a depth of 100 centimeters (40 inches).  
Tully soils are on foot slopes and do not have a lithic contact within a depth of 100 centimeters (40 inches).

The series is of extensive.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Salina, Kansas

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Labette County, Kansas, 1926. The name is from the county.

REMARKS:  
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Particle-size control section: The zone from 38 to 76 centimeters (15 to 30 inches) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Mollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 38 centimeters (0 to 15 inches) (A and BA horizons)
Argillic horizon - the zone from 38 to 76 centimeters (15 to 30 inches) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Lithic contact - The contact at 91 centimeters (34 inches) (R horizon)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is based on lab data of nearby sample 83KS017001.

Keys to Taxonomy: Twelfth Edition, 2014.

1/2012 JLG Up-dated to meet MO5 Soil Technical Note-1 (Revision 3); Placed in semi-tab format, added activity class to the taxonomy class, conversion from English to metric; added the following: longitude and latitude to typical pedon, particle-size control section, sand and clay ranges in characteristics, elevation, saturated hydraulic conductivity, Land Resource Region, Major Land Resource Area, Taxonomic Version, precipitation pattern, a couple of diagnostic features, and soil moisture.

1/2012 JLG Based on lab data there is a possibility that this series could be pachic. Further investigation is needed. Saturated hydraulic conductivity needs to be reviewed. With the high clay content in the argillic horizon and based on geographically associated soils ksat's, it may be low instead of moderately low.

06/2020 BKN Updated site information for Typical Pedon and added USGS QUAD to Type Location. Updated Keys to Soil Taxonomy to Twelfth Edition.
