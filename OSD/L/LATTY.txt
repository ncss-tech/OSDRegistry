LATTY SERIES

The Latty series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in clayey glaciolacustrine sediments. These soils are on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. Soils in closely related families include the Allis and Zipp series. Allis soils are in the acid reaction class, formed in till, and have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Zipp soils have a mixed mineralogy class, formed in lacustrine or slackwater sediments, and typically have a mean annual temperature of more than 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Latty soils are on lake plains of late Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The Latty soils are often in a narrow band (1/2 to about 6 miles wide) between the Paulding soils, derived from glaciolacustrine material with more than 60 percent clay, and the Hoytville soils, derived from fine-textured till. The soils formed in clayey glaciolacustrine sediments, and in many places have till below 152 cm (60 inches). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 991 mm (29 to 39 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 12 degrees C (48 to 54 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Fulton and Nappanee soils and the Hoytville, Paulding, and Toledo, soils. The small areas of somewhat poorly drained Fulton and Nappanee soils are on slightly higher topographic positions. Fulton soils formed in lake sediments whereas Nappanee soils formed in till. Hoytville, Paulding, and Toledo, soils are on similar topographic positions as Latty soils. Hoytville soils formed in till and have a dark colored surface horizon. Paulding soils are very fine. Toledo soils have a dark colored surface horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between January and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low in the solum and low in the underlying material. Permeability is slow in the solum and very slow in the underlying material.

USE AND VEGETATION: The Latty soils are largely cultivated or used for pasture. Corn, soybeans, wheat, oats, alfalfa, and grass legume mixtures are the principal crops. Some areas are used for special crops such as tomatoes and sugar beets. Native vegetation is deciduous swamp forest of swamp white oak, bur oak, pin oak, elm, silver maple, and occasionally sycamore and basswood. Much of the ground cover consisted of coarse swampgrass, sedges, and water-tolerant shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 98, 99, and 111B in northwestern Ohio and southeastern Michigan. The type location is in MLRA 99. The series is of large extent, about 225,000 acres.

REMARKS: The classification of the Latty series changes from Epiaquepts to Endoaquepts with the revision (10/2003) based on landform position.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 25 cm (Ap horizon).
Cambic horizon: from a depth of 25 to 104 cm (Bg horizon).
Aquic conditions: matrix color with chroma of 1 or 2 between 25 and 104 cm and redox depletions and/or concentrations in all horizons below the Ap horizon.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data are available for the typical pedon, Ohio profile PD-87, and also for DF-24, HN-94, HN-96, LG-37, LS-10, MR-2, MR-6, PD-S85, and WL-20.
