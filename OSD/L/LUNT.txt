LUNT SERIES

Soils of the Lunt series are very deep and well drained with moderate permeability.  They formed in Coastal Plain sediments on sloping to moderate steep uplands.  Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is about 41 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Typic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lunt loam - cultivated.  (Colors are for moist soil)

    O--0 to 1 inch; partially decomposed hardwood leaves, pine needles and twigs.

    Ap1--1 to 2 inch; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam; moderate fine granular structure; very friable; many fine, medium and coarse roots; 1 percent quartz gravel; very strongly acid clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 3 inches thick)

    Ap2--2 to 8 inches; brown to dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) loam; moderate fine granular structure; very friable; many fine, medium and coarse roots; 1 percent quartz gravel; very strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt1--8 to 20 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay; strong medium and fine subangular blocky structure; very firm, very plastic, very sticky; many fine and medium roots, few coarse roots; few faint yellowish red (5YR 5/8) films of clay on faces of peds; 1 percent quartz gravel; few fine flakes of mica; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 20 inches thick)

    Bt2--20 to 35 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay loam; strong, medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; firm, plastic, very sticky; common fine and medium roots; common distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) films of clay on faces of peds; common fine roots; 1 percent quartz gravel; few fine flakes of mica; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 20 inches thick)

    BCt--35 to 40 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay loam with common fine and medium brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) and pale brown (10YR 6/3) mottles; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly plastic, very sticky; common fine roots; 1 percent quartz gravel; few fine flakes of mica; many common films of clay; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick)

    C1--40 to 48 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) sandy loam with many medium and fine mottles in shades of yellow, brown, red, white and green; massive, friable, sticky; common distinct and permanent films of clay on horizontal strata; few fine roots; 1 percent quartz gravel; few fine flakes of mica; very strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.

    C2--48 to 73 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) sandy loam with many fine brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) and black mottles; massive; very friable; 1 percent quartz gravel; feldspathic sands; few fine flakes of mica; very strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Prince William County, Virginia; 1340 feet west of Blackburn Road at the Junction with Maryland Drive, about 540 feet east of Route 1.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 24 to 48 inches.  Rock fragments of quartz gravel range from 1 to 20 percent in the A and E horizon, 1 to 10 percent in the B and C horizon, and up to 50 percent in thin strata of the C horizon.  The soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid, unless limed.  Few flakes of mica are in the B and C horizons.

The A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, sandy loam, loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.  Pedons with eroded surfaces include sandy clay loam.

The E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is sandy loam, loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.

The B horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 8.  It is clay, sandy clay or clay loam.  BE and BC horizons, where present, include sandy clay loam textures.

The C horizon has hue of 5YR, through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 8, and chroma of 2 through 8.  Mottling in shades of white, yellow, brown and black are common.  It is sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  The C horizon commonly has high feldspathic sand content.  Some areas have lenses and strata of gray marine clay in the C horizon.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Clinton, Hatton, Ursa, and Welda series.  These soils are dominantly formed in loess, do not have rock fragments of quartz, and do not have flakes of mica in the B and C horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lunt soils are gently sloping to moderately steep on Coastal Plain uplands.  Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent.  They formed in fluviomarine Coastal Plain sediments.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 56 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 44 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Fairfax, Keyport Marr, and Neabsco soils.  Neabsco soils have a fragipan.  Fairfax, Keyport and Marr soils have base saturation below 35 percent.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of the Lunt soils are used for urban development, idle land or woodland.  The dominant species in the wooded areas are pines, oaks, hickory, gum and poplar.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Virginia; possibly Maryland.  The series is of small extent.

REMARKS:  Type location change to Prince William County, Virginia, 1981 and reclassified.  Lunt soils are reclassified on the bases of lab data from the type location and from the established series type location.
