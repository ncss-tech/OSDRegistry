LA ROCO SERIES

The La Roco series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. La Roco soils are on flood plains and flood plain steps and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. Permeability is moderate. The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bear Lake, Blackotter, Bloomington, Chesbrook, Dinswamp, Lago, Merkley and Nuffer soils.   Bear Lake,  Blackotter and Chesbrook soils occur on similar landscape positions and are poorly drained.  Bloomington and Dinswamp soils occur on lake plains and lake terraces and are very poorly drained.  Lago soils occur on similar landscape positions and are not carbonatic.  Merkley soils occur on similar landscape positions, are moderately well drained, are not carbonatic and are coarse-silty.  Nuffer soils occur on similar landscape positions, have a pachic epipedon and are loamy-skeletal.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; negligible to low runoff; moderate permeability.  It is frequently flooded for short durations during the period April through May in most years, and at other times following periods of intense rainfall.

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used for cropland, pastureland and hayland. The potential  natural vegetation is mainly saltgrass, bluegrasses, cheatgrasses, and in places rabbitbrush, shrubby cinquefoil, bluebunch wheatgrass, western wheatgrass, sedges, rushes, giant wildrye, alkali cordgrass, willow, basin big sagebrush, threetip sagebrush and/or forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Idaho. The soils of this series are not extensive.
