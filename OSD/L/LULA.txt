LULA SERIES

The Lula series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from limestone of Pennsylvanian age.  These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping uplands in the Cherokee Prairies.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm (43 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, active, thermic Typic Argiudolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lula silt loam-in rangeland on summit of an interfluve, at an elevation of 196 meters (643 feet) above mean sea level.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Ap--0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; hard, friable; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary. [15 to 41 cm (6 to 16 inches) thick]

   Bt1--28 to 43 cm (11 to 17 inches); dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) silty clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) dry; strong medium granular structure; hard, friable; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.  [25 to 71 cm (10 to 28 inches) thick]

   Bt2--43 to 69 cm (17 to 27 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) silty clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm; clay films on faces of peds; common fine prominent red (2.5YR 4/6) redoximorphic concentrations; few fine black iron-manganese concretions; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  [0 to 61 cm (0 to 24 inches) thick]

   Bt3--69 to 107 cm (27 to 42 inches); red (2.5YR 4/6) silty clay loam, red (2.5YR 5/6) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm; clay films on faces of peds; common fine prominent dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) redoximorphic concentrations; few fine black iron-manganese concretions; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  [0 to 61 cm (0 to 24 inches) thick]

   R--107 to 112 cm (42 to 44 inches); hard limestone bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are Caspiana, Catoosa, Dardanelle, Deepwater, Mason, Mer Rouge, and Tiptonville series in the same family.  Soils in similar families are Armistead, Ashwood, Benklin, Claremore, Clareson, Fitzhugh, Newtonia, Nowata, Okay, and Reelfoot series.  Armistead, Benklin, and Reelfoot soils have wetness mottles within 16 inches of the surface.  Ashwood soils have a fine control section.  Caspiana, Deepwater, Mason Mer Rouge, Newtonia, and Tiptonville soils have a solum more than 60 inches thick.  Catoosa, Claremore, and Clareson soils have a solum less than 40 inches thick.  In addition, Clareson soils have a clayey-skeletal control section.  Dardanelle soils do not have bedrock within 60 inches of the surface.  Fitzhugh and Okay soils have a fine-loamy control section.  Nowata soils have a loamy-skeletal control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lula soils are on nearly level to gently sloping ridgetops or summits of the uplands in the Cherokee Prairies.  Slope ranges 0 to 5 percent.  The soils formed in material weathered form limestone of Pennsylvanian age.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 940 to 1143 mm (37 to 45 inches).  Mean annual temperature ranges from 13.8 to 17.7 degrees C (57 to 64 degrees F).  Elevation is 165 to 395 meters (541 to 1295 feet) above mean sea level.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices is more than 64.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Catoosa, Claremore, Clareson, and Newtonia series and Scullin, Shidler, and Summit series.  Catoosa, Claremore, Clareson, Newtonia, Scullin, and Shidler soils occur on similar areas of the landscape.  In addition, Scullin soils have a fine control section and a solum less than 40 inches thick.  Shidler soils have a solum less than 51 cm (20 inches) thick.  Summit soils occur on side slopes usually below areas of Lula soils and a fine control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained.  Potential for surface runoff is slow to medium.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.  Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for range.  The native vegetation is mainly tall grass prairie.  Minor acreage is cultivated to small grains, soybeans, grain sorghum, or tame pasture.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  MLRAs 76, 84A, 112, 116 and 117 in eastern Oklahoma, southeastern Kansas, and possibly southwest Missouri.  The type location is in MLRA 112.  The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Crawford County, Kansas; 1969.

REMARKS:  These soils were formerly included in the Newtonia series.
7/19/2002 - Cleaned up the formatting and updated the horizon nomenclature.  No other changes made.  PRF


Modified format by RGC in 2015 to include metric conversion and to update series RIC.  The type location was moved from Craig County, Oklahoma to Mayes County, Oklahoma due to the Craig County type location being change to another series (Aliceville) during an MLRA field project.
