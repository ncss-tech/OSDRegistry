LAZEAR SERIES

The Lazear series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or slope alluvium over residuum derived from interbedded sedimentary rock. Lazear soils are on structural benches, canyon walls, dip slopes, scarp slopes and homoclinal ridges. Slopes are 0 to 75 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 279 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Lithic Ustic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Lazear gravelly loam in grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  

    A--0 to 10 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 15 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 13 cm thick)

     C--10 to 36 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/3) gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 20 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  

     R--36 cm; hard calcareous sandstone bedrock.
