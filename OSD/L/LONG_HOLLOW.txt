LONG HOLLOW SERIES

The Long Hollow series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in organic deposits within glacial moraines. The Long Hollow series is typically recognized as calcareous fens. Slopes range from 1 to more than 25 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 645 millimeters (25 inches) and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C (43 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Kalkic, frigid Typic Haplohemists

TYPICAL PEDON: Long Hollow mucky peat, on a 4 percent slope. (Colors are for moist soils unless otherwise noted.)

  Oi1--0 to 25 centimeters (0 to 10 inches); 80 percent dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) broken face and 20 percent very dark grayish brown 2.5Y 3/2 broken face peat (fibric material); about 90 percent fiber rubbed that contains many small and large living roots; massive, nonsticky; strong effervescence; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear smooth boundary.

  Oi2--25 to 69 centimeters (10 to 27 inches); black (10YR 2/1) broken face peat (fibric material); about 80 percent fiber rubbed; massive; nonsticky; primarily mixed herbaceous fiber; about 2 percent woody fragments 5 millimeters in diameter by 20 millimeters long; strong effervescence; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary.

  2Oe1--69 to 86 centimeters (27 to 34 inches); 92 percent water and 8 percent black (10YR 2/1) broken face mucky peat (hemic material); about 40 percent fiber rubbed; suspended; nonsticky; primarily herbaceous fiber; about 4 percent woody fragments 5 millimeters in diameter by 20 millimeters long; slight effervescence; neutral (pH 6.7); abrupt wavy boundary. 

  3Oe2--86 to 135 centimeters (34 to 53 inches); black (10YR 2/1) broken face mucky peat (hemic material); about 35 percent fiber rubbed; massive; nonsticky; primarily herbaceous fiber; few snail shells; strong effervescence; neutral (pH 7.3); gradual wavy boundary. 

  3Oe3--135 to 200 centimeters (53 to 80 inches); black (2.5Y 2/1) broken face mucky peat (hemic material); about 30 percent fiber rubbed; massive; nonsticky; primarily herbaceous fiber; few snail shells; strong effervescence; neutral (pH 6.7); gradual wavy boundary.

TYPE LOCATION: Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) 102D-Prairie Coteau; Roberts County, South Dakota; about 2 miles south and 2 miles west of Sisseton; 1,300 feet west and 1,100 feet south of the northeast corner of section 7, T. 125 N., R. 51 W.; USGS Boulder Lake Reservoir Quadrangle, latitude 45 degrees 37 minutes 45.84seconds N. and longitude 97 degrees 04 minutes 57.72 seconds W., WGS84.  (45.6294; -97.0827)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth to carbonates - Typically calcareous throughout, but some pedons lack carbonates to a depth of 15 centimeters (6 inches) 
Few to common accumulations of calcium carbonate are in some pedons
Organic materials extend throughout the 130-centimeter control section
A porous crust-like deposit consisting of calcium carbonate (tufa), manganese and iron 2 to 13 centimeters (about 1 to 5 inches) thick occurs on the surface of some pedons
Mineral material that ranges from clay loam to loamy sand is in some pedons below a depth of 152 centimeters (60 inches)
Few to many snail shells in the lower parts of most pedons
Some pedons may have buried horizons
 
Oi horizon:
Hue -- 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR
Value -- 1 to 6
Chroma -- 2 to 4
Texture -- peat with many living roots
Reaction -- neutral to slightly alkaline
Thickness - 20 to 75 centimeters (about 8 to 30 inches)

Some pedons have Oa horizons with the colors of the Oi horizon

2Oe horizon:
Hue -- 2.5YR, 10YR or N
Value -- 2 to 5
Chroma -- 0 to 2
Texture - solids are mucky peat primarily composed of herbaceous fibers
 and averages between 2 and 20 percent woody fragments
 in some pedons there may be thin layers of muck or peat included
Reaction -- neutral to slightly alkaline
Thickness - 0 to 60 centimeters (about 0 to 24 inches)
The 2Oe horizon is water with 2 to 25 percent suspended organic solids, this horizon is fluid

Some pedons do not have a 2Oe horizon

3Oe horizon:
Hue -- 2.5YR, 10YR or N
Value -- 2 to 5
Chroma -- 0 to 2
Texture -- It is mucky peat primarily composed of sphagnum and herbaceous fibers. It averages between 2 and 20 percent woody fragments
Reaction -- neutral to slightly alkaline
Thickness - 25 to 120 centimeters (about 10 to 47 inches)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material -- organic deposits from calcareous fens 
Landform - nearly level to steep uplands within glacial moraines
Slope -- 0 to more than 25 percent
Elevation -- 260 to 650 meters (about 860 to 2130 feet) above sea level
Mean annual air temperature -- 4 to 7 degrees C (about 39 to 45 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation - 559 to 780 millimeters (about 22 to 30 inches)
Frost-free period -- 135 to 175 days
 
GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Buse, Forman, Rauville soils.
All these series lack a histic epipedon Buse -- are well drained, on shoulder slopes have a fine-loamy control section, a calcic horizon, and are on adjacent till plains
Forman -- are well drained, on backslopes have a fine-loamy control section, an argillic horizon, and are on adjacent till plains
Rauville - are very poorly drained, have a fine-silty control section, have a mollic epipedon, lack a cambic, and on adjacent floodplains or drainageways

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class - very poorly drained
Surface runoff - very low or low
Saturated hydraulic conductivity - 42.34 to 141.14 micrometers per second (very high to high)
A constant positive water potential is at the surface in all months of the year

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is primarily wildlife habitat. Native vegetation includes hair-like beak rush, lesser fringed gentian, needle beak sedge, inland sedge, water sedge, sea arrowgrass, marsh arrowgrass, three-square bulrush, and a variety of mosses, cattails, sedges, and other calciphiles. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Physiographic Division -- Interior Plains
Physiographic Province -- Central Lowland
Physiographic Section -- Western Lake Section
MLRA -- Prairie Coteau (102D)
LRR M; South Dakota and Minnesota 
Extent - minor

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Salina, Kansas

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Roberts County, South Dakota, 2024. 

REMARKS:
Series control section - the zone from the surface to a depth of 130 centimeters (about 51 inches)
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
fibric material from the surface to a depth of 69 centimeters (about 27 inches) (Oi1 and Oi2 horizons)
aquic horizon - the zone from 69 to 86 centimeters (about 27 to 34 inches) (2Oe1 horizon)
hemic material from  86 to 200 centimeters (about 34 to 80 inches) (Oe2 andOe3 horizons)

The Long Hollow series typically occurs along the east-facing slopes of the Prairie des Coteau in MLRA 102D.

Calcareous Fens are considered a threatened wetland and have legal protections in Minnesota.
