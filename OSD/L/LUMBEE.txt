MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Scotland County, North Carolina; 1966.

REMARKS: The April 1993 revision places the Lumbee series in fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, siliceous, thermic Typic Endoaquults. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 14 inches (the A and Eg horizons).
Argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 14 to 36 inches (the Btg1 and Btg2 horizons).
Contrasting particle size within 40 inches of the soil surface--at 36 inches (2Cg)
