LAVELLGA SERIES

The Lavellga series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from basalt and sandstone. Lavellga soils are on treads of dissected fan terraces and have moderately rapid permeability. Slopes are 5 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competitors.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lavellga soils are on treads of dissected fan terraces. They formed in alluvium derived from Tertiary basalt (minette) and Cretaceous sandstone. Slopes are 5 to 15 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,800 to 7,200 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches with about half falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 130 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Eagleye, Skyhawk, and Toadlena (P) soils. Eagleye soils are shallow to shale, lack diagnostic horizons, and occur on backslopes of structural benches. Skyhawk soils are moderately deep, fine-silty, and occur on adjacent risers of fan terraces. Toadlena soils are shallow, contain gypsic horizons, and occur on summits and footslopes of structural benches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Lavellga soils are used for livestock grazing.  Present vegetation is New Mexico feathergrass, blue grama, galleta, fourwing saltbush, datil yucca, and scattered Utah juniper and pinyon.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Lavellga soils are of small extent on the Four Corners Platform portion of the Colorado Plateau province in northwest New Mexico and northeast Arizona.  MLRA 35.
