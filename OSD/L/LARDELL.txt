LARDELL SERIES 

The Lardell series consists of very deep, poorly drained saline soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Aquisalids 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lardell silty clay loam, grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

Apz--0 to 8 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; very hard, firm, sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots and pores; many fine crystals of salts; strongly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick) 

Bz1--8 to 29 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/1) moist; moderate fine granular structure; very hard, firm, sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; 1- to 2-inch thick strata of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist clay loam; strongly effervescent; many fine crystals of salts; strongly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (12 to 35 inches thick) 

Bz2--29 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam stratified with thin lenses of silt loam and fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; hard, friable, sticky and slightly plastic; strongly effervescent; common fine salt crystals and disseminated salts; strongly     alkaline.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 

Landform - floodplains. 

Elevation - 2,200 to 3,600 feet. 

Slope - 0 to 8 percent. 

Parent material - alluvium that is high in soluble salts. 

Climate - long, cold winters; warm, moist springs; warm summers. 

Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 14 inches. 

Mean annual temperature - 40 to 45 degrees F. 

Frost-free period - 100 to 130 days. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Lardell soils are used mainly for range or pasture. Potential native vegetation is foxtail barley, saltgrasses, alkali sacaton, kochia, and greasewood. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Lardell soils are inextensive mainly in the Milk River Valley on the northern plains of Montana and in closed basins in the eastern plains of Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Stillwater County, Montana, 1975. 

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT0175.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - from the soil surface to 8 inches that has concentration of salts (Ap horizon); salic horizon - from 8 to 60 inches (Bz1, Bz2 horizons); particle-size   control section - from 10 to 40 inches (Bz1, Bz2 horizons).  Lardell soils have an aridic moisture regime that borders on aquic.
