LOEB SERIES

The Loeb series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types. Loeb soils are on broad ridgetops of coastal hills and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 2800 110 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).

Umbric epipedon: ranges from 25 to 50 centimeters (10 to 20 inches) thick  

Depth to a paralithic contact: is 50 to 100 centimeters. (40 to 60 inches).

COMPETING SERIES:  Competing series include the Bullgulch, Hunterscove, Macklyn, Quinliven, Vandamme, Wadecreek, and Winchuck soils.  Bullgulch and Hunterscove soils have a mean annual soil temperature less than 54 degrees F.  In addition, Bullgulch soils have an umbric epipedon 20 to 30 inches thick and hue of 10YR throughout the Bt horizon.  Hunterscove soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Macklyn soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Quinliven soils have an ochric epipedon (E horizon), and are moderately well drained with redox depletions occurring below 30 inches.  Vandamme soils have an ochric epipedon and lack coarse fragments greater than 3 inches in diameter or gravelly textures in the argillic horizon.  Wadecreek soils have a mean annual soil temperature less than 54 degrees F. and redox depletions within the lower Bt horizon.  Winchuck soils average greater than 45 percent clay in the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Loeb soils are on stable broad ridgetops of coastal hills and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium residuum derived dominantly from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types of the Dothan Formation.  Elevations are 60 meters to 396 meters (200 to 1,300 feet).  The climate is humid, characterized by warm wet winters and warm moist summers with fog.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The mean annual precipitation is 2286 to 3302(90 to 130 inches).  The mean annual temperature is 11 to 14 degrees centigrade (52 to 57 degrees F).   The frost-free period is 240 to 300 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bosland, Dulandy, Floras, Guerin, Macklyn, Vondergreen, Wedderburn, and Zwagg soils.  Bosland, Dulandy, Floras, Guerin, Macklyn, Vondergreen, and Wedderburn soils occur on adjacent ridgetops or side slopes.  Zwagg soils are on adjacent grassland areas on ridgetops and side slopes.  Bosland, Dulandy, Floras, Guerin, Wedderburn, and Zwagg soils lack argillic horizons.  Macklyn soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Vondergreen soils are somewhat poorly drained.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; moderately high to moderately low Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The soils are used for timber production, homesites, pasture, watershed, recreation, and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is Douglas-fir, coastal redwood, tanoak, California laurel, evergreen huckleberry, salal, red elderberry, western swordfern, Pacific rhododendron, cascade Oregongrape, common beargrass, and Pacific trillium.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Coastal hills and mountains of southwestern Oregon; MLRA 4B.  The series is not extensive.
