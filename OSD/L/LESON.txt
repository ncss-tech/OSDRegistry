LESON SERIES

The Leson series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in alkaline shales and clays. These soils are on nearly level or gently sloping soils occurring on interfluves and side slopes on ridges and plains on dissected plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1073 mm (42 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18.9 degrees C (66 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, thermic Udic Haplusterts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Leson clay--cropland.  Midway between microhigh and microlow. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

Branyon, Burleson and Wilson soils: are in similar or slightly lower positions.
Heiden and Ferris soils: have an A horizons with chroma 1 of 2.  
Wilson soils: have loamy surface layers and firm textured Bt horizons.  
Ferris, Heiden, and Houston Black soils: are on higher areas.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained. Runoff is medium; Permeability is very slow.  Water enters the soil rapidly when it is dry and cracked, and very slowly when it is moist.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly cultivated and used for crops such as cotton, grain sorghums, and corn.  Native grasses are mainly bluestem, indiangrass, and gramas.  Improved pastures are planted to bermudagrass and lovegrass.  Scattered trees include bois d'arc, hackberry, elm, post oak, and locust.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The Blackland Prairies of Texas.  (MLRA(s) 86A, and possibly in 85 and 133B.  The series is extensive.
