LETHA SERIES



The Letha series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils

on low terraces.  They formed in alluvium from acid igneous rocks.

Permeability is moderate.  Slopes are 0 to about 3 percent.  The

average annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the average annual

air temperature is about 49 degrees F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Aeric Halaquepts

Halaquepts.



TYPICAL PEDON:  Letha fine sandy loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry

soil unless otherwise noted.)



    A--0 to 6 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) fine sandy loam, light

olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; moderate very thin platy and weak very

fine granular structure; friable, slightly sticky; many roots; many

very fine and fine pores; slightly effervescent; very strongly alkaline

(pH 9.4); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)



    Bk1--6 to 11 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) fine sandy

loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; weak coarse and medium

subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky; common

roots; common very fine pores; strongly effervescent; very strongly

alkaline (pH 9.7); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 7 inches thick)



    Bk2--11 to 27 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) fine sandy

loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky

structure; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic;

common roots; few very fine pores; few thin dark grayish brown (10YR

4/2) films on ped faces; strongly effervescent; very strongly alkaline

(pH 10.4); gradual smooth boundary.  (10 to 22 inches thick)



    Bn--27 to 35 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) fine sandy

loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; massive; very hard, very

friable, slightly sticky; common roots; few very fine pores; slightly

effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 10.2); abrupt smooth

boundary.  (6 to 10 inches thick)



    C1--34 to 43 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 7/3) fine sandy loam, olive

(2.5Y 4/3) and grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; few medium faint light

olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) and dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) mottles;

massive; friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few roots; few

very fine pores; slightly effervescent; very strongly alkaline; abrupt

smooth boundary.  (3 to 9 inches thick)



    2C2--43 to 60 inches; very gravelly coarse sand; single grain;

loose; slightly effervescent in places; strongly alkaline.  (several

feet thick)



TYPE LOCATION:  Gem County, Idaho; about seven miles west of Emmett;

500 feet north and 60 feet east of the southwest corner of the NW 1/4

section 8, T.6N., R.2W.



RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:



Average annual soil temperature - 49 to 54 degrees F

Depth to mottles - 20 to 40 inches

Depth to water table - 36 to 48 inches; May through September

Sodium saturation - greater than 50 percent in some part of the upper

20 inches

Texture of control section - SL, FSL

Clay content of control section - 5 to 15 percent

Reaction - moderately to very strongly alkaline



A horizon

Hue - 10YR or 2.5Y

Value - 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist

Chroma - 2 or 3



COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Argenta, Dunphy and Wabuska soils.

Argenta soils have 20 percent or more durinodes in a friable matrix

above a depth of 40 inches.  Dunphy soils have weak silica cementation

within 40 inches of the surface.  Wabaska soils have average annual

soil temperatures of 54 to 59 degrees F.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Letha soils are on low terraces at elevations of

2,000 to 3,500 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to about 3 percent.  The

soils formed in moderately coarse textured alluvium derived from coarse

grained acid igneous rocks.  The average annual precipitation is 8 to

12 inches, including 1 to 3 feet of snow.  Average annual temperature

is 47 to 52 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 140 to 160 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Baldock soils

and the Falk and Moulton soils.  Falk and Moulton soils are

noncalcareous.  These soils are on landscape positions similar to Letha

soils.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; slow runoff;

moderate permeability.  A fluctuating water table is at depths of about

36 to 48 inches in summer.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Chiefly irrigated pasture or rangeland.

Vegetation in the potential natural plant community is greasewood,

saltgrass, and basin wildrye.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Idaho and southeastern Oregon.

Moderately extensive.
