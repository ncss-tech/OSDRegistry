LOBEISNER SERIES

The Lobeisner series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess and silty alluvium in intermittent drainageways on toeslopes of buttes.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the average annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Calcidic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lobeisner silt loam, cultivated, in a drainageway, on a 2 percent southwest-facing slope, at 4,365 feet elevation. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(0 to 8 inches thick)

   AB--5 to 10 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine, fine and medium vesicular and tubular pores;  slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick)

   Bw--10 to 17 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium angular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine, fine and medium vesicular and tubular pores;  slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.

  Bk1--17 to 26 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine and medium angular blocky; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores;  violently effervescent (about 20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 28 inches thick)

  Bk2--26 to 45 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine and medium angular blocky; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine and few coarse tubular pores; matrix is strongly effervescent, many large soft bodies and seams are violently effervescent (about 25 percent calcium carbonate);  moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (6 to 28 inches thick)

  2Bkq--45 to 58 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; discontinuous weakly cemented medium platy structure; hard, very firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine irregular pores; continuous distinct pressure faces; few fine and medium segregated seams which are violently effervescent in a non-effervescent matrix (20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); 5 percent weakly cemented nodules; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 20 inches thick)

  2Btkb--58 to 68 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few very fine irregular pores; continuous distinct pressure faces; few faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; common fine segregated seams that are violently effervescent in a non-effervescent matrix (20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).

COMPETING SERIES:  The Pern (T) series is the only competing series.  Pern soils are calcareous throughout.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lobeisner soils occur in intermittent drainageways on toeslopes of buttes.  Lobeisner soils formed in loess and silty alluvium.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 48 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 11 to 13 inches.  The frost-free season is 90 to 100 days.  Elevation ranges from 4,200 to 4,500 feet.  Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chijer, Kinzie (T) and Marley (T) series. Chijer soils are calcareous to the soil surface.  Kinzie and Marley soils have argillic horizons.  Kinzie and Marley soils are in convex positions.  Chijer soils are on broad, gently sloping terraces.  Lobeisner soils are in drainageways.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Soils are used for irrigated crops such as alfalfa and wheat.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South central Idaho.  Lobeisner soils are of small extent.
