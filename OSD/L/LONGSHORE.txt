LONGSHORE SERIES

The Longshore series consists of very deep, well drained soils that weathered from fine-grained sandstone. The Longshore soils are on side slopes and uplands of the coastal plain. Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C.
