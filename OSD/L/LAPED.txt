LAPED SERIES

The Laped series consists of shallow over duripan, well drained soils formed in alluvium residuum and colluvium derived from rhyolitic tuffs, basalt and andesite.  Laped soils are on plateaus, table lands, calderas, mountains, foothill and hill summits, crests, shoulders, side slopes and summits.  Slopes are 1 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Typic Argidurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Laped gravelly loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The surface is covered by approximately 30 percent gravel.

    A1--0 to 8 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate thin platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine vesicular pores; 20 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 cm thick)

    A2--8 to 15 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate very thin platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and common medium roots; many very fine and fine vesicular pores; 5 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 13 cm thick)

    Bt--15 to 30 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; few thin clay films on peds and bridging sand grains; 10 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 18 cm thick)

    Btk--30 to 46 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine prismatic structure parting to strong fine angular blocky; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; few thin clay films on peds and bridging sand grains 15 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; few fine strongly effervescent lime filaments and thin lime coatings on undersides of coarse fragments; noneffervescent matrix; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 6 cm thick)

    Bkqm--46 to 58 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) indurated duripan with 2 mm thick laminae cap, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; extremely hard and extremely firm; violently effervescent; clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 25 cm thick)

    R--58 cm; hard bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lander County, Nevada, approximately 52 miles southwest of Battle Mountain, about 1,800 feet south and 400 feet west of the northeast corner of section 22, T. 24 N., R. 40 E; USGS Gilbert Creek NW 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 56 minutes 27 seconds N and longitude 117 degrees 27 minutes 16 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.9413889 latitude, -117.4547222 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist for short periods in winter and early spring, dry in May through October; typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C.
Depth to duripan: 36 to 50 cm.
Depth to bedrock: 50 to 76 cm.
Other features: Some pedons have a thin Bkq horizon above the duripan.  Some pedons are slightly effervescent due to recharge from airborne dust.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  27 to 35 percent.
Rock fragments:  15 to 35 percent mainly gravel.

A horizon
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4.

Bt horizon
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR.
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma:  4 through 6.
Structure: Prismatic, angular blocky or subangular blocky.
Texture:  Gravelly clay loam or gravelly silty clay loam
Reaction:  Moderately alkaline with lower subhorizons of some pedons being strongly alkaline.
Sodicity (SAR):  Ranges from 2 to 10, with the concentration usually increasing with depth.
Carbonates:  Lower subhorizon, noneffervescent to slightly effervescent matrix with secondary carbonates as filaments or coats common in most pedons.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cleaver, Corder, Shoofly, Silent, Spanel and Tumtum series.  

Cleaver, Shoofly, Silent Spanel and Tumtum soils do not have a lithic contact within 150 cm. Corder soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Laped soils are on plateaus, mountains, table lands, calderas, foothill and hill side slopes, crests, shoulders and summits.  They formed in alluvium, residuum and colluvium from rhyolitic tuff, andesite and basalt. Elevations are 1,160 to 1,955 meters.  Slopes are 1 to 50 percent.  The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is about 130 to 230 mm; mean annual temperature is about 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 90 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Colbar, Old Camp, Osoll, and Puett series.  Colbar soils lack a duripan and have a lithic contact at 50 to 100 cm.  Old Camp soils lack a duripan and have an aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.  Osoll soils are loamy-skeletal and lack an argillic horizon.  Puett soils lack diagnostic horizons and are shallow to a paralithic contact.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is mainly shadscale, bud sagebrush, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Laped soils are in north-central Nevada and Southwestern Idaho. These soils are extensive, MLRA 24 and 25.
