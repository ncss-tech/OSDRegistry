LOMITAS SERIES

The Lomitas series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in alluvium and colluvium.  Lomitas soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 5 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 71 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, hyperthermic Lithic Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON: Lomitas very stony loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 2 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very stony loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak thin platy structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common very fine vesicular and common medium tubular pores; 70 percent stones, cobble and gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick)

    Bw--2 to 10 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) extremely gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few fine tubular pores; 75 percent gravel and cobble; calcium carbonate coatings on undersides of gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 12 inches thick)

    Bk--10 to 13 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) extremely gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; 80 percent gravel and cobble; continuous calcium carbonate coatings on all gravel and cobble; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt irregular boundary. (0 to 3 inches thick)

    2R--13 inches; hard andesitic tuff; continuous calcium carbonate coatings on surfaces and in fractures; few fine roots in rock fractures.

TYPE LOCATION: Pima County, Arizona; Organ Pipe National Monument; 660 feet east and 550 feet north of the southwest corner of section 11, T.18 S., R.5 W.  Latitude 31 degrees, 52 minutes, 4 seconds N., Longitude 112 degrees, 45 minutes, 31 seconds W., NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Angelpoint (CA) and Blackeagle (T)(CA) series. Angelpoint and Blackeagle soils are moist in some part of the soil moisture control section for less than 20 days cumulative between July and September.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lomitas soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 5 to 65 percent.  They formed in alluvium and colluvium from andesite, rhyolite, tuff, volcanic breccia, basalt and to some extent metamorphic rocks.  Elevation is 1,000 to 3,000 feet.  Mean annual precipitation is 2 to 10 inches occurring as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rain.  Mean annual air temperature is 69 to 78 degrees F.  Frost-free period is about 240 to 350 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Contine, Ebon, Gunsight, Momoli and Pinamt series.  Contine, Ebon and Pinamt soils are very deep and have argillic horizons.  Gunsight soils are very deep and have calcic horizons.  Momoli soils are very deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing.  The vegetation is creosotebush, brittlebush, triangle, bursage, paloverde, ocotillo, saguaro, organ pipe cactus and cholla.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South Central and Southwestern Arizona. MLRA is 40. The series is moderately extensive.
