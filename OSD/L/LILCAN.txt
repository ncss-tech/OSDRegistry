LILCAN SERIES

The Lilcan series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or slope alluvium over residuum derived from limestone, dolomite, or sandstone.  Lilcan soils are on hillslopes, mountain slopes and summits. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Calcixerolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Lilcan gravelly silt loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    A--0 to 3 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, non-sticky and non-plastic; many very fine, fine and few medium roots; many fine irregular pores; slightly effervescent; 30 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick) 

    Bk1--3 to 9 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very cobbly silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, non-sticky and non-plastic; many very fine, fine and few medium roots; many fine irregular pores; common fine threads and carbonate masses; strongly effervescent; 30 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 8 inches thick) 

    Bk2--9 to 15 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely cobbly silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, non-sticky and non-plastic; many very fine, fine and few medium roots; common fine irregular pores; many fine and medium threads and carbonate masses; violently effervescent; 30 percent gravel and 40 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 6 inches thick)

    R--15 inches; limestone.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Hotspot and Shagel series.  Hotspot soils are in areas that average 12 to 14 inches of annual precipitation and are on lava plains. Shagel soils are in areas that average 10 to 14 inches of annual precipitation and were formed in rhyolite. 
 
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform: hillslopes, mountain slopes and summits
Elevation: 5,950 to 7,600 feet
Slope: 2 to 50 percent
Parent material: alluvium or slope alluvium over residuum derived from 	limestone, dolomite, or sandstone.
Climate: long, cold winters; moist springs; warm, dry, summers. 
Average annual precipitation: 15 to 24 inches
Average annual temperature: 39 to 45 degrees F. 
Frost-free season: 70 to 90 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Jacanyon series. The Jacanyon soils are fine-loamy and moderately deep to bedrock. They are on backslopes and shoulders of hills.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; very low to medium surface runoff; moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Lilcan soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly curlleaf mountain mahogany, mountain big sagebrush, low sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, arrowleaf balsamroot, serviceberry, snowberry, and few Rocky Mountain juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Idaho. These soils are of small extent. MLRA 43B.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Bear Lake County, Idaho, 2008. The name is coined from nearby Little Canyon.

Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 9 inches (A and Bk1 horizons). 

Calcic horizon - The zone from 3 to 15 inches (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons).

Lilcan soils are in a frigid temperature regime and a xeric moisture regime.
