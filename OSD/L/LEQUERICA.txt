LEQUERICA SERIES

The Lequerica series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed volcanic ash and loess over old alluvium. Lequerica soils are on footslopes and toeslopes of hills.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.
