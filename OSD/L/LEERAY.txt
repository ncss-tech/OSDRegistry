LEERAY SERIES

The Leeray series consists of very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous, clayey slope alluvium.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils occurs on toeslopes on ridges of hills.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).

Lazbuddie soil: has over 50 percent carbonate in the calcic horizon and formed in lacustrine deposits of quaternary age.
Hollister soils: do not have a calcic horizon, do not exhibit gilgai microrelief in most pedons, and occur in a slightly drier climate (MLRA 78C).
Indiahoma soils: do not have a calcic horizon, are 5YR or redder in the lower part of the solum, and exhibit linear gilgai.
Roscoe soils: do not have a calcic horizon, are moderately well drained, and are not saline in the lower part of the solum.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Hensley, Lindy, Palopinto, Rowden, Set, and Thurber series.  
Hensley and Lindy soils: have reddish, clayey argillic horizons, over limestone bedrock and are on summits or shoulders positions of ridges.  
Palopinto soils: are less than 50 cm (20 in) to of limestone bedrock and are above on sideslopes and shoulders of ridges.
Rowden soils: are 50 to 100 cm (20 40 in) to limestone bedrock and are slightly higer positions.  
Set soils: have fine-silty control sections and are on footslopes and backslopes of ridges.
Thurber soils: have clayey argillic horizons and are on footslopes of ridges.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is very slow.  Runoff is high on slopes less than 1 percent, very high on slopes greater than 1 percent slopes.  Water enters to soil rapidly when it is dry and cracked, and very slowly when it is moist.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for cropland and range.  Small grains, forage sorghums, and grain sorghums are the main crops. Native vegetation is mostly sideoats grama, vine-mesquite, Texas wintergrass, Arizona cottontop, buffalograss, mesquite, pricklypear, and condalia.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Texas; LRR H - Central Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range Region, MLRA 80B - Texas north-central prairies and MLRA 78A - Rolling Limestone Prairie; The series is of large extent.

REMARKS: 
Edited 01/2017 (RFG & SCP):  Classification change from Typic Haplusterts to Calcic Haplusterts based on laboratory data from Stephens County.  Calcium carbonate percentages indicate the need for the change.
Changed to tabular format and included metric values.  Updated competing series, geographic setting, and associated soils sections. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - 0 to 42 cm (0 to 17 in). (A1, A2 and Bss horizons).
Cambic horizon - 42 to 140 cm (17 to 55 in). (A2, Bss, Bkss horizons).
Calcic horizon - 140 to 203 cm (55 to 86 in). (Bk and BCkss horizons).
Vertic features - Slickensides from 28 to 139 cm (11 to 55 in), cracks 2 to 7 cm wide that extend from the surface to a depth of more than 50 cm when the soil is dry.  Cracks remain open from 150 to 210 cumulative days during most years. In undisturbed areas there is gilgai microrelief with mircohighs 10 to 30 cm higher than microlows.  Cycles of microhighs and microlows are repeated each 2 to 7 m.
