TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mesic, coated Spodic Quartzipsamments

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lakewood sand, forested. (Colors are for moist soil.)

    Oi--1 to 0 inches; slightly decomposed plant material composed of loose pine needles, oak leaves, and twigs and in part mosses or lichens discontinuous but covering nearly 50 percent of the surface. (0 to 2 inches thick)

    A--0 to 1 inches; black (10YR 2/1) sand; single grain; loose; common medium roots; extremely acid; clear broken boundary. (0 to 4 inches thick)     

    E--1 to 10 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sand; single grained; loose; few medium roots; extremely acid; gradual irregular boundary. (8 to 24 inches thick)

    Bh--10 to 14 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sand; single grained; loose; few fine roots; tongues of E material spaced 1 to 3 feet apart extend into this horizon; extremely acid; gradual wavy boundary. (1 to 6 inches thick)

    BC--14 to 36 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) in the upper part fading to brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) in the lower part, sand; single grained; loose; few fine roots; many very thin organic and sesquioxides coatings on sand grains becoming thinner with depth; extremely acid; diffuse wavy boundary. (6 to 26 inches thick)

    C--36 to 60 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) sand; single grained; loose, faintly stratified; extremely acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Ocean County, New Jersey; 30 feet north of New Jersey Highway 70, 60 feet west of Beth Am Cemetery, 0.9 miles west of the Garden State Parkway.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Solum Thickness: 30 to 50 inches
Depth to Bedrock: Greater than 60 inches
Depth to Seasonal High Water Table: Greater than 60 inches
Rock Fragments: 0 to 15 percent, by volume in the A, E, and B horizons and 0 to 30 percent in the C horizon, mostly gravel
Soil Reaction: Extremely acid to very strongly acid throughout the profile, unless limed

RANGE OF INDIVIDUAL HORIZONS:
Oi horizon:
Texture--slightly decomposed plant material, mostly leaves, needles, and twigs

A horizon:
Color--hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 1 or 2
Texture--sand or loamy sand

Ap horizon (if it occurs):
Color--hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 1 or 2
Texture--sand or loamy sand

E horizon:
Color--hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 4 to 8
Texture--sand or loamy sand

Bh horizon:
Color--hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 3 to 8
Texture--sand or loamy sand

BC horizon:
Color--hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 3 to 8
Texture--sand or loamy sand

C horizon:
Color--hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, chroma of 4 through 8
Texture (fine-earth fraction)--sand, loamy sand, or sandy loam

COMPETING SERIES: None

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: Coastal Plain
Landform: Marine terraces
Elevation: 25 to 450 feet
Parent Material: Sandy marine sediments
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 47 to 56 degrees F.
Mean Annual Precipitation: 40 to 48 inches
Frost Free Period: 175 to 210 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Atsion soils--poorly drained spodosols, on lower-lying positions
Berryland soils--very poorly drained spodosols, on lower-lying positions
Downer soils--well drained, have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section, on similar landforms
Evesboro soils--do not have thin Bh horizons, on similar landforms
Klej soils--somewhat poorly drained and a seasonal high water table at 12 to 24 inches, on lower-lying positions
Lakehurst soils--moderately well drained and have a seasonal high water table at 18 to 42 inches. on lower-lying positions
Pittsgrove soils--well drained, have an argillic and weakly expressed fragipan horizon, on similar landforms
Woodmansie soils--well drained and have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section, on adjacent ridges

MAJOR USES: Dominantly woodland

VEGETATION: Wooded areas are dominantly pitch pine, black oak, and white oak. Where wildfires have been severe the trees are dwarfed, growing less than 5 feet tall and consist primarily of pitch pine, scrub oak, and blackjack oak.

DISTRIBUTION: New Jersey and possibly Maryland

EXTENT: Large

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Freehold area of New Jersey, 1913

REMARKS: Laboratory studies indicate Lakewood soils do not meet the requirements for spodic materials.

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 10 inches (A horizon)
Cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 10 to 36 inches (Bh and BC horizons)
