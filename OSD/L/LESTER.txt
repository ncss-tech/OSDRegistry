LESTER SERIES

The Lester series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous, loamy till. These soils are convex slopes on moraines and till plains. Slope ranges from 5 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 735 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Dakota County, Minnesota, l945.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 18 to 68 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 152 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 18 centimeters (Ap horizon);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 18 to 97 centimeters (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons);
calcic horizon--the zone from a depth of 97 to 152 centimeters (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Mollic subgroup based on the colors of the upper 18 centimeters after mixing.

Areas with slopes of 1 to 5 percent that were previously correlated as Lester may be included with the Angus series in the future.
