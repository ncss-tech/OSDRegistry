LUMPYRIDGE SERIES

The Lumpyridge series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist.  Lumpyridge soils are on fans.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, micaceous, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lumpyridge coarse sandy loam, on a north facing, convex, 9 percent slope in grass and scattered ponderosa pine at an elevation of 7,783 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on July 10, 1998 the soil was moist from 0 to 45 inches.

    The surface is covered by 5 percent gravel

    A1--0 to 6 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly coarse sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots and common very fine; 15 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

    A2--6 to 11 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots and common very fine; 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 7 inches thick)

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the paramicaceous family.  Similar series in the mixed family are the Beartooth(MT), Beeno(WY), Bookcliff(UT), Empedrado(CO), Fairfield(MT), Hangdo(UT), Hoppers(MT), Hyalite(MT), Lininger(CO), Maudlin(CO), Meagher(MT), Moen(CO), Pianohill(MT), Reedwest(MT), Sponsellor(AZ), Trag(CO), Trazuni(NM), Tschicoma(NM), and Ulrant(WY) series.   Beartooth, Empedrado, Fairfield, and Meagher soils have horizons of secondary carbonate.  Beeno, Hoppers, Lininger, and Reedwest soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Bookcliff, Tschicoma, and Ulrant soils have a lithic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Hangdo soils are slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline.  Hyalite soils have a lithologic discontinuity above 25 inches.  Maudlin, Moen, and Pianohill soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Sponsellor soils have a hue of 5YR or redder.  Trag soils do not have a lithologic discontinuity.  Trazuni soils have redoximorphic features at depths of 35 to 50 inches and are dry in the months of May and June.

ADDITIONAL DATA:


The mineralogy class was changed from paramicaceous to micaceous in 07/2010 by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the responsible MLRA regional office.  The change was necessary based on the eleventh edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2010.
