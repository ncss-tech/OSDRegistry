LEEKO SERIES

The Leeko series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.  Leeko soils are on strath terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Natrargids

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The potential native vegetation is dominantly shadscale, Castle Valley saltbush, galleta, snakeweed, mat saltbush, spiny horsebush, pricklypear, and bottlebrush squirreltail.  This soil has been correlated to the Desert Alkali Bench (Castle Valley Saltbush) - 034XY101UT range site at the type location in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern Utah.  LRR D, MLRA 34.  This series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Grand County, Utah-Central Part, 1982.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 2 inches.  (E horizon)

Natric horizon:  The zone from 2 to 16 inches.  (Btn and Btkn horizons)

Calcic horizon:  The zone from 7 to 60 inches.  (Btkn, Bk1, Bk2, and 2Bky horizons)

Lithologic discontinuity:  The presence of loamy-skeletal materials starting at the upper boundary of the 2Bky horizon.

ADDITIONAL NOTES:  Taxonomic Version:  Eighth Edition, 1998.

The CEC clay activity class was inferred from laboratory data in the Uintah Area Soil Survey.

Leeko in Grand County where this series was established is outside the range of the series control section for the Leeko series.  It has a loamy substratum, warmer MAAT (51 to 55 degrees) and a longer FFP (140 to 170 days).
