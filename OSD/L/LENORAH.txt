LENORAH SERIES

The Lenorah series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous, loamy eolian deposits over sandy alluvium derived from the Tahoka Formation of Pleistocene age. These nearly level soils are on valley flats and ancestral drainageways. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 483 millimeters (19 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).

Cedarlake series: has total clay content of 40 to 50 percent in the particle-size control section and has vertic properties. 
Hindman series: has less than 18 percent silicate clay in the particle-size control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: calcareous, loamy eolian deposits over sandy alluvium derived from the Tahoka Formation of Pleistocene age. 
Landform: are on valley flats and ancestral drainageways.
Slope: 0 to 1 percent.
Mean annual air temperature: 14 to 17 degrees C (57 to 63 degrees F).
Mean annual precipitation: 432 to 533 millimeters (17 to 21 inches).
Frost-free period: 185 to 220
Elevation: 792 to 1,189 meters (2,600 to 3,900 feet).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the similar Arch, Cedarlake, 
Hindman, Midessa, and Portales soils and the Arvana, Drake, Kimberson, Posey, Potter, Sharvana, and Tokio soils.
Arch, Hindman, Lenorah, and Midessa soils are on similar landscape positions.
Arvana, Kimberson, and Sharvana soils are on higher landscape positions and have a petrocalcic horizon.
Cedarlake soils are on lower landscape positions.
Drake soils are on higher landscape positions and have a sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) less than 13.
Posey soils are on higher landscape positions and have an argillic horizon.
Potter soils are on higher landscape positions and have carbonatic mineralogy.
Tokio soils are on slightly higher landscape positions and have an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained and moderate permeability. 
Surface runoff is negligible on less than 1 percent slopes. These soils are rarely flooded for very brief periods. An apparent water table occurs at a depth of 75 to 150 cm (30 to 60 inches) during the fall through spring months during most years. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for rangeland or wildlife but cotton and grain sorghum are grown in some areas. The natural plant community is a mixture of salt tolerant grasses and grass-like plants, forbs, and shrubs. Vegetation on most of the site is shrub dominant with saltcedar, Tamarix and Baccharis being the two most prevalent species. Occasionally there will be a few willows and cottonwoods present. In open areas and in the understory there are varying 
amounts of alkali sacaton, Texas dropseed, creeping muhly, jointtail, sedge and rushes, inland saltgrass and occasionally some western wheatgrass. Forbs include portulaca sp., kochia, smartweed, dock and annual forbs. In extreme saline areas vegetation is sparse. This soil has been correlated to the Wet Saline (R077CY689TX) ecological site in MLRA-77C.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Southern High Plains of western Texas and eastern New Mexico (sub-MLRA-77C).  The series is of minor extent.
