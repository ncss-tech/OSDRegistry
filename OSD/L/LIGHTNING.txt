LIGHTNING SERIES

The Lightning series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in loamy and clayey alluvium of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level or slightly concave soils are on flood plains mostly in the Cherokee Prairies (MLRA 112).  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1020 mm (40 inches).  Mean annual air temperature is about 15.6 degrees C. (60 degrees F.). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, thermic Chromic Vertic Epiaqualfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lightning silt loam- in rangeland on a floodplain, at an elevation of 199 meters (653 feet) above mean sea level.  (Colors are for moist soils unless otherwise stated.)

   A--0 to 28 centimeters (0 to 11 inches); dark gray (10YR 4/1) silt loam, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; moderate fine granular structure; hard, friable; few fine roots; few fine pores; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  [10 to 36 centimeters (4 to 14 inches) thick]

   Btg1--28 to 51 centimeters (11 to 20 inches); dark gray (10YR 4/1) silty clay loam, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable few fine roots; few fine pores; few fine distinct light gray redoximorphic depletions; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.  [8 to 25 centimeters (3 to 10 inches) thick)]

   Btg2--51 to 91 centimeters (20 to 36 inches), dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; weak fine and medium blocky structure; very hard, firm; few fine roots; few fine pores; thin coatings of gray (10YR 6/1) on faces of some peds; patchy clay films on faces of peds; common medium distinct gray (10YR 6/1) redoximorphic depletions; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  [25 to 51 centimeters (10 to 20 inches) thick]

   Btg3--91 to 152 centimeters (36 to 60 inches), very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak medium blocky structure; very hard, firm; few vertical cracks and old root channels filled with light gray silty clay loam; few patchy clay films on faces of peds; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lightning soils are on nearly level or slightly concave flood plains on river valleys.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  The soils formed in clayey alluvium.  Climate is warm and moist subhumid to humid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1143 mm (36 to 45 inches).  Mean annual temperature ranges from 13.3 to 17.8 degrees C. (57 degrees to 64 degrees F.).  Elevation is 137.2 to 365.8 m (450 to 1200 feet) above mean sea level.  Thornthwaite P-E index is 64 to 80.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Helper, McCune, Osage, and Verdigris series.  Helper and Verdigris soils have a fine-silty control section and occur on similar landscape positions.  Osage soils lack an argillic horizon and occur on similar landscape positions.  McCune soils have a fine-silty control section and occur on low terraces on plains. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Poorly drained.  Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table is within 30 centimeters (12 inches) of the surface for short periods from November to April in normal years.  Potential for surface runoff is negligible.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low.  Lightning series is subject to occasional flooding for brief periods during January through July in normal years.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Some areas are cultivated cropland.  Principal crops are small grains, grain sorghum, and soybeans.  Some areas are used for tame pasture or native range.  Native vegetation consists of bottomland hardwoods with an under story of grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  MLRA 112 in southeastern Kansas, southwestern Missouri, eastern Oklahoma and possibly western Arkansas..  The series is of moderate extent.
