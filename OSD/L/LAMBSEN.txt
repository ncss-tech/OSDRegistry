LAMBSEN SERIES

The Lambsen series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone, shale, limestone and quartzite rocks.  Lambsen soils are on strath terraces. Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Lambsen loam, on a southeast facing, 1 percent slope in irrigated pasture at an elevation of 5,440 feet. Surface cover of undecomposed litter 1 to 2 inches thick. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 5 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, common medium, few coarse roots; many very fine and fine, common medium tubular pores; slightly effervescent (11 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear wavy boundary.

    A2--5 to 9 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine and very fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, common medium, few coarse roots; many very fine, common fine, few medium tubular pores; slightly effervescent (8 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); clear irregular boundary.

    Bk2--25 to 35 inches; pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) very cobbly clay loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine subangular blocky; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine, common fine and medium, few coarse roots; many very fine, few fine tubular pores; 25 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent (22 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated and segregated as many rounded medium and coarse masses; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary.

    Bk3--35 to 47 inches; pink (7.5YR 8/4) extremely cobbly clay loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine subangular blocky; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, few fine and medium roots; common very fine, few fine tubular pores; 45 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; strongly effervescent (19 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated and segregated as many rounded medium and coarse masses; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary.
