LAGALL SERIES

The Lagall series consists of very deep, well drained soils on canyons, dissected tablelands, escarpments of plateaus, foothills and mountains.  These soils formed in local alluvium or colluvium derived from mixed sources.  Lagall soils have moderate permeability.  Slopes are 4 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Vitrandic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lagall very gravelly ashy loam, on a 32 percent slope with south aspect at 6600 feet elevation, in a Douglas-fir/common snowberry plant association, woodland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    0i--0 to 1 inch; forest litter of needles, leaves, twigs and stems; abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick)

    A1--1 to 8 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) very gravelly ashy loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots, common coarse roots; many very fine irregular and tubular pores; 25 percent pebbles, 5 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    A2--8 to 16 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) very cobbly ashy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common very fine through coarse roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores, common very fine tubular pores; 15 percent pebble, 35 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick) 

    Bw--16 to 24 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely cobbly ashy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots, few coarse roots; many very fine irregular pores, few very fine tubular pores; 35 percent pebbles, 35 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt wavy boundary.  (5 to 40 inches thick)

    BC--24 to 62 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely cobbly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine through medium roots; many very fine irregular pores, common very fine tubular pores; 20 percent pebbles, 40 percent cobbles and 20 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.4).

COMPETING SERIES:

Lowland (MT) - have an ustic moisture regime

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - canyons, dissected tablelands, escarpments of plateaus, foothills and mountains
Elevation -  5300 to 8500 feet
Slope - 4 to 70 percent
Parent material - local alluvium or colluvium derived from igneous and sedimentary rocks, loess and volcanic ash
Climate - Cool winters, warm summers.  Precipitation is well-distributed throughout the year. A winter snowpack of 3 to 5 feet in depth and lasting through April is common. 
Mean annual temperature - 36 to 41 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation - 18 to 25 inches
Frost free period - 30 to 60 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Koffgo, Povey and Rhylow series. Koffgo and Rhylow soils are in more moist positions on nearby canyons, dissected tablelands, escarpments of plateaus, foothills and mountains.  Koffgo soils have an ochric epipedon and Rhylow soils have an umbric epipedon.  Povey soils are on slightly warmer and drier positions. They have a mollic epipedon greater than 16 inches thick and a xeric moisture regime.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained,  moderate or high runoff,  moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Lagall soils are used for livestock grazing, recreation, timber production and wildlife habitat.  These soils commonly support forested communities dominated by Douglas-fir, subalpine fir or quaking aspen.  The potential natural communities are the Douglas-fir/common snowberry plant association and the subalpine fir/mallow ninebark plant association.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho.  They are of moderate extent.
