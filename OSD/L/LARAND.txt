LARAND SERIES

The Larand series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial till or glacial outwash materials derived from granitic and metamorphic rocks.  Larand soils are on alluvial fans and mountain side slopes. Slopes are 2 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Glossocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Larand fine sandy loam - forest land.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 3 cm; undecomposed organic material, mostly needles, bark, and twigs.

    Oe--3 to 6 cm; partially decomposed organic material like that of the horizon above.

    E--6 to 31 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) fine sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; moderate medium platy structure parting to fine granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (15 to 36 cm thick)

    E/B--31 to 46 cm; mixed light gray (10YR 7/2) and light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) heavy fine sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; primary peds are hard; few glossy patches on the more clayey peds; 5 percent pebbles and cobbles; this horizon consists of seams and nodules of material like that of the underlying horizon embedded in a light colored matrix like that of the overlying horizon; slightly acid (pH 6.2); diffuse wavy boundary.  (10 to 20 cm thick)

    Bt--46 to 76 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely gravelly sandy clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; peds are very hard; thin wax-like patches of faces of peds; wax-like coatings and fillings in root channels and pores; wax-like coatings on the underside of rock fragments and bridging between sand grains; 60 percent pebbles and cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); diffuse wavy boundary.  (20 to 75 cm thick)

    BC--76 to 86 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely gravelly light sandy clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; peds are hard; few glossy patches on faces of peds; some wax-like coatings on the underside of rock fragments and as bridging between sand grains; 60 percent pebbles and cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); diffuse wavy boundary.  (0 to 15 cm thick)

    2C--86 to 157 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely gravelly sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; single grained; loose; 70 percent pebbles and cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4).
