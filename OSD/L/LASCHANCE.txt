LASCHANCE SERIES

The Laschance series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in colluvium derived from dolomite, limestone, and calcareous sandstone. Laschance soils are on mountain slopes and hill slopes. Slopes range from 8 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 456 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 4.4 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Haploxerolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Laschance gravelly loam, 68 percent slope, northwest aspect, in rangeland at 1,886 meters. (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

 Bk1--22 to 28 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and common fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; very slightly effervescent; common fine and medium secondary calcium carbonate coats on the bottoms of rock fragments; 5 percent fine gravel, 30 percent medium and coarse gravel, and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt irregular boundary. (6 to 25 cm thick) 

 Bk2--28 to 39 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely cobbly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; slightly effervescent; common fine and medium secondary calcium carbonate coats around rock fragments; 30 percent medium and coarse gravel, 50 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 11 cm thick)

 R--39 cm; dolomite bedrock.
