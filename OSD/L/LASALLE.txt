LASALLE SERIES

The Lasalle series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable, soils that formed in calcareous, saline, clayey residuum.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on interfluves of inland, dissected coastal plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained. Runoff is slow to medium. Permeability is very slow.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mostly as rangeland, however, a few cultivated areas occur.  Grain sorghum, small grain, and perennial introduced grasses are grown in the cultivated areas.  Native vegetation includes grasses such as curly mesquite grass, plains bristlegrass, lovegrass tridens, pink pappusgrass, white tridens and threeawn.  Woody plants include running mesquite, upright mesquite, twisted acacia, lotebush, condalia, guyacan, spiny hackberry, prickley pear cactus, and dwarf screwbean.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  LRR I; Western Rio Grande Plain, Texas; LRR I; MLRA 83B; moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  La Salle County, Texas; 1978.  The name is coined from the county's name.

REMARKS:  These soils were formerly included in the Viboras series. The series was separated based on it is more moist and will support nonirrigated crops.  This soil would have been classified in the Grumusol great soil group.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 24 inches.

Vertic features: The presence of slickensides and wedge-shaped aggregates at 61 to 183 cm (24 to 72 in). (Bnyssz1, Bnyssz2, BCnyssz horizons)

ADDITIONAL DATA: Local lab data available pedons from McMullen County.
