LORAY SERIES

The Loray series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess.  Loray soils are on beach plains, offshore bars and fan skirts. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Typic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Loray gravelly loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is partially covered with 50 percent gravel.

(13 to 100 cm thick)

     2Ck2--119 to 155 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) extremely gravelly coarse sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 65 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; few distinct secondary calcium carbonate coats on the bottom of rock fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Aysees and Oljeto series. 

The Aysees soils are moist for 10 to 20 days in the summer, and also have 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Oljeto soils have a hue of 2.5YR.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Loray soils are on beach plains, offshore bars and fan skirts. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 1,310 to 1,955 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 130 to 200 mm; mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C; and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Laup, Piltdown and Shuttle series.  Laup soils have a continuous strong lime cementation.  Piltdown soils lack rock fragments.  Shuttle soils lack rock fragments and are weakly silica-lime cemented.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat excessively drained, low to medium runoff, moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly shadscale, bud sagebrush, Indian ricegrass and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeast Nevada and Southern Idaho.  MLRA 28A.  These soils are not extensive.
