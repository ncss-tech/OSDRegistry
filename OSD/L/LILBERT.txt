MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Nacogdoches County, Texas, 1976, Nacogdoches county soil survey area, Texas, 1976. The name is from a nearby community.

REMARKS:  The series was formerly included in the Fuquay series.  The series was separated based on absence of a kandic horizon.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle size control section: 61 to 111 cm (24 to 44 in.) (Bt, Btv, Btv/E1 horizon) 

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 61 cm (0 to 24 in).  (A and E horizons) 

Argillic horizon: 61 to 203 cm (24 to 80 in).  (Bt, Btv, Btv/E, Bt/E, and BtC horizons)

Plinthite (5 percent or more): 79 to 147 cm (31 to 58 in).  (Btv and Btv/E horizons)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data number S86TX-423-005 from Smith County, Texas.

ADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL Data from type location S86TX-423-005.  Particle-size analysis were performed at the project office on six pedons.  Base saturation analysis were performed at the project office on 69 pedons.
