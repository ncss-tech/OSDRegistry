LAYOINT SERIES

The Layoint series consists of moderately deep, somewhat execessively drained soils that formed in eolian deposits and residuum derived from sandstone.  Layoint soils are on rolling dissected plateaus.  Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, frigid Torriorthentic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Layoint loamy fine sand in rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  

    A1--0 to 1 inch; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) loamy fine sand, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 3 inches thick)

    A2--1 to 4 inches; reddish gray (5YR 5/2) loamy fine sand, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) moist; weak medium granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 5 inches thick)

    A3--4 to 8 inches; reddish gray (5YR 5/2) loamy fine sand, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)

    AB--8 to 14 inches; reddish gray (5YR 5/2) loamy fine sand, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 7 inches thick)

    Bw1--14 to 24 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) loamy fine sand, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary. (7 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw2--24 to 32 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) loamy fine sand, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable; slightly sticky and nonplastic; 10 percent pebbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (6 to 9 inches thick)

    R--32 inches; hard reddish yellow noncalcareous sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION:  Moffat County, Colorado, about 11 miles northeast of Dinosaur, Colorado; 2,000 feet north and 1,100 feet east of the southwest corner of Sec. 27, T. 5 N., R. 102 W.;  Lazy Y Point USGS quad; Lat. 40 degrees, 21 minutes, 13 seconds N.; long. 108 degrees, 50 minutes, 53 seconds W., NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture:  Ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
Mean annual soil temperature:  42 to 44 degrees F
Mean annual summer soil temperature:  61 to 65 degrees F
Depth to lithic contact:  20 to 40 inches to hard noncalcareous sandstone.
Thickness of the mollic epipedon:  8 to 15 inches
Particle-size control section (weighted average):  
Clay content:  5 to 10 percent
Sand content:  75 to 85 percent with 45 to 60 percent fine and medium sand and less than 50 percent very fine sand 
Rock fragments:  0 to 10 percent pebbles

A horizon:
Hue:  5YR or 7.5YR
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma:  2 or 3
Reaction:  neutral or slightly alkaline

Bw horizon:
Hue:  5YR or 7.5YR

COMPETING SERIES:  These are currently no competing series.   

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  eolian sands and residuum derived from sandstone
Landform:  rolling dissected plateaus
Slopes:  1 to 20 percent
Elevation:  7,300 to 8,000 feet
Mean annual temperature:  40 to 45 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation:  13 to 15 inches
Precipitation pattern:  precipitation is relatively evenly distributed throughout the year
Frost-free period:  75 to 95 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Moosed, Berlake, and Emlin series.  The Moosed soils are shallow.  The Berlake soils do not have bedrock less than 40 inches and are fine-loamy.  The Emlin soils do not have bedrock less than 40 inches, are fine-loamy, and have a calcic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  somewhat excessively drained, very low to low runoff, moderately rapid or rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for livestock grazing, recreation, and wildlife habitat.  Potential native vegetation is mountain big sage, antelope bitterbrush, needleandthread, western wheatgrass, and Sandberg bluegrass.
