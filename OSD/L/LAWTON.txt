LAWTON SERIES

The Lawton series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy material weathered from old alluvium from granitic material and associated mixed rocks.  These nearly level to sloping soils are on stream terraces and alluvial fans of the Wichita Mountains.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 27 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 62 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bexar, Frankirk, La Casa, Luckenbach, Rowden, Sagerton, and Swenson series.  None of these soils contain granitic gravels.
Bexar, Rowden, and Swenson: These soils are 20 to 40 inches deep over limestone bedrock.
Frankirk: These soils have secondary carbonate between 29 and 48 inches and do not allow gravelly textures.
La Casa, Luckenbach, and Sagerton: These soils have secondary carbonates within 30 inches of the surface.  In addition, La Casa and Sagerton soils contain a calcic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: Loamy alluvium that contains variable amounts of gravel derived from granite and associated mixed rocks.
Landform: Treads and risers of stream terraces that drain away from the Wichita Mountains and alluvial fans of the Wichita Mountains.
Slope: 0 to 8 percent
Mean annual air temperature range: 60 to 64 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation range: 25 to 32 inches
Frost-free period: 205 to 230 days
Elevation: 1000 to 1800 feet
Thornthwaite annual P-E indices: 38 to 50

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brico, Foard, Hollister, Tillman, and Vernon series.
Brico: These soils occur on higher areas adjacent to the Wichita Mountains and are clayey-skeletal in the particle-size control section.
Foard and Hollister: These soils occur on slightly lower areas, have smectitic mineralogy and vertic properties. In addition, Foard soils contain a natric horizon.
Tillman: These soils occur on lower areas, do not decrease in clay content within 60 inches, and do not contain gravelly textures.
Vernon: These soils occur on higher and lower side slopes and are 20 to 40 inches deep over Permian age shale or claystone bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained. moderately slow permeability. Runoff is low on less than 1 percent slopes, medium on 1 to 5 percent slopes, and high on 5 to 8 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used for wheat or other small grains.  Some areas are in cotton, sorghums and alfalfa.  Native vegetation consists of tall and mid grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Oklahoma; MLRA 82B  Wichita Mountains; Moderate extent.
