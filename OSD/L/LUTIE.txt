LUTIE SERIES

The Lutie series consists  of deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils.  The soil formed in loamy sediments.  These soils are on gently sloping to sloping uplands.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, thermic Calcidic Paleustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lutie silt loam - grassland.
(Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

A--0 to 11 inches, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) silt loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine granular structure; hard, friable; common very fine roots and pores; common wormcasts; calcareous, violently effervescent, moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (11 to 14 inches thick)

Bk--11 to 16 inches, reddish brown (2.5YR 5/4) silty clay loam, reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine granular and subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; few very fine roots and pores; patchy clay films on ped faces; 5 percent by volume weakly cemented calcium carbonate concretions; coatings and soft bodies of calcium carbonate; 35 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; calcareous, violently effervescent, moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 7inches thick)

Btk1--16 to 30 inches, red (2.5YR 5/6) silty clay loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; few very fine roots and pores; thin patchy clay films on ped faces; few gray bodies of very fine sandy loam; 3 percent by volume weakly cemented concretions, coatings, and soft bodies of calcium carbonate; 28 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; calcareous, violently effervescent, moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (10 to 29 inches thick).

Btk2--30 to 50 inches, red (2.5YR 5/6) silt loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; most peds have thin continuous clay films; about 10 percent of mass is made up of gypsum and gray and red very fine sandy loam pockets; calcium carbonate coatings on ped surfaces; 18 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; calcareous, violently effervescent, moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (15 to 40 inches thick)

Btk3--50 to 80 inches, red (2.5YR 5/6) silty clay loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; moderate medium blocky structure; very hard, firm; thin patchy clay films on most ped faces; few calcium carbonate coatings; about 6 percent by volume of gray siltstone; few pockets of red very fine sandy loam; 25 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; calcareous, violently effervescent, moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Wheeler County, Texas; north side of road 2.2 miles east via county road from its intersection with Farm Market 1547, this intersection is 3 miles north of the community of Lela which is 5 miles west of Shamrock.  The location is 0.2 mile east of the SW corner of sec.  87, Block 17, H&GN RR survey.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  These soils have accumulations of calcium carbonate and calcic horizons at depths of 10 to 24 inches.

The A horizon ranges from reddish brown (5YR 5/3, 4/3), brown (7.5YR 5/2, 5/3, 4/2, 4/3), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), through dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2).  The texture is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam. 

The Btk1 and Btk2 horizons range from red (2.5YR 5/6, 5/8), light red (2.5YR 6/6, 6/8), light reddish brown (5YR 6/4, reddish brown (5YR 5/4), reddish yellow (5YR 6/6, 6/8) through yellowish red (5YR 5/6, 5/8).  The texture of the Btk1 horizon is silty clay loam.  Content of clay ranges from about 27 to 35 percent.  The Btk2 horizon is silt loam to silty clay loam.

The Btk3 horizon ranges from light red (2.5YR 6/6, 6/8), red (2.5YR 5/6, 5/8), reddish yellow (5YR 6/6, 6/8), through yellowish red (5YR 5/6, 5/8).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing soils in the same family.  Similar soils are the Acuff, Carey, Estacado, Mansker, Pond Creek, Posey, Quanah and St. Paul series.
Acuff series: have Bt horizons with textures of sandy clay loam and calcic horizons below 30 inches.
Carey series: lack calcic horizons within 24 inches.
Estacado and Posey series: have fine-loamy particle-size control sections, and in addition Posey soils do not have mollic epipedons.
Mansker series: has carbonatic mineralogy, are less silty and lack evident clay accumulations in the upper Bt horizons.
Pond Creek and St. Paul serie: have mollic epipedons thicker than 20 inches.  Quanah series: do not have argillic horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lutie soils are on nearly level to sloping uplands convex surfaces.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent, but are dominantly 1 to 5 percent.  The regolith is loamy materials.  The climate is dry-subhumid.  Mean annual precipitation is 22 to 26 inches and the Thornthwaite annual P-E index is 32 to 38.  At the type location the annual P-E index is 36 and the mean annual air temperature is 61 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the similar Carey series and the Obaro, Quinlan, and Vernon series.  Obaro, Quinlan, and Vernon soils lack mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is negligible on 0 to 1 percetn slopes, low on 1 to 5 percent slopes and moderate on 5 to 8 percent slopes.  Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly rangeland.  Some is used for crops of grain sorghum, cotton, and wheat.  Native vegetation is mostly sideoats grama and blue grama with smaller amounts of buffalograss.  There are a few scattered
mesquite and other woody species.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwest Texas and southwest Oklahoma.  The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Collingsworth County, Texas; 1966.

REMARKS:  The Lutie soils were formerly included in the Weymouth and Woodward series.  Classification was updated due to changes in Soil Taxonomy and the competing series section was updated to the current classification.(3-20-01 WMR)

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - 0 to 11 inches.  (A-hoizon)
