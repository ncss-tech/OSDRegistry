LABUCK SERIES

The Labuck series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from granodiorite with an influence of ash and loess in the surface. Labuck soils are on hillslopes of uplands and have slopes of 5 to 35 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, isotic, frigid Vitrandic Haploxerepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Labuck loam, forested. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 3 cm; pine needles and twigs.

    A--3 to 18 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak fine granular and weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 10 percent fine gravel, 2 to 6 mm in diameter; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual wavy boundary. (13 to 25 cm thick)

    Bw1--18 to 38 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 10 percent fine gravel, 2 to 6 mm in diameter; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual wavy boundary. (18 to 41 cm thick)

    Bw2--38 to 56 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 20 percent fine gravel, 2 to 6 mm in diameter; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary. (18 to 36 cm thick)

    C--56 to 81; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; massive; hard, friable, 36 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 30 cm thick)

    Cr--81 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) partially decomposed granodiorite, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) dry.
