LITTLEAILIE SERIES

The Littleailie series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff. Littleailie soils are on eroded fan remnants and ballenas. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

Lapon soils have lithic contacts at depths between 38 and 100 cm, directly below the duripan.  Malmesa soils have lithic contacts at depths between 36 and 50 cm. Troughs and Vinini soils have lithic contacts at depths between 50 and 100 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Littleailie soils are on eroded fan remnants and ballenas. These soils formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and reworked lacustrine deposits. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The elevation ranges from 1,372 to 2,210 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual air temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Lojet and Qwynn soils. Lojet soils are moderately deep to a duripan. Qwynn soils do not have duripans.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Littleailie soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Potential native vegetation includes black sagebrush, Indian ricegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, and Nevada ephedra. This pedon is correlated to R029XY081NV, Shallow Calcareous Hill 10-14 P.Z.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Nevada. These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 29 and 28A.
