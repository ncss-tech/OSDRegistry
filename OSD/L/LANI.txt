LANI SERIES

The Lani series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed volcanic ash over colluvium and residuum from granite, gneiss, and schist. Lani soils are on backslopes and ridges of glaciated mountains. Slope ranges from 0 to 65 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, isotic, frigid Vitrandic Haploxerolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Lani ashy sandy loam, 0 to 25 percent slopes, at 1,800 to 3,700 feet elevation in a Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine forest. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. All textures are apparent field textures.)

        Oe--0 to 1 inch; moderately decomposed needles, twigs, and dry grass. 

        A1--1 to 8 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) ashy sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak thin platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt smooth boundary. 

        A2--8 to 14 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) ashy sandy loam, very dark grayish brown 10YR 3/2) moist; weak, fine, subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary. (combined thickness of A horizon is 10 to 20 inches) 

        2Bw--14 to 28 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots; common very fine and fine pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 35 inches thick) 

        2C--28 to 61 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine pores; 20 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4). 

TYPE LOCATION: Okanogan County; Chilwist Valley Quadrangle; SW1/4, NW1/4,SE1/4 section 15, T. 32 N., R. 24 E. (Latitude 48 Degrees, 16 minutes 15 seconds north., Longitude 119 degrees, 49 minutes, 9 seconds west. NAD83) 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
 
Soil moisture: usually moist, but are dry in all parts for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice; xeric soil moisture regime.
Soil temperature: mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F. 
Rock fragments: averages 15 to 35 percent in the particle-size control section. Some pedons contain some rounded glacial fragments 
Depth to bedrock: greater than 60 inches. 
Vitrandic properties: the upper 7 to 15 inches of the solum has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.20 to 1.40 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples. 
Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline throughout the profile. 
Sand content: averages 25 to 35 percent coarse and very coarse sand in the particle-size control section 
Thickness of mollic epipedon: 10 to 20 inches 
Base saturation (ultic): less than 75 percent in some part above the 30 inch depth.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bunchpoint, Dinkelman, Kilmerque, Lostcreek, Republic and Thrapp series. Lostcreek soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days, 5 to 25 percent rock fragments and less than 25 percent coarse and very coarse sand. Republic soils average 15 to 25 percent coarse plus very coarse sand in the particle-size control section, and 5 to 35 percent rounded rock fragments. Bunchpoint soils are 20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact. Kilmerque soils are 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact. Dinkelman soils are 40 to 60 inches to a paralithic contact. Thrapp soils are 36 to 45 inches to a densic contact. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lani soils are on backslopes and ridges of glaciated mountain and most have north or east aspect. Slope ranges from 0 to 65 percent. Lani soils formed in mixed volcanic ash over material weathered from granitic rock. Elevations are 1,800 to 3,700 feet. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 18 inches. The mean January temperature is about 24 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 65 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F. The frost-free season is 100 to 120 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bisping, Centralpeak, Dragoon, McCree, Morical, Nevine, Palmich, Spokane, Switchback, and Tyee soils. Bisping, McCree, Nevine, and Palmich soils have more than 60 percent pyroclastic materials. Centralpeak and Spokane soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Dragoon and Morical soils have an argillic horizon and are 20 to 40 inches deep. Switchback soils lack a mollic epipedon. Tyee soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 10 to 20 inches. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to very rapid runoff; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for grazing, timber production, nonirrigated hay and pasture, watershed, recreation, and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine with an understory of bluebunch wheatgrass, antelope bitterbrush, pinegrass, rose, arrowleaf balsamroot, Saskatoon serviceberry, white spirea, and common snowberry. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North central Washington; MLRA 6. The series is of moderate extent.
