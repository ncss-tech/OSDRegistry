LACRESCENT SERIES

The Lacrescent series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in 12 to 50 centimeters of loess or a mixture of loess and loamy colluvium and in loamy-skeletal colluvial sediments from bedrock.  Lacrescent soils are on convex slopes on steep and very steep hill slopes in dissected uplands.  Slope ranges from 5 to 90 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 977 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Lacrescent cobbly silty clay loam, on a southeast-facing, convex slope of 55 percent, in a mixed hardwood forest. (Colors are for moist soils unless otherwise stated.)

(20 to 36 centimeters thick) 

 AB--25 to 43 centimeters; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) cobbly silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; few small masses of black (10YR 2/1) and brown (10YR 4/3) material; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; common very fine to medium tree roots; about 25 percent cobblestones and pebbles; neutral; clear wavy boundary. (0 to 25 centimeters thick) 

 Bw--43 to 71 centimeters; brown (10YR 4/3) very cobbly silt loam, few small masses of very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) material; weak fine subangular blocky; structure; very friable; few fine and medium tree roots; about 50 percent cobblestones and pebbles; neutral; clear smooth boundary.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Houston County, Minnesota, 1981. 

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons or features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 43 centimeters (A and AB horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 43 to 71 centimeters;
udic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

Taxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, tenth edition, 2006.

Many of these soils were previously mapped as a miscellaneous land type called steep stony and rocky land. 

The bedrock is Oneota dolomite or Jordan sandstone but some pedons are underlain by the Platteville and St. Lawrence dolomite and St. Peter and Franconia sandstone formations. 2/18/2011-TYPE LOCATION error was corrected.
