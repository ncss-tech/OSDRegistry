LUTZCAN SERIES

The Lutzcan series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from sandstone.  Lutzcan soils are on hill and mountain side slopes and shoulders.  Slopes range from 20 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic, shallow Aridic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lutzcan very cobbly sandy clay loam - rangeland (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 2 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) very cobbly sandy clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few medium roots; common very fine irregular and few fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel, 30 percent cobble; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 6.8), abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 4 inches thick)

    Bt1--2 to 9 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) very cobbly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and few fine to coarse roots; common very fine irregular and few very fine and fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 10 percent gravel, 30 percent cobble; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 7 inches thick)

    Bt2--9 to 18 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very cobbly clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine to coarse roots; few very fine irregular and common very fine and fine tubular pores; common faint and few distinct clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 10 percent gravel, 30 percent cobble; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (7 to 9 inches thick)

    Cr--18 inches; weathered sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION:  Coronado National Memorial; located at a latitude of 31 degrees, 21 minutes, 10 seconds North and longitude of 110 degrees, 13 minutes, 7 seconds West.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture:  Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July - September and December - February.  Driest during May and June.  Aridic ustic soil moisture regime.

Soil Temperature:  59 to 64 degrees F.

Rock fragments:  averages 40 to 60 percent

Depth to weathered bedrock:  14 to 20 inches

Organic matter:  averages 1 to 3 percent

Clay content:  averages 18 to 35 percent

A horizon
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 2.5 or 3 moist
Chroma:  2 or 3, dry or moist

Bt horizons
Hue: 7.5YR, 5YR
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma:  2 through 4, dry or moist

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lutzcan soils are on hill and mountain side slopes and shoulders at elevations of 4,320 to 6,000 feet.  Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from sandstone.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 23 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December and January.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 65 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 210 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Yarbam soil.  Yarbam soils are formed in calcareous parent material and have a calcium carbonate equivalent of 20 to 40 percent.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate runoff;  moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation includes Lehmann lovegrass, plains lovegrass, false mesquite, sideoats grama, cane beardgrass, Palmer agave, prickly pear, cholla, and ocotillo.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Arizona.  Lutzcan soils are of limited extent.  MLRA is 38 & 41.  The name is derived from Lutz Canyon near the survey area.
