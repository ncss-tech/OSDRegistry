LAZBUDDIE SERIES

The Lazbuddie series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous, clayey lacustrine deposits of Quaternary age. These nearly level soils are on playa steps in large playa basins. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 483 mm (19 in) and mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (61 F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, thermic Calcic Haplusterts

TYPICAL PEDON: Lazbuddie clay, midway on a playa step, slightly concave, 0.4 percent slope in cropland at an elevation of about 1,175 m (3,854 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: An ustic moisture regime bordering on typic. The soil moisture control section is dry in some or all parts for more than 180 but less than 205 cumulative days in normal years. July through August and November through March are the driest months. These soils are intermittently moist in September through October and April through June; however, lower landscape positions result in higher "effective" precipitation. 
Mean annual soil temperature: 15 to 18 degrees C (59 to 64 F). 
Depth to secondary calcium carbonate: 13 to 100 cm (5 to 40 in). 
Depth to calcic horizon: 100 to 150 cm (40 to 60 in). 
Depth to slickensides: 6 to 25 cm (2 to 10 in). 
Linear extensibility of top 1 meter (40 in): 7 to 10 cm (2.75 to 4 in). 
Solum thickness: more than 203 cm (80 in). 
Particle-size control section (weighted average): 40 to 60 percent silicate clay. 
This is a cyclic soil and undisturbed areas have gilgai microrelief with microhighs 13 to 46 cm (5 to 18 in) higher than microlows. Distance between the center of the microhigh and the center of the microlow is about 1.5 to 6 m (5 to 20 ft). The microhigh makes up about 25 percent, the intermediate area between the high and low about 50 percent, and the microlow about 25 percent. Cracks open and close each year, except during higher than normal rainfall years, and remain open for 150 to 210 cumulative days during most years. When dry, 1.3 to 7.5 cm (0.5 to 3 in) wide cracks extends from the surface to a depth of 100 cm (40 in) or more. Cracks are more prominent in the microlow. The range in characteristics represents 50 percent or more of each pedon unless otherwise stated.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the similar Lockney, McLean, Randall, Ranco, and Sparenberg series and also the Arch, Drake, Estacado, Lofton, Pep, and Portales series. 
Lockney and Lofton soils: are on similar playa step landscape positions. 
McLean, Randall, Ranco, and Sparenberg soils: are on the floor of playa basins.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. Very slow permeability. Surface runoff is negligible on concave slopes of less than 1 percent. Ponding is occasional for very brief periods during some years.
USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for livestock grazing. Some areas are cultivated to wheat, cotton, or grain sorghum. Vegetation varies according to amount of water available. Native vegetation includes buffalograss, blue grama, vine mesquite, and western wheatgrass. This soil has been correlated to the Deep Hardland (R077CY022TX) ecological site in MLRA-77C.
