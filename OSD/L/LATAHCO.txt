LATAHCO SERIES 

The Latahco series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from the surrounding loessal uplands. Latahco soils are on low terraces, flood plains and drainageways. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Latahco soils are on low terraces, flood plains, and drainageways associated with loess covered uplands. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. The soils formed in alluvium from the surrounding loessal uplands. Elevation is 1,600 to 4,200 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 35 inches. The frost-free period is 80 to 135 days.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 46 degrees F. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cald, Lovell, Southwick and Thatuna soils. Cald soils lack albic and argillic horizons. Lovell soils have an ochric epipedon.  Southwick soils have fragic properties in the lower part of the profile are moderately well drained with oxyaquic conditions and lack redox features.  Thatuna soils lack redox depletions within the upper 30 inches and are dry for 60 to 80 consecutive days in late summer and early fall.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the surface and moderately low in the subsurface. Occasional, brief flooding occurs from February to April. Typically a perched water table is present from December through June. An apparent water table is also present. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for cropland. Crops are wheat, barley, hay, pasture, and grass seed. Native vegetation includes perennial forbs and grasses, black hawthorn, common chokecherry, and ponderosa pine. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Idaho, MLRA 9. The series is of moderate extent.
