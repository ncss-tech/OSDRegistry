LOLEKAA SERIES

The Lolekaa series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium.  Lolekaa soils are on terraces and fans and have slopes of 3 to 70 percent.  The median annual rainfall is about 80 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Very-fine, parasesquic, isohyperthermic Typic Palehumults

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lolekaa silty clay - pasture.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.  All textures are "apparent field textures".)

    Ap--0 to 10 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) silty clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) dry; strong very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; many very fine hard earthy lumps; very strongly acid (pH 4.5); abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to 10 inches thick)

    BA--10 to 15 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) silty clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) dry; moderate very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; compact in place; few fine roots; many very fine, fine and medium tubular pores; continuous thick coatings on peds; evidence of much worm activity; many hard earthy lumps; common soft strongly weathered pebbles that are distinctly yellower than matrix and smeary when rubbed; strongly acid (pH 5.1); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt1--15 to 22 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) silty clay, brown (10YR 4/3) dry; strong very fine, fine and medium angular and subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; compact in place; few fine roots; many very fine, fine and medium tubular pores; continuous thick clay films on peds and in pores, brown (7.5YR 4/4) continuous thick clay films in pores; many hard earthy lumps; strongly acid (pH 5.2); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt2--22 to 33 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) silty clay, brown (10YR 4/3) dry; strong medium subangular blocky and strong very fine and fine angular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; very compact in place; few fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; continuous thick clay films on peds, brown (7.5YR 4/4) continuous thick clay films in pores; many hard earthy lumps; few highly weathered rock fragments; very strongly acid (pH 4.9); clear wavy boundary.  (9 to 18 inches thick)

    Bt3--33 to 42 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) silty clay; dark brown(10YR 4/3) dry; strong very fine and fine angular blocky and subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; compact in place; few fine roots; many fine and very fine tubular pores; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) continuous thin clay films on peds, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) continuous thick clay films in pores; 5 percent highly weathered soft rock fragments that are yellower than the matrix and smeary when rubbed; very strongly acid (pH 4.8); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt4--42 to 55 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; moderate very fine and fine subangular block structure; hard friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; compact in place; few fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) continuous thin clay films on peds, dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) continuous thick clay films in pores; few rock fragments; very strongly acid (pH 4.8); clear smooth boundary.  (13 to 15 inches thick)

    Bt5--55 to 65 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) paragravelly loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; weak very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) thin continuous clay films on peds and in pores; 20 to 25 percent weathered rock fragments that are less weathered than those in layer above; very strongly acid (pH 4.7).

TYPE LOCATION: Island of Oahu, Honolulu County, Hawaii; near State Hospital at Kaneohe, on Federal Highway 83, west on Keaahala Road toward hospital, about 2,400 feet to the east hospital boundary, then northwest 600 feet, about 40 feet east of State Hospital boundary; Kaneohe Quadrangle; lat. 21 degrees 24 minutes 57 seconds N. and long. 157 degrees 48 minutes 43 seconds W. (Old Hawaiian Datum) 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Strongly weathered soft pebbles and stones range from none to many throughout the solum.  The solum is strongly or extremely acid.

The A horizon has value and chroma of 2 or 3 moist.

The Bt horizons have value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 through 6.  The Bt4 and Bt5 horizons range from loam to silty clay.

COMPETING SERIES:  (This needs updating.) These are the Kaneohe and Waikane series.  Kaneohe soils have 5YR or redder hue throughout and have thin patchy clay films in the argillic horizons.  Waikane soils have 7.5YR or redder hue and thin clay films in the argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lolekaa soils are on terraces and fans at elevations from near sea level to 500 feet.  Slopes range from 3 to 70 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium and colluvium from basic igneous rocks.  The median annual rainfall is 70 to 90 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F., mean January temperature is about 70 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is about 76 degrees F. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Alaeloa and the competing Waikane soils.  Alaeloa soils have 2.5YR or redder hue in the argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to rapid runoff depending on slope; permeability is moderately rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used primarily for pasture.  Small areas are used for growing truck crops and orchards.  Vegetation is californiagrass (Brachiaria mutica), hilograss (Paspalum conjugatum), ricegrass (Paspalum orbiculare), guava (Psidium guajava), christmasberry (Schinus terebinthifolius), and koa haole (Leucaena glauca).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Island of Oahu, Hawaii.  The series is of moderate extent comprising about 11,000 acres.
