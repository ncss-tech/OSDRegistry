LADOGA SERIES

The Ladoga series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loess.  These soils are on convex summits of interfluves, side slopes, and nose slopes on dissected till plains and treads and risers on stream terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 900 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Mollic Hapludalfs

(Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 66 to 135 centimeters.)

 C--130 to 152 centimeters; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam; massive; friable; many fine and medium faint olive gray (5Y 5/2) redoximorphic depletions; slightly acid.
