LYNCHLAKE SERIES 

The Lynchlake series consists of very deep, well drained soils on lake terraces and moraines. They formed in glaciolacustrine sediments or till with minor amounts of volcanic ash mixed in the surface layers. Permeability is moderately slow. Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. The average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is about 28 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:
Statemeadow (ID)  Has fragic soil characteristics; formed in reworked loess and material weathered from basalt.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform - lake terraces and moraines
Elevation - 3450 to 4200 feet. 
Slope - 2 to 30 percent. 
Parent material - volcanic ash over mixed glaciolacustrine sediments or till. 
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm, dry summers. 
Mean annual effective precipitation - 22 to 34 inches, much of which falls as snow and spring rain. 
Mean annual air temperature - 38 to 44 degrees F. 
Frost-free period - 70 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Half Moon, Tallcreek, Courville, and Rumblecreek soils. Half Moon soils are on similar positions and have less volcanic ash in the surface layers. Tallcreek soils are on similar positions, are coarse-silty, and do not have argillic horizons. Courville soils are on moraines, are loamy-skeletal, do not have argillic horizons, and formed in glacial till. Rumblecreek soils are on moraines, have less volcanic ash in the surface layer, are loamy-skeletal, and formed in glacial till.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderately slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Lynchlake soils are used mainly for timber production, woodland grazing, and as wildlife habitat. The potential native vegetation is coniferous forest consisting mainly of grand fir, lodgepole pine,  Engelmann spruce, Douglas-fir, and western larch with an understory of twinflower, queencup beadlily, bunchberry dogwood, dwarf huckleberry, pinegrass, kinnikinnick, common snowberry, white spirea, Oregon grape, and elk sedge.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Lynchlake soils are of limited extent in northwest Montana. MLRA 44A.
