LUCKYMINE SERIES

The Luckymine series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from phyllite, schist, and other metasedimentary rocks. The Luckymine soils are on hills. Slopes range from 8 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 800 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C.   

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, active, thermic, shallow Ultic Haploxeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Luckymine loam on a west-facing, linear, 8 percent slope under blue oak and annual grasses at an elevation of 369 meters.) Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted. When described on April 26, 2011 the soil was moist throughout).

(3 to 12 cm thick)   

 Bt1--4 to 23 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/4) gravelly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky parting to moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many very fine and common fine roots throughout; common very fine irregular and few medium tubular pores; 35 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds and 80 percent distinct clay films on rock fragments; 2 percent fine platy mica flakes in matrix; 10 percent subangular strongly cemented schist gravel, 10 percent subangular moderately cemented schist gravel, 10 percent subangular strongly cemented schist cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.9); clear smooth boundary. 

 Bt2--23 to 45 cm; strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) very cobbly loam, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, moderately sticky, slightly plastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots throughout; common very fine irregular pores; 25 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds and 80 percent distinct clay films on rock fragments; 2 percent fine platy mica flakes in matrix; 10 percent subangular strongly cemented schist gravel, 10 percent subangular moderately cemented schist gravel, 15 percent subangular strongly cemented schist cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.9); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 12 to 45 cm) 

 Crt--45 to 60 cm; Moderately cemented schist bedrock, fractured at intervals of 10 to less than 45 cm.      

 Rt--60 cm; Strongly cemented schist bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Swedesflat soils.  Swedesflat soils formed in residuum from intrusive igneous rocks, and do not have a lithic contact within the series control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Luckymine soils are on nose slopes and crests of hills in the Sierra Nevada foothills. Slopes range from 8 to 60 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from phyllite, schist, and other metasedimentary rocks. Elevation is 235 to 800 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 685 to 905 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 14 to 16 degrees C. The frost free season is 205 to 315 days.          

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hetchy, Millvilla, and Wardsferry soils. Hetchy and Millvilla soils are 50 to 100 centimeters deep to a paralithic contact and are on sideslopes of hills. Wardsferry soils are 100 to 150 centimeters deep to a paralithic contact and are on headslopes of hills.
