LINKUP SERIES

The Linkup series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basalt, andesite, rhyolite, welded tuffs, conglomerate shale, sandstone and quartzite.  Linkup soils are on summits or crests and side slopes of plateaus, hills and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, smectitic, frigid Lithic Xeric Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Linkup gravelly clay loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.)  The surface is partially covered with 15 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles.

    A1--0 to 8 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate thin platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; few medium, many fine and very fine vesicular pores; 5 percent cobbles, 15 percent gravel; moderately acid; (pH 6.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to 10 cm thick)

    A2--8 to 13 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common medium, many fine and very fine roots; few fine and very fine vesicular and interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 10 cm thick)

    Bt1--13 to 23 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/4) gravelly clay, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common medium and fine roots; common fine and very fine interstitial pores; many distinct clay films on faces of ped and lining pores; 5 percent cobbles, 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (10 to 18 cm thick)

    Bt2--23 to 43 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium and coarse prismatic structure parting to coarse and medium angular blocky; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few medium and fine roots; few very fine interstitial pores; continuous prominent clay films on faces of ped and lining pores, 5 percent cobbles, 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (13 to 20 cm thick)

    R--43 cm; rhyolite.

TYPE LOCATION:  Elko County Nevada, approximately 9 miles west of Midas; about 840 feet south and 2,100 feet west of the northeast corner of section 2, T. 46 N., R. 46 E.; USGS Star Valley Ridge East 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 41 degrees 55 minutes 10 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 47 minutes 44 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 41.9194444 latitude, -116.7955556 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in the winter and spring, dry mid-June through early November; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.
Depth to bedrock: 36 to 50 cm.
Reaction: Slightly acid through slightly alkaline, usually increasing with depth.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  Average 35 to 50 percent.
Sand content: 20 to 45 percent.
Rock fragments: 10 to 35 percent, mainly gravel and cobbles.

A horizon
Value: 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3.

Bt horizon
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR.
Value: 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma: 3 through 6.
Texture: Upper part; gravelly clay, clay loam, gravelly clay loam or cobbly clay loam with very cobbly clay loam common in some pedons. Lower part; clay, gravelly clay or cobbly clay.
Clay content: Upper part; 27 to 45 percent. Lower part; 40 to 55 percent.
Structure: Fine through coarse prismatic subangular blocky, or angular blocky.
Consistence: Hard or very hard dry.
Other features:  The lower Bt subhorizons of some pedons have carbonate coats on rock fragments.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Anawalt and Millerlux series.   

The Anawalt soils have an abrupt A/B textural boundary, less than 20 percent sand in the argillic horizon and lack clay loam textured Bt1 horizons. Millerlux soils have an abrupt E/B textural boundary and an E horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Linkup soils are on summits crests and side slopes of plateaus, hills and mountains. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basalt, andesite, rhyolite, conglomerate, shale, sandstone, welded tuffs and quartzite.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,825 to 2,445 meters.  The climate is cool semi-arid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm; mean annual air temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Alyan, Chen, Quarz, Roca and Vanwyper soils.  Alyan, Quarz, Roca and Vanwyper soils are more than 50 cm to bedrock.  Chen soils have a mollic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly low sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Thruber needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Nevada.  MLRA 25.  These soils are moderately extensive.
