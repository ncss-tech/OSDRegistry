LAPIN SERIES

The Lapin series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in till derived from granitic rocks. The Lapin soils are on ground moraines in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 5 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 650 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, isotic Vitrandic Cryorthents

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Evolution and Siberian soils. Evolution soils are greater than 150 cm to a densic contact and are moderately well drained. Siberian soils have a densic contact between 100 to 150 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Lapin soils are on linear to convex shoulders and backslopes of ground moraines in basins and on plateaus, and moraines on mountain slopes. Slopes range from 5 to 30 percent. These soils formed in till derived from granite and granodiorite. Elevation is 2570 to 3760 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 515 to 1365 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 0 to 5 degrees C. The frost free season is 50 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Siberian soils. The Siberian soils are on similar landscape positions and are greater than 150 cm to a densic contact.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity. Saturated hydraulic conductivity of the densic layer is moderately low to moderately high.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Vegetation is foxtail pine, whitebark pine, lodgepole pine, threadleaf sedge, and Parry's rush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. These soils are of limited extent.
