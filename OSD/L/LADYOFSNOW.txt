LADYOFSNOW SERIES

The Ladyofsnow series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from limestone and dolomite. Ladyofsnow soils are on upper backslopes of mountains. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 560 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ladyofsnow soils are on upper backslopes of mountains. Slope ranges from 30 to 75 percent. These soils formed in colluvium derived from limestone and dolomite. Elevations are 2743 to 3292 meters. The climate is sub-humid continental, cool, with moist winters and common summer thundershowers. The mean annual precipitation is 500 to 610 millimeters, the mean annual air temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 90 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Mountmummy and Robbersfire soils. Mountmummy soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Robbersfire soils are deep to bedrock and do not have a mollic epipedon. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; high runoff; moderately rapid permeability (high saturated hydraulic conductivity). 

USE AND VEGETATION: Ladyofsnow soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly Rocky Mountain bristlecone pine and currant. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave desert of southern Nevada. MLRA 30. These soils are not extensive with about 3,590 acres of the series mapped to date. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: PHOENIX, ARIZONA

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Clark County Area, Nevada, 2006. Proposed in  Clark County, Nevada; Clark County Soil Survey, 2004. The name is from Lady of Snows Camp located in the Spring Mountains. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 19 centimeters (Oi and E horizons).

Calcic horizon - The zone from 19 to 151 centimeters (2Bhkq, 2Bkq1, 2Bkq2, and 2Bkq3 horizons).

Particle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 centimeters (2Bkq1 and 2Bkq2 horizons and parts of the 2Bhkq and 2Bkq3 horizons). 

ADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has full characterization data by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as pedon ID S04NV-003-006 (pedon # 05N0124).
