LLANO SERIES

The Llano series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in gypsiferous lacustrine deposits. These nearly level soils are on relict lake beds. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 67 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Llano soils are on relict lakebeds on basin floors. Slope is 0 to 3 percent. These soils formed from gypsiferous lacustrine deposits. Elevation ranges from 3,890 to 3,990 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. Precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September. The mean annual air temperature is 64 to 70 degrees F. The frost-free period is 180 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the tentative Ratscat (NM), Mamtrack (NM) and Salago (NM) soils. Ratscat soils lack a petrogypsic horizon. Mamtrack soils lack a salic horizon, Salago soils have a water table at 20 inches.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low to medium runoff; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: The major uses are military exercises and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is iodine bush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South central New Mexico, limited to the Alkali Flat of the Tularosa Basin. MLRA 42, Llano is of limited extent.
