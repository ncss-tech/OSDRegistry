LAEWEST SERIES

The Laewest series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in clayey flood basin deposits on alluvial plains or deltas of the Beaumont Formation of Pleistocene Age. These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on broad flat coastal plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.5 degrees C (70.5 degrees F).

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
The solum thickness is more than 200 cm (80 in).
This is a cyclic soil and undisturbed areas have gilgai microrelief with microhighs 15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 in) higher than microlows.  Distance from the center of the microhighs to the center of the microlows ranges from about 1.2 to 4.9 m (4 to 16 ft).   The microhigh makes up about 20 percent, the intermediate, or area between the knoll and depression about 50 percent, and the microlow about 30 percent.
The amplitude of waviness between mollic colored materials in the upper part of the solum and the higher value colors in the lower part ranges from about 30 to 150 cm (12 to 60 in).  The chimneys of high value materials on microhighs make up 2 to 5 percent of the surface area.  They are mainly 0.6 to 2.4 m (2 to 8 ft) long and 0.2 to 0.6 m (1/2 to 2 ft) wide.
When dry, the soil has cracks 1 to 5 cm (about 1/2 to 2 in) wide at the surface and commonly 1 cm (1/2 inch) wide cracks extend to a depth of 1.2 m (4 ft) during the summer.  The cracks remain open for less than 90 cumulative days in most years.
Slickensides begin at a depth of 30 to 61 cm (12 to 24 in) and extend throughout the solum.  The angle of the slickensides ranges from about 10 to 65 degrees from horizontal and tend to be more vertical in microhighs than in microlows.
Some pedons have an overwash of calcareous clay or silty clay 20 to 51 cm (8 to 20 in) thick.

Soil Moisture: An udic soil moisture regime.  The soil moisture control section is not dry in some or all parts for as long as 90 cumulative days in normal years.  July and August are the driest months, while April through June and September through November is the wettest.

Mean annual soil temperature: 22.2 to 23.5 (72 to 74 degrees F).

Ganado soils: mollic colors to a depth greater than 100 cm (40 in) throughout the pedon.  
Lake Charles soils: less amplitude of waviness; are moist in the moisture control section for slightly longer periods; allow hue redder than 10YR in the lower horizon.  
Bacliff soils: have colors with value greater than 3 throughout; are moist in the moisture control section for slightly longer periods  
Pledger soils: have a very-fine particle-size control section.  
Victoria soils: are typically calcareous throughout; have cracks that remain open more than 90 days in most years.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: clayey fluviomarine deposits on relict flood plains or deltas of the Beaumont Formation of Pleistocene Age
Landscape: flat coastal plains
Landform: broad flats
Slope: dominantly less than 1 percent but range to 8 percent on side slopes of along drainageways
Mean annual air temperature range: 20.6 to 21.7 degrees C (69 to 71 degrees F).
Mean annual precipitation range: 914 to 1245 mm (36 to 49 in)
Precipitation Pattern: Precipitation falls mostly from April through December. January through March are the driest months.
Frost-free period: 275 to 300 days
Elevation: 3 to 48.8 m (10 to 160 ft)
Thornthwaite annual P-E indices: 46 to 60

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the competing Francitas (TX) series and the Bacliff (TX), Dacosta (TX), Edna (TX), and Faddin (TX) soils.  

Bacliff and Francitas soils: on lower slightly depressional landform.  
Dacosta soils: on a slightly lower or similar positions 
Edna and Faddin soils: are on similar positions.  In addition, Dacosta, Edna, and Faddin soils have loamy surface layers and argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Laewest soils are moderately well drained.  The permeability is very slow.  Water enters the soil rapidly when it is dry and cracked, but very slowly when the soil is wet and the cracks are sealed.  Runoff is high on 0 to 1 percent slopes and very high on slopes greater than 1 percent. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  The soil is used mainly for rangeland and cropland.   The most common crops grown are grain sorghum, corn, rice, and cotton.  Turf grasses are also grown.  Climax rangeland vegetation consists mainly of little bluestem, indiangrass, eastern gamagrass, switchgrass, big bluestem, and paspalums.  Trees include liveoak, elm, hackberry, huisache, and mesquite along fence rows, drainageways and in scattered motts. (Ecological site name: Blackland 24-44" PZ; Ecological site number: R150AY526TX)

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The Gulf Coast Prairies (MLRA 150A; LRR T) of Texas west of the Colorado River to about the central part of Refugio County.
