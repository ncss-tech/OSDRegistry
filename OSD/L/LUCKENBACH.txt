LUCKENBACH SERIES

The Luckenbach series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in ancient loamy or clayey alluvium. These nearly level and gently sloping soils are on alluvial plain remnants or stream terraces and along narrow valleys on dissected plateaus. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 660 ,mm (26 in) and mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C (65 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the competing Blanket, Heaton, Hensley, Krum, Pedernales, and Sunev series.
Blanket soils: Are on similar or slightly lower positions.
Heaton, Hensley, and Pedernales soils: Do not have mollic epipedons. Heaton and Hensley soils are typically on stream divides, low ridges, or nearby slopes.
Pedernales soils: Are on similar positions.
Krum soils: Have clayey surfaces, do not have argillic horizons, and are on similar positions.
Sunev soils: Have a calcic horizon, loamy subsoils, and are on footslopes. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: This soil is well drained. Permeability is moderately slow. Runoff is negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes, very low on 1 to 3 percent slopes, and low on 3 to 5 percent slopes. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Mostly in rangeland. The remainder is used for cropland, orchards or wildlife. The major crops are forage sorghums and small grains. The climax plant community is a tall grass prairie. The dominant grass is little bluestem. Other plants include sideoats grama, vine mesquite, yellow Indiangrass, big bluestem, Canada wildrye, live oak, silver bluestem, Texas wintergrass, cane bluestem, hairy wedelia, Texas cupgrass, tall dropseed, and plains lovegrass. The dominant forbs include Maximilian sunflower, Engelmann daisy, and bushsunflower. The woody plants include elm, live oak, hackberry, bumelia, green briar and elbowbush. The site could potentially deteriorate to a plant population of sideoats grama, Texas wintergrass, cane bluestem, and buffalograss. Continued heavy use causes further deterioration and plants such as tumblegrass, hairy tridens, Texas grama, red threeawn, western ragweed, broomweed, prairie coneflower, and Ashe juniper, will dominate the site. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Texas; Southwest Plateaus and Plains Range and Cotton Region, LRR-I: MLRA 81C-Edwards Plateau, Eastern Part; MLRA 81B-Edwards Plateau, Central Part; and MLRA 82A-Texas Central Basin. Southestwern Prairies Cotton and Forage Region, LRR-J: MLRA 85-Grand Prairie; and MLRA 87A-Texas Claypan Area, Southern Part. The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Gillespie County, Texas; 1970. 

REMARKS: Luckenbach soils were formerly in the Pedernales series which does not have a mollic epipedon. This soil was changed from a Typic Argiustoll to Udic Argiustoll in August 1989 because of change in Soil Taxonomy. However, most of the acreage and the typical pedon are located in the Typic Ustic moisture regime. Other areas are mainly on the Udic/Ustic and Typic/Ustic line. Therefore, we are classifying this soil in the Typic subgroup in 1990. NSSL lab data near the series type location in Gillespie County, Texas identified high shrink swell and slickensides suggesting a vertic subgroup.  Classification was not changed pending a study over the entire series extent.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 46 cm (0 to 18 in) (A horizons) 
Argillic horizon: 46 to 97 cm (18 to 38 in) (Bt horizons) 
Identifiable calcium carbonate: Secondary forms of calcium carbonate in all horizons below 76 cm (30 in).

ADDITIONAL DATA: Lab data available from the National Soil Survey Laboratory at type location on (pedon number: S09TX171002, sample numbers: 09N02891-09N02897.)
