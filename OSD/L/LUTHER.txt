LUTHER SERIES

The Luther series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in till. These soils are on slightly convex and nearly level glaciated uplands adjacent to major streams and their tributaries. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 740 millimeters.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 38 to 88 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 38 centimeters (A, E1, E2, and E3 horizons);
albic horizon--the zone from a depth of 10 to 38 centimeters (E1, E2, and E3 horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 38 to 91 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and Btg horizons);
aquic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
