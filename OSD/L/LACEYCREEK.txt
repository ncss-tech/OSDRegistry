LACEYCREEK SERIES

The Laceycreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans, drainageways, hills, and stream terraces.  Slopes are 2 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability above the 2BC horizon and moderately rapid through the 2BC horizon.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The Laceycreek soils are used mainly for rangeland and woodland.  Some areas are used for hayland and cropland.  The potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, rough fescue, Idaho fescue, and Columbia needlegrass.  The moist phase has an overstory of quaking aspen and the potential native understory vegetation is rose, snowberry, Saskatoon serviceberry, Canada wildrye, red raspberry, and sticky geranium.  The cool phase has an overstory of ponderosa pine and Douglas fir and the potential native understory vegetation is pinegrass, common snowberry, white spirea, rose, and kinnikinnick.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Laceycreek soils are of small extent in the Highwood and Bearpaw Mountains in central and north-central Montana.
