GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ahtell, Cirquecreek, and Stibnite series.
Ahtell soils are well drained, lack permafrost, have folistic and umbric epipedons, and occur on hill tops, and hillside positions.
Cirquecreek soils are well drained, lack a cambic horizon, and occur on saddles and mountain slopes
Stibnite soils are well drained, lack a lithologic discontinuity, and occur in till plains, mountains, kames and kettles.
