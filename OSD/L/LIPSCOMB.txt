LIPSCOMB SERIES

The Lipscomb series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in sandy eolian deposits derived from the Laverne Member, Ogallala Formation of Miocene-Pliocene age. These nearly level to moderately sloping soils occur on undulating to rolling dunes and sandsheets emplaced over hillslopes. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 584 mm (23 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 14.4 degrees C (58 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Aridic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lipscomb sandy loam--on a 2 percent convex slope in improved pasture at approximately 721 m (2365 ft) elevation.
