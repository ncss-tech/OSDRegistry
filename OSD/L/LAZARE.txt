LAZARE SERIES

The Lazare series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey lacustrine sediments of Pleistocene age. These nearly level and very gently sloping soils are on the floor and side slopes of small depressions in the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78). Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 610 mm (24 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 17 degrees C (63 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, thermic Udic Haplusterts

TYPICAL PEDON: Lazare silty clay, rangeland, midway between microhigh and microlow, 0.1 percent slope in playa basin at an elevation of about 553 meters (1750 feet). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil Moisture: An ustic soil moisture regime. The soil moisture control section is dry in some or all parts for more than 90 but less than 150 cumulative days in normal years. July through August and November through March are the driest months. Intermittently moist from September through October and April through June. These soils receive runoff from surrounding uplands and the soil moisture control section is moist for longer periods of time than is normal for the climate of the series province.
Mean annual soil temperature: 17 to 19 degrees C (63 to 66 degrees F)
Depth to secondary calcium carbonate: 15 to 61 cm (6 to 24 in)
Depth to slickensides: 15 to 36 cm (6 to 14 in)
Solum thickness: more than 203 cm (80 in)
Particle-size control section: 40 to 55 percent silicate clay.
This is a cyclic soil and undisturbed areas have gilgai microrelief with microhighs 15 to 51 cm (6 to 20 in) higher than microlows. Distance between the center of the microhigh and the center of the microlow is about 1 to 7 m (5 to 12 ft). The microhigh makes up about 25 percent, the intermediate, or area between the high and low, about 50 percent, and the microlow about 25 percent. Cracks open and close each year except during higher than normal rainfall years, and remain open for less than 150 cumulative days during most years. When dry, 1 to 3 inch wide cracks extend from the surface to a depth of 102 cm (40 inches) or more. Cracks are more prominent in the microlows. COLE is more than 0.07. The range in characteristics represents 50 percent or more of each pedon unless otherwise stated.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Abilene, Eastall, Hollister, La Casa, Kingco, Rotan, Rowena, Sagerton, and Westill series. 
Abilene, La Casa , Rotan, Sagerton, and Westill soils have an argillic horizon and are on higher well drained areas.
Eastall soils are on lower poorly drained areas where water ponds for long to very long periods in most years and have an aquic moisture regime.
Hollister and Kingco soils are on higher well drained areas.
Rowena soils have mixed mineralogy and are on higher well drained areas.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Very slow permeability. 
Surface runoff is negligible. Ponding frequency is occasional or frequent. 
Ponding duration is very brief or brief period in most years. Ponding for long to very long duration may occur but is unlikely in most years.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for livestock grazing with some areas used for crop production. Common vegetation includes buffalograss, vine mesquite, western wheatgrass, white tridens, and fall aster. Sedges and frog-fruit grow in some of the microdepressions. Stunted lotebush and mesquite grow on some of the microhighs. A few areas are cultivated to wheat, cotton, and sorghums. This soil has been correlated to the Lakebed (078BY078TX) range site in MLRA-78.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Rolling Red Plains, Western Part (MLRA 78B in LRR H) of northwestern Texas. The series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: MLRA-78 Soil Survey; Foard County, Texas; 2004. The name is from a nearby community in Hardeman County.

REMARKS: The Lazare series was formerly included in the Lipan, Roscoe, and Randall series.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon: 0 to 228 cm (0to 90 in). 
Vertic features: 30 to 175 cm (12 to 69 in)(Bss, Bkss horizons) wedge-shaped aggregates and slickensides.
