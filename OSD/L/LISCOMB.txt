LISCOMB SERIES

The Liscomb series consists of deep, well drained soils on lower portions of convex side slopes on uplands.  These moderately permeable soils formed in friable glacial till or 30 to 75 centimeters of silty or loamy sediments and the underlying firm glacial till.  The slopes are typically 9 to 18 percent, but range from 5 to 35 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 9 degrees C (48 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 890 millimeters (32 inches).

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Marshall County, Iowa, 1978.

REMARKS:  This soil occurs in the south border area of the Iowan erosion surface.  The redoximorphic features in the lower part of the B horizon are considered to be relict and not indicative of present drainage.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 41 centimeters (A1, A2, and Bw1 horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 41 to 107 centimeters (Bw1, Bw2, and BC horizons).

Ranges in Characteristics were edited based on available lab data during the Liscomb Soil Data Join Recorrelation Projects FY 2013.
