LYKAL SERIES

The Lykal series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Lykal soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lykal soils are on stream terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations range from 1,768 to 1,859 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the James Canyon and Wendane soils.  James Canyon soils are fine-loamy, poorly drained, and have thick mollic epipedons.  Wendane soils are fine-silty, have sodium adsorption ratio of 13 to 99 in the upper 50 cm, and horizons with durinodes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; high surface runoff; moderately high or high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 46 and 91 cm (shallow and moderately deep free water occurrence classes) between March and May.  Cumulative annual duration class is Transitory.  These soils are susceptible to rare flooding for very brief periods year-round.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Lykal soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly shrubby cinquefoil, purple reedgrass, and western wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive with about 1,300 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 28B.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Elko County (Southeast Part), Nevada, 1994.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (A1 and part of the A2 horizons).
Cambic horizon - The zone from 30 to 104 cm (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).
Endosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 46 and 91 cm at certain times during normal years (parts of the C2 horizon).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Bw1 and parts of the A2 and Bw2 horizons).

The revision of December 2007 updated the taxonomic class from Coarse-silty, carbonatic, mesic Aeric Fluvaquents based on the recognition of a cambic horizon and an aridic moisture regime.
