LOSTINE SERIES

The Lostine series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess and mixed alluvium including loess and volcanic ash. They are on outwash plains, terraces, fans, and swales on loess hills. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm. The mean annual air temperature is about 6.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Lostine silt loam, meadow. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted; when described in 8/94 the soil was dry throughout.)

	A1--0 to 5 cm; black (10YR 2/1) silt loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; moderate medium and fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common irregular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.

	A2--5 to 30 cm; black (10YR 2/1) silt loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and common fine roots; few fine and medium tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (The combined thickness of the A horizons is 28 to 64 cm.)

	Bw--30 to 58 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (23 to 110 cm thick)

	BC--58 to 119 cm; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silt loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) dry; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine and fine and few medium tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 61 cm thick)

	C1--119 to 152 cm; 75 percent brown (10YR 5/3) and 25 percent light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silt loam, 75 percent light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) and 25 percent very pale brown (10YR 8/4) dry; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary.(51 to 102 cm thick)

	C2--152 to 165 cm; variegated with matrix color brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 10 percent coarse gravel, and 35 percent fine gravel; neutral (pH 6.8).

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Sarilda series. Sarilda soils are 50 to 100 cm deep to bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
  Landscape: outwash plains, alluvial plains, and plateaus
  Landform: swales on loess hills, terraces, and fans
  Elevation: 914 to 2033 meters
  Slope: 0 to 30 percent
  Parent material: loess and mixed alluvium including loess and volcanic ash
  Mean annual air temperature: 2.2 to 7.2 degrees C.
  Mean annual precipitation: 305 to 559 mm
  Frost free period: 40 to 100 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Harlow, Josset, Minam, Powwatka, and Redmount soils.  Harlow soils are on adjacent hillslopes, are shallow to bedrock and clayey-skeletal.  Josset soils are on slightly lower floodplains and are coarse-loamy over sandy skeletal.  Minam soils are on slightly higher fans and are fine-loamy. Powwatka soils are on adjacent rolling hills, are moderately deep to bedrock and fine-silty.  Redmount soils are on slightly lower outwash plains and are coarse-loamy with silt loam over very gravelly sandy loam in the control section.
