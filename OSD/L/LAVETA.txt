LAVETA SERIES

The Laveta series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in sandy slope alluvium over residuum weathered from sandstone.  Laveta soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 3 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 1 to 9 inches.  (E horizon)
Argillic horizon:  The zone from 9 to 17 inches.  (Bt horizon)
Lithic contact:  The contact at 26 inches.  (R horizon)
The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
