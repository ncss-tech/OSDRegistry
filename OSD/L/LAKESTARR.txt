LAKESTARR SERIES

The Lakestarr series consists of deep to a densic layer, moderately well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and loess over colluvium weathered from pre-tertiary felsic gneiss and schist and local till. The Lakestarr soils are on mountain backslopes and foothills. Slope ranges from 8 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Hunsaker (T) and Floodwood series. Hunsaker and Floodwood soils are very deep and lack a densic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches. Similar soils are the Hildebrand (T), Jaype (T), and Konkol (T), series. Hildebrand, Jaype, and Konkol soils have mixed mineralogy and do not have densic materials in the lower part. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Lakestarr soils are on backslopes of dissected mountains and foothills. Slope ranges from 3 to 55 percent. The soils formed in volcanic ash and loess over colluvium weathered from pre-tertiary felsic gneiss and schist and local glacial till. Elevations are 2,600 to 3,600 feet. The climate is characterized by cool moist winters and warm dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 40 inches. The mean annual temperature is 41 to 44 degrees F. The frost-free period is 60 to 90 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Keeler, Kruse, and Santa soils. Keeler soils are fine-loamy with a surface mantle influenced by loess and volcanic ash, do not have densic materials in the lower part, and are on adjacent mountain slopes at higher positions. Kruse soils are fine-loamy, are xeric, and are on convex mountain slopes. Santa soils have a fragipan, are xeric, and are on convex positions of toeslopes. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: moderately well drained; moderately high over low saturated hydraulic conductivity. There is a perched water table at a depth of 15 to 40 inches from February to April. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for rural homesites, timber production, recreation, water supply and wildlife habitat. Potential natural vegetation is western hemlock, western redcedar, grand fir, Douglas-fir, western larch, lodgepole pine, Rocky Mountain maple, quaking aspen, thinleaf alder, creambush oceanspray, mallow ninebark, and thimbleberry, with an understory of bride's bonnet, Idaho goldthread, longtube twinflower, Piper's anemone, pyrola, Western rattlesnake plantain, oneleaf foamflower, darkwoods violet, and sweetcicely, 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Washington and possibly northern Idaho. MLRA 43A. The series is of small extent.
