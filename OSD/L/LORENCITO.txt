LORENCITO SERIES

The Lorencito series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from shale and siltstone.  Lorencito soils are on hills, pediments and structural benches.  Slopes range from 3 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Clayey, mixed, superactive, nonacid, mesic, shallow Aridic Ustorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lorencito channery clay loam, on a west facing, 25 percent slope in pinyon pine and juniper at an elevation of 6,300 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on March 9, 1971 the soil was moist from 0 to 13 inches.  The surface is covered by 25 percent channers.

     A--0 to 4 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) channery clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; hard, firm, sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; 30 percent channers; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)

    AC--4 to 16 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) parachannery clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure that parts to moderate fine subangular blocks; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine roots; 20 percent shale parafragments; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual smooth boundary.  (7 to 14 inches thick)

    Cr--16 to 26 inches; soft fractured interbedded shale and siltstone. 

TYPE LOCATION:  Las Animas County, Colorado; about 2.5 miles west of Cokedale, Colorado; located about 1,100 feet south and 2,450 feet east of the northwest corner of sec. 27, T. 32 S., R. 65 W.; Madrid USGS quad; lat. 37 degrees 8 minutes 49 seconds N. and long. 104 degrees 39 minutes 31 seconds W., NAD 1927

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Toldohn(NM) series. 
Toldohn soils:  are dry in May and June.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium and residuum derived from shale and siltstone, commonly the Raton Formation.
Landform:  hills, pediments, structural benches
Slopes:  3 to 65 percent
Elevation:  5,500 to 7,800 feet
Mean annual temperature:  46 to 52 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation:  15 to 18 inches
Precipitation pattern:  continental
    Wettest period: May through August
    Driest period: December through February
Frost-free period:  125 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Rombo, Sarcillo, and Trujillo series.  The Rombo soils are moderately deep to paralithic contact and are on north facing backslopes of hills.  The Sarcillo soils are shallow to lithic contact and are on summits and shoulders of hills.  The Trujillo soils are very deep and are on fans and drainageways.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, rapid runoff, slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat; the native vegetation is twoneedle pinyon, juniper, Gambel's oak, true mountainmahogany, sideoats grama, blue grama, western wheatgrass, and little bluestem.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Foothills of southeastern Colorado; LRR E, MLRA 49 and a small amount in 67; moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Las Animas County, Colorado, Las Animas Area soil survey area, Colorado, 2007.  The name was taken from a major canyon west of Trinidad, Colorado.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 16 inches.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 0 to 16 inches.  (A and AC horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 4 inches.  (A horizon)
Paralithic contact:  The contact with shale at 16 inches.  (Cr horizon)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
