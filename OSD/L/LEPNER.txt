LEPNER SERIES

The Lepner series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Natrustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Lepner gravelly loam, 2 percent slope in non-irrigated cropland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    E--0 to 6 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate very thin platy structure; hard, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; many light gray (10YR 7/2) silt and sand skeletans on faces of peds; 20 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 8 inches thick)

    Bt--6 to 15 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong medium columnar structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; continuous distinct dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist clay films on faces of peds; silt and sand skeletans on tops of columns; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual smooth boundary. (7 to 15 inches thick)

    Btkn--15 to 32 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silty clay, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; common faint coatings of lime; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); gradual smooth boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick)

    Bnyz--32 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 20 percent gravel; common fine seams and masses of gypsum and other salts; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).
