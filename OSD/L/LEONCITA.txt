LEONCITA SERIES

The Leoncita series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy alluvium of Pleistocene age. These nearly level to moderately sloping soils are on risers and treads of remnant paleoterraces. Slopes range from about 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm (25 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F).

the tuffaceous Catahoula Formation; allows clay loam, silty clay loam and silty clay in the surface horizon
Hidalgo soils: are moist for more than 90 days, consecutive, in normal years (typic-ustic moisture regime).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mostly for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Some areas are crop production, mostly for grain sorghum. Present vegetation includes pink pappusgrass, lovegrass tridens, fall witchgrass, hooded windmillgrass, and plains bristlegrass. Woody vegetation includes mesquite, catclaw, spiny hackberry, and blackbrush, and guallijo.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES PROPOSED:  McMullen County, Texas, 2010. The name is from a stream in McMullen County.

REMARKS:  The series was formerly included in the Hidalgo series.  The Hidalgo series parent material is associated with deltas and coastal terraces. The series was separated based on the source and age of the alluvium. Leoncita soils formed from inland calcareous loamy alluvium of Pleistocene age associated with remnant paleoterraces.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle size control section: 25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in).  (Ap2, Bk1, Bk2 horizon) 

Mollic epipedon: 0 to 28 cm (0 to 11 in).  (Ap horizons) 

Calcic horizon: 40 to 160 cm (11 to 63 in).  (Bk1, Bk2, and Bk3 horizons)

ADDITIONAL DATA: Local lab data was run on particle-size analysis, calcium carbonate equivalent and pH were at the project office on S08TX3117106. The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from Live Oak County, Texas on soils derived from similar sediments.
