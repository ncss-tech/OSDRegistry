LITTLEGRAY SERIES

The Littlegray series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess influenced slope alluvium over basalt. These soils are on hillslopes. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 525 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 2.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Xeric Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Littlegray loam in rangeland; (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; 2 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary. 

    BA--3 to 19 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; 2 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. 

    Bt1--19 to 38 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; 10 percent faint clay films on all faces of peds and clay bridges between sand grains; 2 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. 

    Bt2--38 to 56 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; 10 percent faint clay films on all faces of peds and clay bridges between sand grains; 10 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.6); abrupt irregular boundary. 

    R--56 cm; basalt
