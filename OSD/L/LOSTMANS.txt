GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  
Boca soils have argillic horizons, have bedrock at depths greater than 51 centimeters (20 inches), and occur on similar or slightly higher landform positions.
Chobee limestone substratum soils have argillic horizons, have bedrock at depths greater than 51 centimeters (20 inches), and occur on lower landform positions.
Copeland soils have mollic epipedons and argillic horizons, have bedrock at depths greater than 51 centimeters (20 inches), and occur on slightly lower landform positions.
Hallandale soils are sandy throughout, lack calcium carbonates, and occur on similar landform positions.
Rattlesnake Ridge soils have mollic epipedons, lack calcium carbonates, and occur in slightly higher landform positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:

Extent: limited

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE:  Auburn, Alabama.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Collier County, Florida; 2023.  

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:

1. Ochric epipedon - 0 to 8 centimeters (0 to 3 inches) (Ak horizon)
2. Lithic contact - 30 to 56 centimeters (12 to 20 inches) (2R horizon)
3. Aquic conditions - 0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches)
4. Endosaturation - 0 to 51 centimeters (0 to 20 inches)

The mineralogy of this soil is mixed due to 20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  However, the sand mineralogy is siliceous.  The carbonates are due to recharge from a fluctuating ground water table. These carbonates do not qualify for a Calcic horizon.

Soil classified according to the 12th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.

This soil was formerly recognized as Ochopee soils in the hyperthermic temperature regime.
