SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Distribution: Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. Extent: Low

SERIES ESTABLISHED: DeKalb County, Georgia; 1938.

REMARKS: 
Louisburg soils were formerly classified in the Lithosol great soil group. The July 1975 revision changed the series from a moderately deep Typic Dystrochrept to a very deep Ruptic Ultic Dystrochrept with variable depth to lithic or paralithic contact. The purpose was to describe a complex of Dytrochrepts and Hapludults. The series was little used after the 1975 revision as the Ashlar, Wateree and Rion soils were used for these complexes. This revision restores part of the concept of the Louisburg series for the very deep component that occurs in many or most of these map units. 05/07 BC added to RIC. (RHB) The September 2025 revision reformatted the description to semi-tabular. No data was changed.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches) (A and E horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 18 to 66 centimeters (7 to 26 inches) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).
