LACONNER SERIES

The Laconner series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in glacial drift with an admixture of volcanic ash over dense glacial till. These soils are on hillslopes of drift plains. Slopes are 0 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, isotic, mesic Aquic Haploxerepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Laconner gravelly sandy loam-forested. (Colors are moist soil unless otherwise noted. All textures are apparent field textures).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Laconner soils are on hillslopes of drift plains at elevations of 0 to 600 feet. They formed in mixed glacial drift with an admixture of volcanic ash over a dense glacial till. Slopes are 0 to 45 percent. These soils have a mild marine climate with cool dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 20 to 30 inches. Mean January temperature is 36 degrees F., mean July temperature is 64 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F. The frost-free season is l60 to 210 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bow, Catla, Clallam and Swinomish soils. Bow soils are in a fine family. Catla and Clallam soils have a loamy control section. Swinomish soils have a medial-skeletal control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained; rapid permeability above the dense glacial till and very slow in it.

USE AND VEGETATION: Laconner soils are used for pasture and forage crop production, forestry, and urban land. Potential natural vegetation is Douglas-fir, grand fir, western redcedar, western swordfern, salal, and Oregon-grape.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Washington. This series is of small extent.
