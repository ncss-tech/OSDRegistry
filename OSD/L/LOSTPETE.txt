LOSTPETE SERIES

The Lostpete series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess and minor amounts of colluvium from gneiss or granite with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. The are on mountain slopes, benches, and ridges. Permeability is moderate and slopes range from 10 to 40 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 48 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Lado, Odonnell, and Spacecreek series. Lado soils have 3Bt horizons. Odonnell soils have transitional 2Bt/E and 2E/Btb horizons. Spacecreek soils are moderately well drained with redox concentrations at 28 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lostpete soils are on mountain slopes, benches, and ridges at elevations of 1,900 to 4,600 feet, with slopes of 10 to 40 percent. These soils formed in loess with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. The average annual temperature is 38 to 44 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is 30 to 55 inches. The frost free period is 50 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bouldercreek, Brodeer, Jury, and Rettig series. Bouldercreek soils are on mountain slopes and ridges and are skeletal. Brodeer soils are on mountain slopes and have ashy over loamy particle size control sections. Jury and Rettig soils are on mountain backslopes and lack an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: The soils are used for timber production, wildlife habitat, recreation and watershed. Potential natural vegetation is western redcedar, grand fir, Douglas-fir, western white pine and western larch with an understory of wild ginger, longtube twinflower, bunchberry dogwood, goldthread, queencup beadlily, oneleaf foamflower, sweetscented bedstraw, Pacific yew, American trail plant, dampwoods blueberry, common prince's pine and western rattlesnake plantain.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North central Idaho; Lostpete soils are not extensive.
