LAMEDEER SERIES 

The Lamedeer series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium derived from baked sandstone and shale. These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, sedimentary plains and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lamedeer channery loam, in woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    Oi--2 inches to 0; slightly decomposed pine needles and twigs.  (1 to 3 inches thick) 

    A--0 to 8 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) channery loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common coarse, medium, and fine roots; 20 percent hard angular pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick) 

    Bw1--8 to 20 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) channery loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; weak fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common coarse, medium, and fine roots; 20 percent hard angular pebbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary. 

    Bw2--20 to 36 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) very channery loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common coarse and medium roots; 40 percent hard angular pebbles, 15 percent hard angular cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of Bw horizons is 15 to 40 inches). 

    Bk--36 to 60 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) extremely channery sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common coarse and medium roots; 45 percent hard angular pebbles, 20 percent hard angular cobbles; common moderately thick lime coats on lower surfaces of coarse fragments; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).
