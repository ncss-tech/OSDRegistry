LOCKMAN SERIES

The Lockman series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium from igneous rock.  Lockman soils are on mountainsides and have slopes of 5 to 60 percent.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  The average annual precipitation is about 510 millimetrs, and the average annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Xeric Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lockman stony sandy loam in woodland, (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 3 cm; Undecomposed leaves, needles, twigs and cones.

    Oe--3 to 5 cm; Partially decomposed needles, leaves and twigs.

    A--5 to 38 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) stony sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure that parts to weak fine granular; soft, very friable; many very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; about 30 to 40% rounded 5 to 10 cm. krotivinas that are brown (10YR 5/3) dry and very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; slightly acid (pH 6.3); clear smooth boundary.  (25 to 28 cm thick)

    Bw--38 to 53 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky; many very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; many fine tubular pores; 5 percent pebbles; about 30 percent rounded 5 to 10 cm, krotivinas that are light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry and grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual smooth boundary.  (13 to 23 cm thick)

    C1--53 to 79 cm; pale olive (5Y 6/3) sandy loam, olive (5Y 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable; common very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.5); abrupt smooth boundary.  (23 to 28 cm thick)

    C2--79 to 104 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable; few very fine and fine roots; many fine and medium tubular pores; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (20 to 30 cm thick)

    C3--104 to 127 inches;  light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very cobbly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; soft, friable; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 25 percent and 15 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0).

    R--127 cm; andesite bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Arkson, Branham, Clergern, Coski, Dinnen, Sawcreek, Sula, and Teoculli series.  Arkson soils lack a cambic horizon have 20-35 percent rock fragments and occur in a 760 to 1015 millimeters precipitation.  Branham and Sawcreek are moderately deep to bedrock.  Clergern soils have 5YR and redder colors and a base saturation of more than 75 percent.  Coski soils have a cambic that is 38 to 64 cm thick with few clay films.  Dinnen soils have a layer immediately under the surface layer that is extremely hard when dry. Sula soils are very fine, sandy loam or silt loam in the upper part of the control section and are moderately permeable.  Teoculli soils lack a cambic, are moderately permeable and have less than 35 percent fine sand and coarse.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lockman soils are on mountainsides and have slopes of 5 to 60 percent.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from igneous rock.  Elevation is 1585 to 2500 meters.  The climate has cold moist winters and cool summers.  Average annual precipitation is 455 to 610 millimeters most of which falls as snow and early spring rain.  The average annual temperature is 2 to 4 degrees C.  The frost-free period is less than 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Earcree, Elkcreek, Gaib, Moonstone, and Roanhide soils.  Earcree soils have mollic epipedons greater than 16 inches thick.  Elkcreek, Moonstone, and Roanhide soils are 50 to 100 cm deep. Gaib soils are 25 to 50 cm deep.  Earcree soils occur on the same landscape as Lockman.  Elkcreek, Gaib, Moonstone, and Roanhide soils are on south and west-facing mountainsides.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to very rapid runoff; permeability is moderately rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for woodland.  Vegetation is Douglas-Fir, Ponderosa pine, serviceberry, and heartleaf arnica.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Lockman soils are of limited extent in south central Idaho.
