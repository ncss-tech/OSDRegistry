LOCKMAN SERIES



The Lockman series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in

residuum and colluvium from igneous rock.  Lockman soils are on

mountainsides and have slopes of 5 to 60 percent.  Permeability is

moderately rapid.  The average annual precipitation is about 20 inches,

and the average annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Xeric Haplocryolls



TYPICAL PEDON:  Lockman stony sandy loam in woodland, (Colors are for

dry soil unless otherwise noted).



    Oil--2 to 1 inch; Undecomposed leaves, needles, twigs and cones.



    0i2--1 to 0 inch; Partially decomposed needles, leaves and twigs.



    A--0 to 13 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) stony sandy loam,

very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky

structure that parts to weak fine granular; soft, very friable; many

very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine

interstitial pores; about 30 to 40% rounded 5 to 10 cm. krotivinas that

are brown (10YR 5/3) dry and very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist;

slightly acid (pH 6.3); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 15 inches thick)



    Bw--13 to 19 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) sandy loam, brown

moist; (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure;

slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky; many very fine and fine, few

medium and coarse roots; many fine tubular pores; 5 percent pebbles;

about 30 percent rounded 5 to 10 cm, krotivinas that are light grayish

brown (10YR 6/2) dry and grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderately

acid (pH 6.0); gradual smooth boundary.  (5 to 9 inches thick)



    C1--19 to 29 inches; pale olive (5Y 6/3) sandy loam, olive (5Y 5/3)

moist; massive; slightly hard, friable; common very fine and fine, few

medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine, few medium and coarse

roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.5);

abrupt smooth boundary.  (9 to 11 inches thick)



    C2--29 to 39 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy loam,

yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable; few

very fine and fine roots; many fine and medium tubular pores;

moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 12 inches

thick)



    C3--39 to 48 inches;  light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very cobbly

sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; soft, friable;

few very fine and fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 25

percent and 15 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0).



    R--48 inches; andesite bedrock.



TYPE LOCATION:  Camas County, Idaho; about 5 miles west and 6 miles

north of Corral; 1100 feet east and 1900 feet south of the northwest

corner section 16, T. 1 N., R. 12 E.

Cr horizon - may be present in some pedons

Base saturation - 50 to 75 percent

Clay content in control section - 5 to 15 percent



A horizons

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Arkson, Branham, Clergern, Coski,

Dinnen, Sawcreek, Sula, and Teoculli series.  Arkson soils lack a

cambic horizon have 20-35 percent rock fragments and occur in a 30 to

40 inch precipitation.  Branham and Sawcreek are moderately deep to

bed-rock.  Clergern soils have 5YR and redder colors and a base

saturation of more than 75 percent.  Coski soils have a cambic that is

15 to 25 inches thick with few clay films.  Dinnen soils have a layer

immediately under the surface layer that is extremely hard when dry.

Sula soils are very fine, sandy loam or silt loam in the upper part of

the control section and are moderately permeable.  Teoculli soils lack

a cambic, are moderately permeable and have less than 35 percent fine

sand and coarse.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lockman soils are on mountainsides and have slopes

of 5 to 60 percent.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from

igneous rock.  Elevation is 5200 to 8200 feet.  The climate has cold

moist winters and cool summers.  Average annual precipitation is 18 to

24 inches most of which falls as snow and early spring rain.  The

average annual temperature is 36 to 40 degrees F.  The frost-free

period is less than 60 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Earcree, Elkcreek,

Gaib, Moonstone, and Roanhide soils.  Earcree soils have mollic

epipedons greater than 16 inches thick.  Elkcreek, Moonstone, and

Roanhide soils are 20 to 40 inches deep. Gaib soils are 10 to 20 inches

deep.  Earcree soils occur on the same landscape as Lockman.  Elkcreek,

Gaib, Moonstone, and Roanhide soils are on south and west-facing

mountainsides.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to very rapid runoff;

permeability is moderately rapid.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for woodland.  Vegetation is

Douglas-Fir, Ponderosa pine, serviceberry, and heartleaf arnica.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Lockman soils are of limited extent in south

central Idaho.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon

are:



Mollic epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to approximately 13

inches (A horizon).



Particle size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of

the A horizon, Bw, C1, C2, and part of the C3 horizon).
