LOVELL SERIES

The Lovell series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from loess weathered from basalt and medisedimentary rocks mixed with volcanic ash.  Lovell soils are in concave positions or depressions on flood plains. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TYPE LOCATION:  Benewah County, Idaho; about 600 feet north and 45 feet east of center of section 10, T.44N., R.5W.  Latitude-47 degrees, 9 minutes, 47.3 seconds North and Longitude-116 degrees, 56 minutes, 45.4 seconds West

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

The mean annual soil temperature is 41 to 47 degrees F
Thickness of volcanic ash (aquandic feature Ap and Eg horizons)--12 to 20 inches, contains 12 to 25 percent glass, and Al + 1/2Fe is 0.15 to 0.30
Depth to redox features (black manganese concretions) and low chroma matrix--6 to 10 inches
Depth to the top of the perched water table (epi saturation)--13 to 20 inches
Depth to the top of the argillic horizon (Bt1)--15 to 25 inches
Apparent water table (endo saturation)--is present below 40 inches

The Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist. It is moderately acid or slighty acid.  Base saturation by sum is 60 to 75 percent.  Clay content is 15 to 25 percent

The Eg and EBtg horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist and chroma of 1 dry, 1 or 2 moist.  It is slighty acid or neutral.  Base saturation by sum is 70 to 85 percent.  Clay content is 15 to 25 percent

The Bt and 2Bt horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and 2 through 4 moist.  It is moderately acid to neutral,  Base saturation by sum is 80 to 90 percent.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam or loam in the lower part.  Clay content is 20 to 30 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  The Porrett and Teneb series are similar.  Porrett soils have redox features at depths of 0 to 6 inches from the soil surface are very poorly drained.  Teneb soils lack an albic horizon and are classified as mixed, active.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Lovell soils are in the concave positions or depressions on flood plains. They formed in alluvium from loess, weathered from basalt and medisedimentary rocks mixed with volcanic ash.  Elevation  2,000 to 2,800 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 23 inches. The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 90 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Latahco soil.  Latahco soils have a mollic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; very slow runoff; slow permeability.  Flooding is frequent or occasional in the spring.  A perched water table is present at 13 to 20 inches in the spring and an apparent water table is present at 38 to more than 60 inches in the spring and summer. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are drained and under cultivation of small grain, hay and pasture. The natural vegetation is mainly tufted hairgrass, sedges, rushes and willows.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Idaho. The series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Benewah County, Idaho, 1975.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--from 0 to 18 inches
Albic horizon--from 14 to 18 inches; the Eg1 horizon is not part of the albic horizon because the moist color value is 2.
Argillic horizon--from 22 to 51 inches
Aquandic feature--from 0 to 18 inches the (Al+1/2Fe) X 60 plus the (glass)=34;  (.15) X 60 plus (25)=34
Episaturation--layer that perches the water is the argillic horizon
Particle-size control section--22 to 42 inches; fine-silty but borderline to fine-loamy.

ADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL pedon ID is S04ID009-011 and pedon number is 05N0151.  The pedon is near the typical pedon but the particle-size class family is fine-loamy near coarse-loamy.
