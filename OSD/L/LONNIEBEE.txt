LONNIEBEE SERIES

The Lonniebee series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from interbedded sandstone,  shale or argillite.  These soils are on mountains and hills.  Slopes are 4 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 36 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Eutric Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Lonniebee channery loam, in forest (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

 Oi--0 to 1 inch; slightly decomposed needles, twigs and leaves. (1 to 2 inches thick)

 E--1 to 11 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) channery loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate very fine and fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; common fine and few medium pores; 20 percent channers, 5 percent flagstones, 5 percent angular stones; slightly acid (pH 6.2) gradual smooth boundary. (7 to 16 inches thick)

 Bt1--11 to 19 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very flaggy clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium roots; common very fine, and few fine and medium pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds and channer surfaces; 25 percent channers, 25 percent flagstones; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear smooth boundary.

 Bt2--19 to 33 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very flaggy clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium roots; common very fine, and few fine and medium pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and channer surfaces; 25 percent channers, 30 percent flagstones; moderately acid (pH 5.6); gradual wavy boundary. (combined thickness of Bt1, Bt2 horizons - 13 to 24 inches)

 Cr--33 to 38 inches; weathered and fractured sandstone bedrock.

 R--38 inches; hard sandstone bedrock.
