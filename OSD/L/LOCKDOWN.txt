LOCKDOWN SERIES

The Lockdown series consists of deep, well drained soils with very slow permeability that formed in alluvium from tuff and volcaniclastic sediments. Slopes range from 4 to 15 percent in foothills. The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Chromic Calcixererts

TYPICAL PEDON: Lockdown clay loam -- on a linear southeast-facing slope of 13 percent, in rangeland at 3,255 feet elevation. The surface has cracks .2 to 1.5 inches wide and 4 to 10 inches apart. When described on November 1, 1995, the soil was dry to 12 inches and slightly moist below. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

(combined Btss - 12 to 20 inches thick)

	Btk1--22 to 27 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; cracks less than 5 mm wide; common prominent clay films on faces of peds and in pores; common fine and medium strongly effervescent seams and masses of segregated calcium carbonate; neutral (pH 7.3); clear wavy boundary.

	Btk2--27 to 41 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and in pores; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual wavy boundary. (combined Btk - 4 to 20 inches thick)

	Bk--41 to 53 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (6 to 18 inches thick)

	Cr--53 to 60 inches; slightly fractured tuff with seams of calcium carbonates.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series listed with this classification. Brifox (T) soils are similar, but have an average annual soil temperature less than 47 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lockdown soils are moderately to strongly sloping on structural benches at elevations of 2,900 to 3,300 feet. Slopes range from 4 to 15 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from tuff and volcaniclastic sediments. The climate is cool and moist in the winter and warm and dry in the summer. Average annual precipitation is 15 to 16 inches. Average annual temperature is 49 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free period is 130 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Castlerock and Shafer soils. Castlerock soils have an aridic soil moisture regime, do not have cracks to the surface and are on convex landscape positions. Shafer soils are 20 to 40 inches deep, are noncalcareous and on similar landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Lockdown soils are used mainly for rangeland. The dominant natural vegetation is biscuitroot.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwestern Idaho. MLRA 10. Lockdown soils are not extensive.
