LAWARD SERIES

The Laward series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Laward soils are on valley floors.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 500 millimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 2.2 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic Argic Cryaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Laward silty clay loam, on a level 0 percent slope in pasture at an elevation of 1946 meters. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oe--0 to 6 cm; black (10YR 2/1) mucky peat, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; rubbed and pressed hemic material; about 85 percent unrubbed fibers; 50 percent rubbed; many very fine and fine, and common medium roots; very slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 8 cm thick)

    A--6 to 17 cm; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silty clay loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; strong fine subangular structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and few fine and medium roots; many fine irregular and tubular pores; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 35 cm thick)

    ABt--17 to 35 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) silty clay, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; common course prismatic structure parting to strong medium angular blocky; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 5 percent faint clay films on faces of peds; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 35 cm thick)

    Bkg1--35 to 89 cm; white (10YR 8/1) silty clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; strong coarse subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few medium roots; common fine tubular pores; 40 percent fine irregular masses of secondary calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; 10 percent fine faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) oxidized iron masses; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual smooth boundary. 

    Bkg2--89 to 120 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silty clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; many fine tubular pores; 5 percent fine irregular masses of secondary calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; 2 percent fine manganese masses; 10 percent fine faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) oxidized iron masses; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the Bkg horizons is 65 to 100 cm)

    Cg--120 to 150 cm; pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/2) moist; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; 25 percent medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) oxidized iron masses; 30 percent coarse distinct greenish gray (5GY 6/1) iron depletions; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).
