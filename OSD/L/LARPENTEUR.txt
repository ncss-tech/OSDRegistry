LARPENTEUR SERIES

The Larpenteur series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils on old stream meanders and natural levees on flood plains.  They formed in medium to moderately fine textured calcareous alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 29 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquic Hapludolls

Larpenteur soils were formerly included with the Colo and Zook series or mapped as a calcareous variant of these series in previous surveys. Larpenteur soils were formerly mapped as Colo, moderately deep to silt loam phase.
