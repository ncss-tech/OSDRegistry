LAMBERJACK SERIES

The Lamberjack series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy, gravelly, and sandy outwash 152 to 203 cm (60 to 80 inches) thick overlying till. These soils are on outwash plains and in outwash areas on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 cm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Aubbeenaubbee, Baugo, Crosier, Haskins, and Shebeon series. Aubbeenaubbee, Baugo, and Crosier soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the argillic horizon. Haskins soils have a densic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Shebeon soils have carbonates within a depth of 89 cm (35 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Lamberjack soils are on outwash plains and in outwash areas on till plains of late Wisconsin age. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Lamberjack soils formed in loamy, gravelly, and sandy outwash 152 to 203 cm (60 to 80 inches) thick overlying dense till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 1067 mm (32 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 13 degrees C (49 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 180 days. Elevation is 213 to 305 meters (700 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alvada, Oshtemo, Shawtown, and Thackery soils. The well drained Oshtemo and Shawtown soils are on higher positions or more sloping positions on the outwash plain. The moderately well drained Thackery soils are on more convex or slightly higher landscape positions. The very poorly drained Alvada soils are on flats and in depressions and drainageways.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm (0.5 to 1.5 feet) between November and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum, very high in the gravelly substratum, and low in the underlying till. Permeability is moderate in the solum, rapid in the gravelly substratum, and slow or very slow in the underlying till.

USE AND VEGETATION: A large proportion is under cultivation, primarily corn, soybeans, wheat, and hay. A few areas are used for specialty crops such as sugar beets or tomatoes. Some areas are in mixed hardwood forest. Native vegetation is mixed hardwood forest of beech, elm, hickory, maple and oak.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West central Ohio, and possibly eastern Indiana; MLRAs 99 and 111B. The type location is in MLRA 111B. The series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Hancock County, Ohio, 1997.

REMARKS: Lamberjack soils are being separated from Digby, and possibly Sleeth soils during modernization projects in MLRA 111B.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 28 cm (Ap horizon).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 28 to 112 cm (Bt, Btg, 2Btg horizons).
Densic contact: at 157 cm (top of the 3Cdg horizon).
Aquic conditions: redox features in all horizons below a depth of 28 cm.

Supporting laboratory data is needed to confirm the presence of densic materials in the 3Cd horizon.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory characterization data (HK-45) from The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory is available for the typical pedon.

Representative data mapunit is DMU ID 130008 in MO 11.
