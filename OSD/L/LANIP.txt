LANIP SERIES


The Lanip series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. The Lanip soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Blackmagic (CA), Brenda (NM), Cornville (AZ), Dona Ana (NM), Elizario (NM), Hap (NM), Jagerson (AZ), Kidwell (NV), Madurez (NM), Mcnew (NM), Mohave (AZ), Nutt (NM), Poachie (AZ), and Tres Hermanos (NM) series. Brenda, Cornville, Dona Ana, Elizario, Hap, Madurez, Mcnew, Mohave, Nutt, Poachie, and Tres Hermanos soils have significant peaks of summer moisture that affect the moisture control section and are not consistent with the moisture distribution of the Mojave Desert. Blackmagic soils have Btky horizons and Btk2 horizons with 30 to 55 percent rock fragments. Jagerson soils are 14 to 24 inches to the base of the argillic horizon and do not have Bk horizons above the argillic. Kidwell soils have non-calcareous argillic horizons and do not have Bk horizons above the argillic.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lanip soils are on fan remnants. These soils are formed in mixed alluvium. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent. Elevations are 2,400 to 4,200 feet. The climate is hot and arid with warm, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 7 inches; mean annual air temperature is 57 to 63 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 180 to 240 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Arizo, Filaree, Kidwell, Nickel, Orwash and Tenwell series. Arizo soils have sandy-skeletal particle-size control section and lack an argillic horizon. Filaree soils have coarse-loamy particle-size control section and lack an argillic horizon. Kidwell soils have a calcic horizon. Nickel soils lack an argillic horizon, have a calcic horizon and a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section. Orwash soils have a sandy particle-size control section. Tenwell soils have a moderately deep duripan. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderately slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly big galleta, bush muhly, Indian ricegrass, creosotebush, ephedra and winterfat. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southern Nevada. MLRA 30. These soils are moderately extensive.
