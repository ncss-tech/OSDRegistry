LAVAL SERIES

The Laval series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granitic and/or sedimentary rock. The Laval soils are on alluvial fans and/or flood plains. Slope is 1 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 178 to 254 mm (7 to 10 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C (64 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Sandy-skeletal, mixed, thermic Xeric Torrifluvents

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Laval soils are on stream terraces. Slope is 1 to 15 percent. Laval soils formed in alluvium derived from granitoid and/or sedimentary rock. Elevations are 142 to 887 meters (465 to 2,910 feet). The climate is arid with hot dry summers and cool, somewhat moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 178 to 254 mm (7 to 10 inches). The mean annual temperature is 16 to 18 degrees C (61 to 65 degrees F). Mean July temperature is about 29.4 degrees C (85 degrees F), and mean January temperature is about 8 degrees C (47 degrees F) The frost-free season is 250 to 300 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cerini, Excelsior, Guijarral, Pleitito, and Tupman soils. Cerini soils on alluvial fans have a fine-loamy particle-size class. Excelsior soils on alluvial fans and bars and channels on flood plains have a coarse-loamy particle-size class and a calcareous mineralogy class. Guijarral soils on fan remnants have a coarse-loamy particle-size class. Pleitito soils on alluvial fans and flood plains have a coarse-loamy particle-size class and a calcareous mineralogy class. Tupman soils on fan remnants and stream terraces have a coarse-loamy particle-size class.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; slow runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity. These soils are subject to frequent flooding.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Laval soils are used for livestock grazing and for irrigated field and row crops, orchards, and vineyards. Native vegetation is red brome, redstem filaree, locoweed, mustard, and coyote bush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Along the rim of the Southern San Joaquin Valley of California, MLRA 17. The series is not extensive.
