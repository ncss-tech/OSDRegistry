LIND SERIES

The Lind series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.  Lind soils are on fan remnants and structural benches.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lind loam, on an east facing 2 percent slope under pasture grasses at an elevation of 5130 feet.  (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

TYPE LOCATION:  Uintah County, Utah; 1 mile southeast of Naples; 300 feet south, 500 feet west of the northeast corner of  sec. 6, T.5S., R.22E., SLBM; 40 degrees, 25 minutes, 8 seconds north latitude and 109 degrees, 28 minutes, 52 seconds west longitude; USGS Naples, Utah quadrangle.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture:  The soil moisture control section is influenced by precipitation that falls evenly throughout the year except for a slight increase in the late summer and early fall.  This soil occurs in an area considered to be Typic Aridic.  It has an aridic soil moisture regime with aquic conditions.

Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 50 degrees F.  

Particle-size control section (weighted average): 13 to 18 percent silicate clay with 18 to 35 percent total clay .

Depth to calcic horizon:  5 to 30 inches

Depth to gypsiferous material:  2 to 5 inches with a few pedons that have gypsum at the surface.

Depth to endosaturation:  18 to 40 inches to irrigation induced saturation during the months of April through December

A horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4 dry or moist
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 5 to 10 percent
Gypsum: 0 to 2 percent

By horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 3 or 4 dry or moist
Texture: dominantly loam but includes sandy clay loam.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 5 to 10 percent
Gypsum: 0 to 2 percent

Bk horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4 dry or moist
Texture: dominantly loam but includes sandy clay loam, sandy loam, and clay loam
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 15 to 40 percent in the upper part and 5 to 15 percent in the lower part
Gypsum: 1 to 3 percent

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Crib and Yonic series.  Crib soils have lithologic discontinuities with layers that have greater than 35 percent rock fragments below 40 inches.  Yonic soils have less than 18 percent total clay.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: alluvium derived from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks
Landforms: fan remnants and structural benches
Slopes: 0 to 4 percent
Elevation: 4,900 to 5,600 feet
Mean annual air temperature: 45 to 47 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 5 to 8 inches
Freeze-free period is 110 to 125 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Boreham soils on structural benches and fan remnants; Nolava soils on fan remnants; and the competing Crib soils on structural benches and fan remnants.  Boreham and Nolava soils are well drained and do not have water tables.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; low runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally for irrigated pasture.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Utah; MLRA 34.  The series is of small extent.
