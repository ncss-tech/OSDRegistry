SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Hyde County, North Carolina; 1996.

REMARKS: Longshoal soils were previously mapped with the Lafitte series (LA). The Lafitte series was reclassified as loamy, mixed, euic, hyperthermic Terric Medisaprists.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon--
Histosols (Typic)--have organic materials that total 40 cm or more between the soil surface and a depth of 50 centimeters and total thickness of organic materials exceeds 130 centimeters in depth - the zone from a depth of 0 to 162 cm (Oese, Oase1, Oase2, Oase3, O'ese, O'ase).
Hemic soil materials--the zone from the soil surface to 42 centimeters (0 to 16 inches) and 114 to 137 centimeters (45 to 54 inches). (Oese and O'ese horizons)
Sapric soil materials--the zone from 42 to 114 centimeters (16 to 45 inches) and 137 to 162 centimeters (54 to 64 inches). (Oase1, Oase2, Oase3 and O'ase horizons)
Peraquic conditions--continuous endosaturation with very frequent tidal flooding.
Hyposulfidic soil materials--sulfurous odors, and incubated pH decrease greater than 1.0 unit and remains above 4.0 the zone from the soil surface to 200 centimeters.
