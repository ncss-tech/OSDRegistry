LAMBE SERIES

The Lambe series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly alluvium and colluvium deposits derived from granite, gneiss, and mica schist.  Lambe soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.
