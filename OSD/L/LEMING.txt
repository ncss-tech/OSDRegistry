LEMING SERIES

The Leming series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium of Pleistocene age. These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on high stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (70 degrees F).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mostly cultivated or in improved pasture.  Cultivated crops are grain sorghum, cotton and peanuts.  Pastures are mostly coastal bermudagrass.  Range vegetation consists of hooded windmillgrass, fringeleaf paspalum, threeawn, fall witchgrass, feathery and little bluestems, and scattered mesquite and oak trees.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Bexar County, Texas; 1964.

REMARKS: Classification change from Aquic Arenic Paleustalfs to Arenic Paleustalfs based on the fact that these soils do not have aquic conditions in most years.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - 0 to 79 cm (0 to 31 in.)  (A and E horizon)
Argillic horizon - 79 to 203 cm (31 to 80 in).  (Btk horizons)
Arenic feature - sandy particle size in the A and E horizons from 0 to 79 cm  (0 to 31 in.)
Pale feature - clayey particle size in the upper Bt horizon, and 20 percent increase in clay (absolute) between the E and Bt horizons.
