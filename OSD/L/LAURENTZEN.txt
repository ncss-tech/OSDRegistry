LAURENTZEN SERIES



The Laurentzen series consists of deep and very deep, well drained

soils that formed in alluvium.  Laurentzen soils are on fan terraces or

basalt plains and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  Permeability is

moderately slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches,

and the average annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Ultic Argixerolls



TYPICAL PEDON:  Laurentzen loam in rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil

unless otherwise noted).



    A1--0 to 7 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2)

moist; weak medium platy structure parting to weak fine granular; soft,

friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine

roots; many very fine interstitial pores; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear

smooth boundary.  (2 to 8 inches thick)



    A2--7 to 14 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2)

moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine

granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic;

many very fine and fine roots; common fine and medium tubular pores;

neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 17 inches thick)



    Bt1--14 to 23 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) light clay loam, dark brown

(7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak medium and coarse prismatic structure parting

to moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky; hard, firm, sticky and

plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine and medium tubular

pores; thin nearly continuous clay films on faces of peds and in pores;

neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)



    Bt2--23 to 30 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) clay loam, dark reddish

brown (5YR 3/4) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to

moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many

very fine and fine roots; many fine and medium tubular pores; thin

continuous clay films on faces of peds and in pores; many 1 to 2 cm.

krotovinas; neutral (pH 6.6); clear irregular boundary.  (5 to 11

inches thick)



    Bt3--30 to 42 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay loam, dark reddish

brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky

structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many very fine

and fine roots; many fine and medium tubular pores; thin continuous

clay films on faces of peds and in pores; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy

boundary.  (10 to 16 inches thick)



    Bt4--42 to 60 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) cobbly clay loam, dark

reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular

blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, sticky and plastic; few

fine roots; many fine and medium pores; thin patchy clay films on

horizontal and vertical faces of peds; 15 percent basalt cobbles and 20

percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8).



TYPE LOCATION:  Camas County, Idaho; about 2.5 miles north and 2 miles

west of Hill City; 1,400 feet east and 2,300 feet south of the

northwest corner of sec. 18, T. 1 S., R. 12 E.



RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Depth to bedrock - 40 to 72 inches

Average annual soil temperature - 42 to 46 degrees F.

Thickness of mollic epipedon - 20 to 35 inches

Base saturation - 50 to 75 percent in upper 75 cm

Reaction - slightly acid or neutral



A horizon

Hue - 10YR or 7.5YR

Value - 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist

Clay content - 18 to 27 percent



Bt horizons

Hue - 10YR through 5YR

Value - 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist

Chroma - 2 through 4 dry or moist

Texture - CL, SICL, L

Clay content - 22 to 35 percent

Sand - contains less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand



COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  The

similar Brinegar series is fine-loamy and moderately well drained.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Laurentzen soils are on fan terraces or basalt

plains and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in

alluvium.  Elevations are 4,800 to 6,000 feet.  The soils have warm dry

summers and cold moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 12

to 16 inches, most of which comes as early spring rain and winter

snow.  The average annual air temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F.  The

frost-free period is 60 to 100 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Gaib, Harahill, Manard,

Polecreek, and Magic soils.  Gaib and Polecreek soils are 10 to 20

inches deep to bedrock.  Manard, Harahill, and Magic are 20 to 40

inches deep.  Harahill soils have fine-loamy control sections and lack

argillic horizons.  Manard soils have a clayey control section.

Polecreek are clayey-skeletal and Magic soils are clayey throughout.

Gaib soils are on foothills and mountainsides.  Harahill, Manard,

Polecreek, and Magic are on similar landscapes as the Laurentzen soil.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff;

moderately slow permeability.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for rangeland, small areas used for

non-irrigated cropland.  Vegetation is bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho

fescue, mountain big sagebrush, and antelope bitterbrush.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Basalt plains in the higher elevations of

southwest and southcentral Idaho.  The series is of limited extent.
