LOSTMAN SERIES

The Lostman series consists of very deep, well drained soils on stream terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary and igneous rocks.  Slope is 1 to 7 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 63 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON: Lostman very gravelly sandy loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak thin platy structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; 55 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick)

    Bw1--3 to 8 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) gravelly fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; strong coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine and medium roots; few fine tubular pores; 25 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw2--8 to 21 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) gravelly fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, common fine, and few medium roots; common very fine and few medium tubular pores; 25 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick)

    Bw3--21 to 35 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) gravelly fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 16 inches thick)

    Bk--35 to 49 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) gravelly fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel; strongly effervescent, few faint calcium carbonate coatings on undersides of gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 16 inches thick)

    2Ck--49 to 60 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely gravelly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 75 percent gravel; violently effervescent, few faint calcium carbonate coatings on undersides of gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Mohave County, Arizona.  1,450 feet north and 2,300 feet east of the southwest corner of section 15, T. 15 N., R. 11 W. Gila and Salt River Base Meridian, in Peach Springs Canyon.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture: Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during December - March and for less than 20 days cumulative during July - September.  Driest during May and June.  Typic aridic soil moisture regime.

Soil Temperature: 60 to 72 degrees F.

Rock fragments: averages 15 to 35 percent, dominantly gravel in the control section.  The upper ten inches may contain less than 15 percent gravel.  Below 40 inches, the substratum may contain more than 35 percent.

Calcium carbonate equivalent: 5 to 10 percent increasing with depth


A horizon

Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR

Value: 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist

Chroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist


Bw and Bk horizons

Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR

Value:  4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist

Chroma:  3 through 5, dry or moist


Texture: sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam

Reaction: slightly to moderately alkaline


C horizon

Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR

Value: 5 or 6 dry

Texture: loamy coarse sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, loam

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Agustin (AZ), Filaree (AZ), Hayhook (AZ), Nasagold (CA), Pajarito (NM), Pyxo (CA) and Sahuarita (AZ) series.  Agustin soils have a decrease in calcium carbonate content with depth.    Filaree and Hayhook soils are noncalcareous to depths of 20 inches or more.  Nasagold receive less precipitation and have a thin Cambic horizon with the lower depth within 20 inches. Pajarito soils contain less than 15 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Pyxo soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Sahuarita soils have buried argillic horizons at depths of 20 to 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lostman series are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 1 to 7 percent. Elevations are 1,600 to 4,400 feet.  These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary and igneous rocks.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 12 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 58 to 70 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 200 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Arizo, Hindu and Stagecoach series and the very steep canyon escarpments of Torriorthents.  Arizo soils have a sandy-skeletal particle-size class.  Hindu soils are shallow to limestone.  Stagecoach soils are loamy-skeletal and contain greater than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the subsoil.  Torriorthents do not have cambic horizons and commonly contain more than 35 percent rock fragments.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; very low to low runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Lostman soils are used for livestock grazing.  The present vegetation is dominantly bush muhly, black grama, spike dropseed, buckhorn cholla, fourwing saltbush and Nevada Mormon-tea.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Arizona.  This series is extensive in MLRA 30.
