SERIES PROPOSED: New Castle County, Delaware, 1998

REMARKS: Leipsic soils were previously mapped with the Keyport or Mattapex series.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to 10 inches
Argillic horizon--the zone from 20 to 45 inches
Aquic conditions--the soil has redox depletions and concentrations within the upper 24 inches of the argillic horizon, with periodic saturation and reduction at some time during the year
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches

ADDITIONAL DATA: This pedon sampled as S95DE003-003.  Additional reference samples S95DE-003-006 and S95DE-003-008.

Data Map Unit ID:  To be developed.
