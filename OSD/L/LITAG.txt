LITAG SERIES

The Litag series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum or colluvium from welded tuff or rhyolite bedrock.  These soils are on alluvial fans, footslopes, mountains and hills. Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-skeletal, glassy, frigid Vitrandic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Litag gravelly ashy sandy clay loam, in forest (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 1 inch; partially decomposed needles, twigs and leaves.

    A--1 to 3 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) mucky loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak very fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; 5 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 4 inches thick)

    E1--3 to 9 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) gravelly ashy sandy clay loam, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots, common medium roots and few coarse roots; many medium tubular pores; 5 percent cobbles and 20 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary.

    E2--9 to 20 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) gravelly ashy sandy clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots, common medium roots and few coarse roots; many medium tubular pores; 5 percent cobbles and 25 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of E horizons is 6 to 18 inches.)

    Bw--20 to 35 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) very gravelly ashy sandy clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots, common medium roots and few coarse roots; many medium tubular pores; 10 percent cobbles and 30 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.3) gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 20 inches thick)

    BC--35 to 54 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) very gravelly ashy sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots, few medium and coarse roots; common medium tubular pores; 10 percent cobbles and 35 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual irregular boundary.  (10 to 30 inches thick)

    C--54 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) very cobbly ashy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic;  many very fine and fine roots, few medium and coarse roots; common medium tubular pores; 20 percent cobbles and 30 percent pebbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0)

REMARKS: Soil interpretive record: MT1750.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: an ochric epipedon from the mineral surface to 20 inches (A and E horizons); a cambic horizon from 20 to 53 inches (Bw and BC horizons); a particle size control section from 10 to 40 inches (E2, Bw and BC horizons).
