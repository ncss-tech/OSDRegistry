LAUDERHILL SERIES

The Lauderhill series consists of moderately deep, very poorly drained organic soils that formed in 41 to 91 centimeters (16 to 36 inches) of well decomposed, hydrophytic, herbaceous plant remains overlying limestone bedrock. Lauderhill soils are on rises and/or dip positions in freshwater marshes. Slopes ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1550 millimeters (61 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 24 degrees C (75 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Euic, hyperthermic Lithic Haplosaprists

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class: Very poorly drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat): very high to high
Permeability: rapid 
Surface runoff: negligible
Depth to seasonal high water table: Under natural conditions the soil is covered by water (ponded), or the water table is within 25 centimeters (10 inches) of the surface for 9 to 12 months during most years, except during extended dry periods; in other areas the water table is controlled by anthropogenic activities. 
Flooding frequency and duration: None
Ponding frequency and duration: Frequently for long duration (9 to 12 months)

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Under natural conditions Lauderhill soils are used for water quality, water storage, and wildlife habitat. 
Potential natural vegetation consists of sawgrass, sedges, lilies, spikerush, willow, elderberry and cypress. 
In drained areas under agriculture Lauderhill soils are used for growing sugarcane, corn, sod, improved pasture and other specialty crops.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Major Land Resource Areas (MLRA): This soil mainly occurs in Florida Everglades and Associated Areas (MLRA 156A). It also occurs in less extent in Southern Florida Flatwoods (MLRA 155) and Southern Florida Lowlands (MLRA 156B).
Extent: Large extent
