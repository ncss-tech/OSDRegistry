TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed Typic Haplocryods

TYPICAL PEDON: Liten silt loam - on a west facing slope of 11 percent at 200 feet elevation under paper birch, aspen and white spruce.  (All colors are for moist soil)

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) slightly decomposed plant material; many very fine, fine, few medium and coarse roots; extremely acid (pH 4.3) clear smooth boundary.  (1 to 3 inches thick)

    E--2 to 4 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) silt loam; weak fine granular structure; very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine, few coarse and medium roots; strongly acid (pH 5.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 3 inches thick)

    Bs1--4 to 6 inches; yellowish red (5YR 4/6) very fine sandy loam; weak medium granular structure; very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; moderately acid (pH 5.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 4 inches thick)

    2BC--8 to 17 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) sand; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to single grain; very friable to loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 12 inches thick)

    2C--17 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) sand; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; moderately acid (pH 5.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  Matanuska Valley Area, Alaska: about 6 miles SW of Knik; about 900 feet N. and 700 feet W. of the SW corner of section 1, T.15N., R.4W., Seward Meridian.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

2Bs horizon: (where present)
Matrix color: hue of 5YR or 7.5YR; value of 4 or 5; chroma from 4 to 6
Texture: sandy loam, fine sandy loam, fine sand, loamy fine sand
Reaction class: very strongly acid to moderately acid

2BC horizon: (where present)

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Delyndia and (T) Tawah series. Delyndia soils have a few thin strata of silty and gravelly material in the substratum. Tawah soils lack a silty loess mantle.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Drainage class: somewhat excessively drained
Parent material: thin mantle of loess overlying loose, sandy eolian material
Landform: sand dunes and hills
Slopes: 0 to 35 percent
Climate: transitional maritime - continental 
Mean annual temperature: about 35 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: about 20 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Benka, Delyndia, and Yohn soils. Benka soils have loamy material above sandy material and occur on outwash plains, moraines, and hills. Delyndia soils have this strata of silty and gravelly material in the substratum and occur on hillslopes. Yohn soils have loamy textures through the profile and occur on hillslopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained, low to medium runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or moderately high in the loess mantle, high to very high in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: Wildlife habitat and urban uses. Native vegetation includes paper birch, white spruce, quaking aspen, and low shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 224 Cook Inlet Lowlands, South-central Alaska. The series is of moderate extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: WASILLA, ALASKA
