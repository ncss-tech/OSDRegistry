LOVEDALE SERIES

The Lovedale series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in old alluvium.  These soils are on treads and risers of stream terraces on uplands within the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 15 degrees C (59 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is 787 mm (31 in).
