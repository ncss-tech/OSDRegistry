LONGABAUGH SERIES

The Longabaugh series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from calcareous sandstone and shale.  Longabaugh soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 50 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 73 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 2.5 degrees C.

Midfork soils do not have a cambic horizon and have peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer.  Sawpit soils are moderately well drained and do not have a layer of secondary carbonates.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Aagard, Comodore, Gilluly, and Northorn series.  The Aagard soils have argillic and calcic horizons and are on less sloping mountainsides under aspen.  The Comodore soils are shallow to bedrock and are on ridges under Douglas-fir.  The Gilluly soils have argillic horizons and are on less sloping mountainsides under Douglas-fir.  The Northorn soils have an argillic horizon and are on concave, less sloping mountainsides under Douglas-fir.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for timber and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation consists of Douglas-fir, mountainmahogany, aspen, Oregongrape, Utah serviceberry, Salina wildrye and bluegrass. Utah correlates this soil to High Mountain Very Steep (Douglas-Fir) R048AY53OUT ecological site.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mountains of central Utah, Wasatch Mountains - North; LRR E, MLRA 47A; small extent.  About 5,700 acres (2,300 hectares) in Emery County, Utah.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 200 cm.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 25 to 100 cm.  (parts of the A2, Bk and BCk horizons)
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 34 cm.  (A horizons)
Cambic horizon:  The zone from 34 to 118 cm.  (Bk and BCk horizons)
Horizon with secondary carbonates:  The zone from 34 to 118 cm.  (Bk and BCk horizons)
Lithic contact:  The contact with calcareous sandstone bedrock at 175 cm.  (R horizon)

A continuous or discontinuous layer of partially decomposed twigs, needles and leaves may be present in some pedons.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
