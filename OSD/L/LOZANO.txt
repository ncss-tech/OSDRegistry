LOZANO SERIES

The Lozano series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy sediments.  These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping coastal
terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to about 2 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, hyperthermic Aquic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lozano fine sandy loam--cultivated.
               (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise
stated.)

   Ap--0 to 11 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy
loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive; hard, friable; few fine roots; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to
17 inches thick)

   Bt--11 to 22 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; few fine faint yellowish brown mottles; moderate coarse prismatic structure,
parting to moderate fine and medium blocky; very hard, friable; coatings of clay films and very dark gray (10YR 3/1) coatings on peds; few fine roots; few fine pores; neutral; gradual wavy
boundary.  (7 to 11 inches thick)

   Btk1--22 to 35 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; few fine distinct very dark gray
and yellowish brown mottles; moderate coarse prismatic structure, parting to moderate medium and coarse blocky; very hard, friable; patchy clay films on peds; common fine pores; few weakly cemented calcium carbonate concretions, and common films of calcium
carbonate; neutral; gradual wavy boundary.  (9 to 14 inches
thick)

   Btk2--35 to 47 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) sandy clay
loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; few fine faint brownish yellow mottles; weak coarse blocky structure; very hard, friable; few
thin clay films; common fine pores; many films, threads and soft masses of calcium carbonate, and a few weakly cemented calcium carbonate concretions; calcareous; moderately alkaline; clear
wavy boundary.  (9 to 14 inches thick)

   Ck1--47 to 54 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) sandy clay
loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; few fine faint grayish brown
and yellowish brown mottles; massive; very hard, friable; few
pores; contains about 3 percent by volume of weakly and strongly cemented calcium carbonate concretions; calcareous; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

   Ck2--54 to 63 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) sandy clay
loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; few fine faint brownish yellow mottles; massive; very hard, friable; few fine pores; contains a
few strongly cemented calcium carbonate concretions; calcareous; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Cameron County, Texas; from the intersection of
Farm Road 106 and Texas Highway 345 near Rio Hondo, 0.7 mile east
on Farm Road 106, 1.0 mile south and 0.1 mile east on county road
and 100 feet south.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 37 to 50 inches.
Depth to secondary lime ranges from 17 to 34 inches.  Salinity in
the upper 3 feet of soil is less than 4 mmhos/cm and increases
with depth.

The A horizon is grayish brown (10YR 5/2), dark grayish brown
(10YR 4/2), or dark gray (10YR 4/1).  It is fine sandy loam or
sandy loam and is friable moist, but is massive and hard dry.

The Bt horizon is grayish brown (10YR 5/2), dark grayish brown
(10YR 4/2), or dark gray (10YR 4/1).  Mottles are few to common, faint or distinct in shades of gray or brown.  It is sandy clay
loam and neutral to mildly alkaline.

The Btk horizon is brown (10YR 5/3, 5/4; 7.5YR 5/2), light brown (7.5YR 6/4), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), or light yellowish brown
(10YR 6/4) with few to common, faint and distinct mottles in
shades of gray, brown, and yellow.  It is mildly to moderately alkaline.  Texture is sandy clay loam or clay loam with clay
content of 25 to 35 percent.

The C horizon is pale brown (10YR 6/3), very pale brown (10YR
7/3), or pink (7.5YR 7/4).  It is sandy clay loam or sandy loam.  Accumulations of calcium carbonate ranges from barely visible to about 5 percent by volume of weakly to strongly cemented
concretions and soft masses.  Salinity is less than 8 mmhos/cm.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are Lyford series in the same family and
the similar Brennan, Delfina, Nueces, and Vashti series.  Lyford soils have less than 10 percent (absolute) clay increase from the
A horizon to the Bt horizon, and lack prismatic structure.
Brennan soils lack mottles of chromas of 2 or less within 30
inches of the surface.  Delfina soils have secondary lime
occurring below depths of 34 inches and lack prismatic structure.  Nueces soils have sandy epipedons more than 20 inches thick.
Vashti soils have mean annual soil temperature less than 72
degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lozano soils occupy nearly level deltaic or coastal terraces with plane surfaces.  Slopes dominantly are less than 1 percent, but range up to about 2 percent.  The soil formed
in loamy alluvium or eolian deposits several feet thick.  Climate
is dry subhumid; the mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to
28 inches; mean annual air temperature ranges from 72 to 74
degrees F.; and the Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 30 to 36.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Delfina series and Raymondville, Rio, Tiocano, and Willacy series.
Delfina, Raymondville, and Willacy soils occur on similar
surfaces.  Raymondville soils have a mollic epipedon, and lack an argillic horizon.  Rio soils have a mollic epipedon and have more than 35 percent clay in the Bt horizon.  Tiocano soils are clayey
and have intersecting slickensides.  Rio and Tiocano soils occur
in depressions.  Willacy soils have a mollic epipedon, and lack mottles associated with wetness.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; slow runoff; moderately slow permeability.  A perched water table occurs in
the upper part of the soil a few days after heavy rains.  Under cultivated conditions, the water table is usually within 1 to 3
feet of the surface for several months.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for dry and irrigated cropland and
range.  Crops are mostly cotton, grain sorghum, and winter vegetables.  Vegetation on rangeland consists of a thick
overstory of mesquite, retama, and other thorny shrubs and
grasses consisting of trichloris, lovegrass tridens, plains bristlegrass, hooded windmillgrass, and Arizona cottontop.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Occurs mainly within 30 miles of the
coast in the lower Rio Grande Valley of South Texas, and probably
in Mexico.  Series is moderately extensive.
