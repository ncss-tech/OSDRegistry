LANOLA SERIES

The Lanola series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from limestone.  Lanola soils are on hills, cuestas, ridges, and scarps.  Slopes range from 3 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches (400 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F (11 degrees C).

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy, carbonatic, mesic Lithic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lanola loam, on a east facing, 6 percent slope in trees and grass at an elevation of 6,060 feet (1847 m).  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

   A--0 to 7 inches (0 to 18 cm); brown (10YR 5/3) channery loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate very fine and fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; 25 percent limestone channers; 29 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 12 inches thick)  The surface is covered by 30 percent channers.

   Bk--7 to 12 inches (018 to 31 cm); light gray (10YR 7/2) channery silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; 17 percent limestone channers; common fine distinct carbonate masses; 62 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 8 inches thick)

   R--12 inches( 31 cm); hard fractured limestone. 

TYPE LOCATION:  Las Animas County, Colorado; about 1.5 miles south of Trinchera, Colorado; located about 55 feet east and 1,600 feet north of the southwest corner of sec. 5, T. 35 S., R. 59 W.; Trinchera USGS quad; lat. 37 degrees 1 minutes 12.7 seconds N. and long. 104 degrees 2 minutes 56 seconds W., NAD 1983

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture:  The soil moisture control section is moist intermittently April through August; Ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Laporte series.
Laporte soils:  Laporte at the type location has a maximum precipitation pattern in spring and early summer.  Lanola soils have highest precipitation in July and August.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium and residuum derived from limestone.
Landform:  hills, cuestas, ridges, and scarps
Slopes:  3 to 25 percent
Elevation:  5,500 to 7,000 feet
Mean annual temperature:  47 to 53 degrees F ( 8 to 12 degrees C).
Mean annual precipitation:  14 to 18 inches (36 to 46 cm)
Precipitation pattern:  moist intermittently April though August, with peak periods in July and August.  Driest December through February.
Frost-free period:  120 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Capulin, Penrose, and Ritoazul series.  The Capulin soils are very deep and are on fans and in drainageways.  The Penrose soils do not have a mollic epipedon and are on hills.  The Ritoazul soils are moderately deep to paralithic contact and are on the lower backslopes of hills.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained, very high runoff, saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat; the potential native vegetation is dominantly needlegrass, true mountain mahogany, little bluestem, sideoats grama, western wheatgrass, gambel's oak, oneseed juniper, twoneedle pinyon, and fringed sagewort 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeast New Mexico and southeast Colorado; LRR G, MLRA 70; the soil is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Las Animas County, Colorado, Las Animas County soil survey area, Colorado.  The name was taken from Nola Butte.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section: 0 to 14 inches (0 to 35 cm).
Particle-size control section: 0 to 14 inches (0 to 35 cm).  (A and Bk horizons)
Mollic epipedon:  0 to 8 inches (0 to 20 cm).  (A horizon)
Lithic contact:  The contact with limestone at 14 inches (35 cm).  (R horizon)
Other features:  Carbonatic mineralogy (A and Bk horizons)

Remarks: The series was formerly included in the Laporte series.  Laporte soils have a precipitation pattern that is typically moist in spring and early summer with a decrease in July and August.
