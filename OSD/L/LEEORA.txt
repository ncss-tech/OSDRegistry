LEEORA SERIES

The Leeora series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in loamy glaciolacustrine deposits. These soils are on concave surfaces on glacial lake plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 670 mm. Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Histic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Leeora peat, with a concave slope of 0 percent, on a glacial lake plain, in a cultivated field. Elevation is about 389 meters.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

    Oi--0 to 3 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) peat; 90 to 100 percent sphagnum moss rubbed; massive; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 18 cm thick)

    Ap--3 to 25 cm; black (10YR 2/1) mucky silt loam, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; weak very fine subangular blocky structure, and weak fine and medium granular structure; friable; common fine and very fine roots, moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (18 to 25 cm thick)

    Bg1--25 to 41 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine and very fine roots, moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary. 

    Bg2--41 to 74 cm; gray (10YR 5/1) fine sandy loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. 

    Bg3--74 to 109 cm; gray (10YR 5/1) silt loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) and dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) redoximorphic concentrations; neutral; gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bg horizon ranges 81 to 105 centimeters)

    Cg1--109 to 178 cm; olive gray (5Y 4/2) silt loam; massive; friable; many coarse prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) and dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) redoximorphic concentrations; neutral; gradual wavy boundary.

    Cg2--178 to 203 cm; dark gray (5Y 4/1) silt loam; massive; friable; few medium prominent grayish brown (10YR 5/2) redoximorphic depletions; neutral.

TYPE LOCATION: Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) 88-Northern Minnesota Glacial Lake Basins; St. Louis County, Minnesota, about 2 miles southwest of Meadowlands; located about 1100 feet west and 860 feet north of the southeast corner of section 20, T. 53 N., R. 19 W; USGS Elmer Minnesota topographic quadrangle; latitude 47 degrees 3 minutes 28.5 seconds N., and longitude 92 degrees 46 minutes 9.1 seconds W., NAD 83.

Reaction--slightly acid to neutral 

Ap or A horizon:
Hue-10YR

Reaction--moderately acid to neutral

Bg horizon:
Hue-10YR or 2.5YR

Reaction--moderately acid to neutral 
The Bg horizon typically has distinct to prominent redoximorphic concentrations  

Cg horizon: 
Hue--2.5Y or 5Y
Value--4 to 6
Chroma--1 to 3
Texture--silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or silty clay loam

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent Material-loamy glaciolacustrine deposits
Landform--concave surfaces on glacial lake plains
Slope-0 to 1 percent
Elevation--350 to 490 meters above sea level
Mean annual air temperature-3 to 5 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation--635 to 711 millimeters
Frost free period--95 to 125 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Meadowlands and Joula soils which formed in the same parent material as the Leeora soils and form a hydrosequence with the Leeora soils.
Meadowlands--are on linear flat positions on the landscape
Joula--are on convex positions on the landscape.  

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class--very poorly drained-a frequently saturated zone occurs at the surface during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation, this saturation is considered apparent
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--141.14 to 705 micrometers per second in the organic layer, 4.23 to 42.34 micrometers per second in the loamy mantle, and 1.41 to 42.34 micrometers per second in the underlying loamy glaciolacustrine deposits
Ponding-frequent long ponding in the spring and fall

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cropped for hay or used for pasture.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Physiographic Division--Interior Plains or Laurentian Upland
Physiographic Province--Central Lowland Province or Superior Upland
MLRA--Northern Minnesota Glacial Lake Basins (88)
LRR--K; northern Minnesota
Extent--small
