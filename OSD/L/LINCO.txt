LINCO SERIES

The Linco series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and reworked lacustrine deposits. The Linco soils are on eroded fan remnants, fan remnants, older fan aprons, and pediments. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is 9 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Durinodic Xeric Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON: Linco gravelly sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is partially covered with approximately 25 percent gravel. 

 A--0 to 8 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 20 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 13 cm thick) 

 Bk--8 to 20 cm; pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 20 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); abrupt irregular boundary. (5 to 13 cm thick) 

 2Bqk--20 to 64 cm; pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) gravelly fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few medium roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; slightly brittle matrix; 20 percent gravel; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt irregular boundary. (38 to 50 cm thick) 

 2C--64 to 152 cm; pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) gravelly fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist, with few thin (0.6 to 1.2 cm) strata of gravel-free sandy loam and loamy sand; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few medium roots; many fine interstitial pores; 30 percent gravel; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0).

COMPETING SERIES: These are Enko, Kerrfield, Orovada, Patter, Prinville, and Ultramont soils.   

Enko, Kerrfield, Orovada and Prinville soils are not intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days in the summer due convection storms. Enko, Orovada and Prinville soils average less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Kerrfield soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Patter and Ultramont soils have identifiable secondary calcium carbonate at 25 to 50 cm. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Linco soils are on summits, shoulders, and backslopes of eroded fan remnants, fan remnants, and pediments. These soils formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and reworked lacustrine deposits. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. Elevations are 1,450 to 1,850 meters. The climate is cool semiarid. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 130 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Acana, Armespan, and Lojet soils. Acana soils are shallow to a duripan. Armespan soils average 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Lojet soils are moderately deep to a duripan. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium or high runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Linco soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Potential native vegetation is mainly black sagebrush, rabbitbrush, Nevada ephedra, Indian ricegrass, and Utah juniper. This pedon is correlated to ecological site R029XY008NV, Shallow Calcareous Loam 8-10 P.Z. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: East Central Nevada. These soils are moderate in extent. MLRA 29.
