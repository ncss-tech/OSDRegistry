LONEMAN SERIES 

The Loneman series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash over colluvium. These soils are on backslopes of mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Andic Paleudalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON: Loneman ashy silt loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; undecomposed and slightly decomposed forest litter. 

    A--2 to 3 inch; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) ashy silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; 10 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 1 inches thick) 

    Bw--3 to 11 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) ashy silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; 10 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (6 to 9 inches thick) 

    2E--11 to 28 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) very gravelly loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine and few medium and coarse roots; 10 percent cobbles, 40 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary. (14 to 28 inches thick) 

    2E/Bt--28 to 42 inches; E part (70 percent) is very pale brown (10YR 8/3) very gravelly loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist, Bt part (30 percent) is light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium and common coarse roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent cobbles, 40 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary. (9 to 23 inches thick) 

    2Bt--42 to 60 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) very gravelly clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common medium and coarse roots; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent cobbles, 40 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Loneman soils are used mainly for woodland, understory grazing, and wildlife habitat. Potential native vegetation is mainly Douglas fir, western larch, lodgepole pine, and grand fir. Understory vegetation is mainly pinegrass, twinflower, russet buffaloberry, blue huckleberry, and other forbs and shrubs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Loneman soils are of small extent in the mountains of northwestern Montana.
