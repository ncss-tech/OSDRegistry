LANYON SERIES

The Lanyon series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in 100 to 150 centimeters of lacustrine sediments and in the underlying till. These soils are in broad depressions within the late Wisconsin glacial drift plain. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 740 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--very poorly drained--in an undrained condition, a frequently saturated zone occurs at the surface to a depth of 0.3 meters during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--0.10 to 10.00 micrometers per second in the lacustrine sediments and 1.00 to 14.00 micrometers per second in the underlying till
Ponding--frequently ponded for long duration

USE AND VEGETATION:
Where drained, Lanyon soils are cultivated. The principal crops are corn, soybeans, oats, and legume hay. The natural vegetation is marsh grasses, sedges, and other grasses tolerant of excessive wetness.

Physiographic Division--Interior Plains
Physiographic Province--Central Lowland
Physiographic section--Western lake section
MLRA--Central Iowa and Minnesota Till Prairies (103)

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Webster County, Iowa, 1969.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 41 centimeters (Ap, A, and BA horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 41 to 200 centimeters (Bg1, Bg2, Bkg1, Bkg2, 2Bkg3, and 2BCg horizons);
aquic moisture regime.

With carbonates so significant in this soil, the question arises about calcareous class, but carbonates are not present in all parts between depths of 25 and 50 centimeters.

Classification was changed from Typic Endoaquolls to Vertic Endoaquolls in 3/2004, based on linear extensibility of 6.0 to 8.9 percent within a depth of 100 centimeters.
