LOCKTON SERIES

The Lockton series consists of soils that are moderately deep, moderately well drained soils over gravelly sand on stream terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 64 centimeters (25 inches) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Cumulic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lockton loam - with a slope of less than one percent in an irrigated field.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Ap--0 to 13 centimeters (0 to 5 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and medium granular structure; soft, very friable; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary.

   A--13 to 33 centimeters (5 to 13 inches); dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate medium and coarse granular structure; slightly hard, friable; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (Combined A horizon is 30 to 51 centimeters (12 to 20 inches) thick.)

   AC--33 to 58 centimeters (13 to 23 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary.  (13 to 25 centimeters (5 to 10 inches) thick)

   C1--58 to 69 centimeters (23 to 27 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) coarse sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 13 centimeters (0 to 5 inches) thick)

   2C2--69 to 152 centimeters (27 to 60 inches); very pale brown (10YR 7/3) gravelly coarse sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; common medium distinct reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist redoximorphic concentrations; single grained; loose; about 22 percent gravel; moderately acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Merrick County, Nebraska; about 1.5 miles west of Central City; 549 meters (1,800 feet) north and 30 meters (100 feet) west of the southeast corner of sec. 6, T. 13 N., R. 6 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture: moist in some part from October through April; intermittently moist from May through July; driest in July through September
Moisture regime: ustic
Depth to secondary carbonates: Typically lacking, below 76 centimeters (30 inches) in some profiles
Depth to redoximorphic: in the lower part of A horizon and in C and 2C horizons Some pedons lack redox features above 102 centimeters (40 inches).
Depth to endosaturation: 1 to 2 meters (3 to 5 feet)
Thickness of the mollic epipedon: 51 to 91 centimeters (20 to 36 inches)
Thickness of the solum: 51 to 76 centimeters (20 to 30 inches)
Depth to rock fragments: 51 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches)

A horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: loam, silt loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, sandy loam, and fine sandy loam
Reaction: moderately acid or slightly acid

2C horizon: (C horizon if present)
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 5 to 8 dry, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 1 to 3
Texture: gravelly coarse sand, coarse sandy loam, loamy coarse sand, or sand
Rock Fragments: gravel content within these textures, ranges from 3 to 15 percent gravel by volume; it is commonly stratified
Reaction: moderately acid to neutral

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing soils.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent materials: alluvium 
Landform: stream terraces  
Slope: 0 to 2 percent  
Mean annual precipitation: 51 to 76 centimeters (20 to 30 inches)
Mean annual temperature: 9 to 13 degrees C (48 to 55 degrees F)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Fonner, Alda, Lex, O'Neill, Hall and Merrick soils. 
Alda soils are coarse-loamy, are calcareous at or near the surface, and are somewhat poorly drained. 
Fonner soils are in the sandy family. 
Lex soils have carbonates at or near the surface and are somewhat poorly drained. 
O'Neill soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.
Hall soils are well drained, have an argillic horizon, and are fine-silty.  Merrick soils are fine-loamy.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage: moderately well drained  
Runoff: low.  
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: moderately high to very high  
Seasonal high water table: 1 to 1.5 meters (3 to 5 feet)   
Water table: fluctuates widely, receding to 2 to 3 meters (8 to 10 feet) in the late summer and fall  
Flooding: rarely 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are cultivated.
Principal crops are corn and grain sorghum.  
The native vegetation is mainly big bluestem, switchgrass, Indiangrass, and little bluestem.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central and eastern Nebraska and are of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Merrick County, Nebraska, 1978.

REMARKS:  The laboratory data (S76NE-121-117) indicate this soil has a regular decrease in organic carbon with depth.  However, it is thought to have an irregular decrease.  It is in the same position of other soils that do have an irregular decrease in organic carbon.
