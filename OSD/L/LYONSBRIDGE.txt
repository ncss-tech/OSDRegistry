LYONSBRIDGE SERIES

The Lyonsbridge series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and/or lake sediments.  These soils occur on alluvial fans, fan remnants and lakebeds. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 390 millimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Ustic Calcicryepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lyonsbridge fine sandy loam, in rangeland on a 1 percent slope at 2,025 meters elevation (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

 A--0 to 15 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak very fine granular structure; very friable, soft, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 16 cm thick)

 Bw--15 to 40 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) fine sandy loam; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable, soft, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; 5 percent gravel; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 32 cm thick)

 Bk1--40 to 70 cm; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) loam; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky and nonplastic; 25 percent medium, prominent, irregular soft masses of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent, strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); gradual smooth boundary. (25 to 90 cm thick)

 Bk2--70 to 117 cm; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) silt loam; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; 20 percent fine, distinct, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist, irregular mottles (masses of oxidized iron); weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 15 percent fine, prominent, irregular soft masses of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent, strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 50 cm thick)

 C--117 to 152 cm; pale yellow (2.5Y 7/3) loamy sand; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; 15 percent fine, distinct, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist, irregular mottles (masses of oxidized iron); massive; very friable, soft, nonsticky and nonplastic; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent, strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).
