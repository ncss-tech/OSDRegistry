LANGLESS SERIES

The Langless series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sources.  Langless soils are on lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Coarse-silty, carbonatic, mesic Typic Calciaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Langless silt loam--on a 1 percent slope under grass vegetation at an elevation of 4,385 feet--rangeland.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 3 inches; slightly decomposed plant material composed of grass stems and roots; abrupt smooth boundary.

    Akg1--3 to 9 inches; black (10YR 2/1) silt loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak medium platy structure parting to moderate medium granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many medium and common fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent (35 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 8 inches thick)

    Akg2--9 to 18 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silt loam, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many medium and common fine and very fine roots; few medium and common fine and very fine tubular pores; 20 percent fine masses of secondary carbonate; strongly effervescent (55 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 12 inches thick)

    Bkg1--18 to 25 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, white (10YR 8/1) dry; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common medium and few fine and very fine roots; few medium, fine and very fine tubular pores; 30 percent fine nodules of secondary carbonate; violently effervescent (60 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 16 inches thick)

    Bkg2--25 to 47 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, very pale brown (10YR 8/2) dry; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few medium, fine, and very fine roots; many coarse and common medium, fine, and very fine tubular pores; 15 percent medium nodules of secondary carbonate; violently effervescent (50 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (15 to 30 inches thick)

    Cg--47 to 63 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common coarse and medium and few fine and very fine roots; common coarse and medium and few fine and very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent (20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Langless soils are on lake terraces.  They formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sources.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 4,300 to 4,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches, the mean annual air temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bramwell, Brinnum, and Logan soils.  Bramwell and Brinnum soils do not have mollic epipedons and are on higher lake terraces.  Logan soils are on slightly lower landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; very high surface runoff; moderate permeability (moderately high or high saturated hydraulic conductivity).  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 1 and 1.5 feet (shallow free water occurrence class) between October and June. Cumulative annual duration class is Persistent.  These soils are susceptible to frequent flooding for very long periods between October and June.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Langless soils are used for livestock grazing and hayland.  The native vegetation is Baltic rush, Nebraska sedge, and tufted hairgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho.  These soils are not extensive with about 465 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 28A.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - The zone from 3 to 18 inches (Akg1 and Akg2 horizons).

Calcic horizon - The zone from 9 to 47 inches (Akg2, Bkg1, and Bkg2 horizons).

Aquic conditions - The conditions of endosaturation, reduction, and redoximorphic features between the soil surface and 63 inches at certain times during normal years (parts of the Akg1, Akg2, Bkg1, Bkg2, and Cg horizons).
