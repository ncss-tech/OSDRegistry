LEXSWORTH SERIES

The Lexsworth series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on river valley flood plains.  They formed in 20 to 40 inches of loamy alluvium deposited over coarse sand or gravelly coarse sand.  Permeability is moderate in the solum and very rapid in the substratum.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lexsworth loam with a slopes less than 1 percent in irrigated cropland  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  Ap--0 to 12 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate medium fine granular structure; hard friable; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.

  C1--12 to 19 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) sandy clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

  C2--19 to 26 inches; coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; few fine distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4) redox features; massive; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

  C3--26 to 33 inches; coarse sand, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) moist; single grained; violent effervescence; common medium distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4) redox features; slightly alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary.

  C4--33 to 52 inches; stratified coarse sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; single grained; common medium prominent light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) redox features; slightly alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary.

  C5--52 to 60 inches; stratified fine sand, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; single grained; common medium prominent light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) redox features; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary.

  C6--60 to 80 inches; stratified course sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; neutral; single grained.

  Chappell: have lithic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches
  Creighton: have finer sand throughout the solum, and lack gravel
  Jayem: have finer sand throughout the solum, and lack gravel
  Phiferson: have lithic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
  Parent material: derived from recent alluvium
  Landform: flood plains of large streams

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
  Drainage: Moderately well drained 
  Permeability: moderate in the solum and very rapid in the substratum 
The seasonal high water table: 5 to 8 feet, the water table was at 83 inches at the time of sampling, It is highest during winter and spring when stream flow is highest 
  Flooding: very rare
  Runoff: slow

USE AND VEGETATION:  This soil is used principally as irrigated cropland.  Corn and alfalfa are the most common grown crops.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The Lexsworth series is in western Nebraska and is of small extent.  MLRA 72.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Denver, Colorado

SERIES PROPOSED:  Deuel County, Nebraska, 1998.

REMARKS:   
The diagnostic horizon and other features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon: the zone from 10 to 20 inches (Ap, A1, A2)  
Redoximorphic concentrations: above 40 inches do not reflect the present water table or drainage of the soil 
Down cutting of the river channel and irrigation wells have contributed to the lowering of the ground water table. 
This soil was formerly correlated as a Las soil.
