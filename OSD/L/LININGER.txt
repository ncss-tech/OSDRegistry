LININGER SERIES

The Lininger series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed material weathered from schist, gneiss, and granitic rocks.  Lininger soils are on mountain slopes, foot slopes, ridges and have slopes of 1 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, micaceous, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lininger sandy loam - grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 4 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few visible mica flakes as fine and very fine sand sized particles; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 9 inches thick)

    BA--4 to 8 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; continuous thin clay films on the faces of peds; common visible mica flakes as fine and very fine sand sized particles; 10 to 14 percent pebbles; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt1--8 to 13 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common distinct clay films on the faces of peds; common visible mica flakes as fine and very fine sand sized particles; 10 to 14 percent pebbles; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 12 inches thick)

    Bt2--13 to 32 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) sandy clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; strong medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common distinct clay films on the faces of peds; common visible mica flakes as fine and very fine sand sized particles; 10 to 14 percent pebbles; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 20 inches thick)

    BC--32 to 36 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many visible mica flakes as fine and very fine sand sized particles; 10 to 14 percent pebbles; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 7 inches thick)

    Cr--36 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) weathered schist.

TYPE LOCATION:  Jefferson County, Colorado; approximately 1 mile east of Parmalee School of the Indian Hills Community; 370 feet west of the northeast corner, northwest quarter of Sec. 8, T. 5 S., R. 70 W.

Depth to paralithic contact:  20 to 40 inches to weathered schist, gneiss, or granitic rocks.
Depth to the argillic horizon:  8 to 32 inches
Thickness of the argillic horizon(s):  7 to 24 inches

  Rock fragments:  0 to 35 percent 

A horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR through 2.5Y
Value:  3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma:  2 or 3
Texture:  sandy loam, loam, fine sandy loam
Clay content:  10 to 30 percent
Reaction:  slightly acid to slightly alkaline

Bt horizon(s):
Hue: 2.5Y through 7.5YR 
Value: value of 3 through 6, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma:  2 through 6
Texture:  sandy clay loam, clay loam, loam
Clay content:  18 to 35 percent

COMPETING SERIES: 
The Lumpyridge soils are very deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lininger soils are on mountain slopes and have slopes of 1 to 65 percent.  Elevations range from 6,500 to 8,500 feet.  The soils formed in weathered schist, gneiss, and granitic rocks.  The soils are in a cool semiarid climate with annual precipitation ranging from 18 to 22 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 41 to 46 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 75 to 125 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Breece, Hesperus, and Ratake soils and Trag soils.  Hesperus and Breece soils have a mollic epipedon more than 16 inches thick.  Ratake soils have bedrock at depths less that 20 inches.  Trag soils have lack a paralithic contact above 40 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Soils are used for grazing, hayland, recreation, wildlife, and community development.  Native vegetation is Arizona fescue, mountain muhly, Parry oatgrass, wax currant, mountain mahogany, sticky geranium, fringed sage and sulfur buckwheat.  In places where surface layers are stony, scattered ponderosa pine trees are common.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mountainous areas of north-central Colorado and southern Wyoming. The series is of moderate extent.

Taxonomic Version:  Eighth Edition, 1998

The mineralogy class was changed from paramicaceous to micaceous in 07/2010 by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the responsible MLRA regional office.  The change was necessary based on the eleventh edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2010.
