LEBO SERIES

The Lebo series consists of moderately deep to shale, well drained, soils that formed in residuum from shale interbedded with sandstone.  These soils are on interfluves on plains.  Slope ranges from 8 to 40 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 14 degrees C (58 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 91 centimeters (36 inches).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lebo channery silty clay loam, on a west-facing 25 percent slope in mixed hardwood trees, at an elevation of 279 meters (915 feet) above mean sea level.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

  A--0 to 28 centimeters (0 to 11 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) channery silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; strong medium granular structure; hard, friable; many fine roots; limestone fragments, 20 to 76 mm in diameter, comprise about 20 percent by volume; neutral; gradual wavy boundary.  (18 to 38 centimeters (7 to 15 inches thick)

  Bw--28 to 46 centimeters (11 to 18 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) channery silty clay loam with slightly more clay than in the BC or C horizons, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; strong fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; common fine roots; many pores; coarse fragments by volume consist of 10 percent shale and 20 percent sandstone and range from 2 to 51 mm in diameter; neutral; gradual wavy boundary.  (13 to 46 centimeters (5 to 18 inches thick)

  BC--46 to 71 centimeters (18 to 28 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) channery silty clay loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; common very fine and fine roots; soft silty shale, same size as in BW horizon, comprise about 25 percent by volume; neutral; clear wavy boundary.  (13 to 38 centimeters (5 to 15 inches thick)

  C--71 to 97 centimeters (28 to 38 inches); grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) extremely channery silty clay loam, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) dry; massive; hard, friable; few very fine and fine roots; 80 percent of material consists of grayish brown soft shales with thin seams of sandstone; soil material is between plates of shale and in seams and pockets; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 38 centimeters (0 to 15 inches thick)

  Cr--97 to 122 centimeters (38 to 48 inches); soft silty shale with thin very fine sand component.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Lebo soils are on interfluves on plains.  Slope ranges from 8 to 40 percent.  The soils formed in residuum weathered from clayey shale.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 790 to 1200 mm (31 to 47 inches).  Mean annual temperature ranges from 10 to 16 degrees C (50 to 61 degrees F).  Frost-free period is 175 to 255 days.  Elevation is 232 to 396 meters (760 to 1300 feet) above mean sea level.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices are 62 to 72.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Clareson, Dennis, Eram, and Summit soils.  These soils have a fine-textured argillic horizon.  Clareson soils are higher in the landscape than Lebo soils.  Dennis, Eram, and Summit soils are lower in the landscape than Lebo soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Well drained.  Potential for surface runoff is medium or rapid.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high (1.4 to 4.0 micrometers per second).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mostly used for range or pasture.  Native vegetation is tall prairie grasses or it is a savannah type vegetation of hardwood trees and tall prairie grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  MLRA 112 (Cherokee Prairies) in eastern Kansas.  The series is moderately extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Franklin County, Kansas, 1979.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:
mollic epipedon:  0 to 28 cm (0 to 11 inches) (A horizon)
cambic horizon:  28 to 46 cm (11 to 18 inches) (Bw horizon)
Paralithic contact:  97 cm (38 inches) (Cr horizon)

Drainage is difficult to assess because of color inherited from shale.  Lebo soils are thought to be well drained.  They are not saturated with water at some season or artificially drained.  The name is taken from a town in Coffey County.

Taxonomic class added to the OSD with the 03/2014 revision. Cation-exchange activity class based on characterization data from the KSSL for User Pedon ID 83KS107001.
