REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon
*Mollic epipedon--A, Bt1, Bt2, 2Btb horizons
*Organic matter--decreases irregularly with increasing depth
*Particle-size control section--zone from 25 to 100 cm

Irregular decrease in organic matter with depth

In some pedons, the Bt horizon is absent and Bw and/or AC horizons are present.

07/2022: updates to this document were primarily formatting; also updated the competing series section; expanded the climatic ranges slightly; added information on saturation.
