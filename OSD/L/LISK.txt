LISK SERIES

The Lisk series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits and sandy alluvium derived from weakly consolidated, calcareous sandstone.  These soils are in swales, alluvial fans, sedimentary plains, and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Calciustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Lisk sandy loam, in grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 5 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) sandy loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak medium granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots and many very fine roots; common fine and very fine pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 7 inches thick)

    Bw--5 to 15 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) sandy loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots and many very fine roots; common fine and many very fine pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (9 to 15 inches thick)

    Bk1--15 to 30 inches; pale olive (5Y 6/3) sandy loam, olive (5Y 4/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots and many very fine roots; common fine and very fine pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (11 to 20 inches thick)

    Bk2--30 to 41 inches; pale olive (5Y 6/3) sandy loam, olive (5Y 5/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots and common very fine roots; common fine and very fine pores; effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual smooth boundary.  (10 to 15 inches)

    2C--41 to 60 inches; light gray (5Y 7/2) loamy sand, light olive gray (5Y 6/2) moist; single grain, loose; few very fine roots; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  McCone County, Montana, 1981.

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretations Record:  MT0416.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches (A, Bw horizons); a cambic horizon from 5 to 15 inches (Bw horizon); accumulation of lime from 15 to 41 inches (Bk1, Bk2 horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bw, Bk1, Bk2 horizons).  Lisk soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
