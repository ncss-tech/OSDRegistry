LACREEK SERIES 

The Lacreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived siltstone.  These soils are on mountain slopes and scarp slopes.  Slopes are 20 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 1 degree C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Pachic Calcicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Lacreek channery silt loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

(10 to 25 cm thick)

    ABk--10 to 33 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) channery silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 15 percent channers; 20 percent prominent calcium carbonate coats on bottom surfaces of rock fragments and finely disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 25 cm thick)

(15 to 40 cm thick) 

    Bk2--66 to 130 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) channery silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate very fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 15 percent channers; 20 percent prominent calcium carbonate coats on bottom surfaces of rock fragments, 15 percent calcium carbonate masses in matrix, and finely disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); clear smooth boundary. (50 to 70 cm thick)

    BCk--130 to 200 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very channery clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine interstitial pores; 40 percent channers; 40 percent prominent calcium carbonate coats on bottom surfaces of rock fragments and finely disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).
