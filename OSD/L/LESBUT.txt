REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon
Mollic epipedon--zone from the surface to a depth of 46 cm (Ap, Bt1, Bt2, and Bk horizons)
Secondary calcium carbonates--zone from 33 to 150 cm (Bk1, 2Bk2, 2Bk3, and 2Bkq horizons)
Particle-size control section--zone from 25 to 100 cm (part of Bt2 horizon, Bk1 and 2Bk2 horizons, part of 2Bk3 horizons)

Some pedons have a cambic horizon. The Bw horizon does not meet the criteria for mollic in some areas.
