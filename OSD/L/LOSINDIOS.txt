LOSINDIOS SERIES

The Losindios series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from arkosic sandstone and shale.  Losindios soils are on toeslopes and valleys.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:   Losindios sandy loam, on a northeast facing, planar, 5 percent slope in ponderosa pine woodland at an elevation of 7250 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on August 1, 1995 the soil was moist from 2 to 54 inches.

(6 to 28 inches)

     C1--37 to 54 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine, common medium and coarse roots; common very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.

     C2--54 to 82 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0).
