LONGPEN SERIES

The Longpen series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess over colluvium weathered from basalt with an admixture of volcanic ash on the surface. Longpen soils are on canyon sides and structural benches and have slopes of 5 to 50 percent. Permeability is slow. The average annual precipitation is about 32 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Vitrandic Haploxeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Longpen ashy silt loam, on a 40 percent canyon side at 2,700 feet elevation on a south aspect. (When described on November 11, 1982 the soil was dry below 12 inches; colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

COMPETING SERIES: 

Talmaks soils - have EB and BE horizons above the Bt horizon

Sinkler - have Btxb horizons

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Longpen soils are on canyon sides and structural benches and have slopes of 5 to 50 percent. These soils formed in loess colluvium weathered from basalt with an admixture of volcanic ash. Elevation is 1,100 to 3,400 feet. The average annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F. The average annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 40 inches and the frost free season is 80 to 125 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Agatha, Klickson, and Setters soils. Agatha and Klickson soils are on canyon sides and are loamy-skeletal. Setters soils are on benches and have a fine textured control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Runoff is medium to rapid. Permeability is slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used mainly for timber production, livestock grazing, wildlife habitat and watershed. The natural vegetation is grand fir, Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine with an understory of mallow ninebark common snowberry, creambush oceanspray, rose and Rocky Mountain maple.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North-central Idaho; Longpen soils are not extensive.  MLRA 43A.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Clearwater County, Idaho, 2003.

REMARKS: Mass failures are common on this soil. The slowly permeable lower part of the soil causes lateral subsurface flow.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 9 inches (Oi, A1 and A2 horizons).

Argillic horizon - The zone from 9 to 71 inches (BtA, Bt1, Bt2, BE, 2Btb1, and 2Btb2 horizons).

Particle size control section - The zone from 9 to 29 inches (BtA, Bt1 and part of the Bt2 horizon).

The ranges listed under the A horizons for volcanic glass content and acid-oxalate extractable Fe + 1/2 Fe are estimates only.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Partial laboratory data is available for another pedon of Longpen.  Soil Survey Sample No. - S92ID-035-034.  Pedon No. - 93P 89.
